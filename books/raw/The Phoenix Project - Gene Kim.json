      "content": "I hate vague requests to meet. I only do that when I’m trying to schedule\n\na time to chew someone out. Or fire them.\n\nWait. Is Laura calling because someone wants to fire me? Was there an\n\noutage I didn’t respond to quickly enough? As an IT Operations guy, the\n\ncareer-ending outage is the joke my peers and I tell one another daily.\n\nWe agree to meet at her desk in a half hour, but when she doesn’t share\n\nany more details, I say in my most cajoling voice, “Laura, what’s this all\n\nabout? Is there a problem in my group? Or am I the one in trouble?” I laugh\n\nextra loudly, so she hears it over the phone.\n\n“No, it’s nothing like that,” she says breezily. “You could even say this\n\nis good news. Thanks, Bill.”\n\nWhen she hangs up, I try to think of what good news would even look\n\nlike these days. When I can’t, I turn the radio back on and immediately hear\n\na commercial from our largest retailing competitor. They’re talking about\n\ntheir unparalleled customer service and a breathtaking new offering that\n\nallows people to customize their cars with their friends online.\n\nThe ad is brilliant. I’d use the service in a second, if I weren’t such a\n\nloyal company man. How do they keep bringing such incredible new\n\ncapabilities to market while we remain stuck in the mud?\n\nI turn the radio off. Despite all our hard work and late nights, the\n\ncompetition keeps leapfrogging us. When our Marketing people hear this\n\nad, they’ll go ballistic. Because they’re likely art or music majors, not\n\npeople with a technology background, they’ll publicly promise the\n\nimpossible and IT will have to figure out how to deliver.\n\nEach year, it gets harder. We have to do more with less, to\n\nsimultaneously maintain competitiveness and reduce costs.\n\nSome days, I think that it can’t be done. Maybe I spent too much time as\n\na sergeant in the Marines. You learn that you argue your case as best as you\n\ncan with your officer, but sometimes you have to say, “Yes, sir,” and then\n\ngo take that hill.\n\nI pull into the parking lot. Three years ago, finding an empty parking\n\nspot was impossible. Now, after all the layoffs, parking is rarely a problem.\n\nWhen I walk into Building 5 where Laura and her staff reside, I\n\nimmediately notice how nicely furnished it is. I can smell the new carpeting\n\nand there’s even classy wood paneling on the walls. Suddenly, the paint and\n\ncarpet in my building seem decades overdue for replacement.\n\nThat’s IT’s lot in life. At least we’re not in a dingy, dimly lit dank\n\nbasement, like in the British TV show, The IT Crowd.\n\nWhen I get to Laura’s office, she looks up and smiles. “Good seeing you\n\nagain, Bill.” She extends her hand, which I shake. “Have a seat while I see\n\nwhether Steve Masters is available to meet.”\n\nSteve Masters? Our CEO?\n\nShe picks up and dials her phone while I sit down, looking around. The\n\nlast time I was here was a couple of years ago when HR notified us that we\n\nneeded to dedicate a room for nursing mothers. We were critically short of\n\noffice and meeting space, and we had big project deadlines looming.\n\nWe merely wanted to use a conference room in a different building.\n\nHowever, Wes made it sound like we were a bunch of 1950s Mad Men\n\nNeanderthals. Shortly afterward, we were both summoned here for a half\n\nday of political rehabilitation and sensitivity training. Thanks, Wes.\n\nAmong other things, Wes is in charge of the networks, which is why I\n\ntrack network outages so closely.\n\nLaura thanks the person on the other end of the phone and turns back to\n\nme. “Thanks for coming down on short notice. How is your family doing\n\nthese days?” she asks.\n\nMy brow furrows. If I wanted to chitchat, there are many people I’d\n\nrather talk to than someone in HR. I force myself to banter about our\n\nfamilies and kids, trying not to think about my other pressing commitments.\n\nEventually I say, without much grace, “So, what can I do for you this\n\nmorning?”\n\n“Of course.” She pauses, and then says, “Effective as of this morning,\n\nLuke and Damon are no longer with the company. This went all the way to\n\nthe top, with Steve getting involved. He’s chosen you to be the VP of IT\n\nOperations.”\n\nShe smiles broadly, holding out her hand again, “You’re our newest VP\n\nin the company, Bill. I think some congratulations are in order?”\n\nHoly crap. I numbly shake her hand.\n\nNo, no, no. The last thing I want is a “promotion.”\n\nLuke was our CIO, or Chief Information Officer. Damon worked for him\n\nand was my boss, in charge of IT Operations across the entire company.\n\nBoth gone, just like that.\n\nI didn’t see this coming. There wasn’t any chatter on the subspace radio.\n\nNothing.\n\nFor the last decade, like clockwork, new CIOs would come and go every\n\ntwo years. They stay just long enough to understand the acronyms, learn\n\nwhere the bathrooms are, implement a bunch of programs and initiatives to\n\nupset the apple cart, and then they’re gone.\n\nCIO stands for “Career Is Over.” And VPs of IT Operations don’t last\n\nmuch longer.\n\nI’ve figured out that the trick to a long career in IT Operations\n\nmanagement is to get enough seniority to get good things done but to keep\n\nyour head low enough to avoid the political battles that make you inherently\n\nvulnerable. I have absolutely no interest in becoming one of the VPs who\n\njust give each other PowerPoints all day long.\n\nFishing for more information, I joke, “Two executives leaving at the\n\nsame time? Were they stealing money from the stores late at night?”\n\nShe laughs, but quickly returns to her HR-trained deadpan, “They both\n\nchose to pursue other interests. More than that, you’ll have to find out from\n\nthem.”\n\nAs the saying goes, if your colleague tells you they’ve decided to quit, it\n\nwas voluntary. But when someone else tells you they’ve decided to quit, it\n\nwas mandatory.\n\nErgo, my boss and his boss were just whacked.\n\nThis is exactly why I don’t want a promotion. I’m extremely proud of\n\nthe team I’ve built over the last ten years. It’s not the largest group, but\n\nwe’re the most organized and dependable, by far. Especially compared to\n\nWes.\n\nI groan at the thought of managing Wes. He doesn’t manage a team—\n\nhe’s barely one step ahead of a chaotic mob.\n\nAs I break out in a cold sweat, I know I will never accept this\n\npromotion.\n\nAll this time, Laura has been talking, and I haven’t heard a single word.\n\n“—and so we’ll obviously need to talk about how we’re going to announce\n\nthis transition. And Steve wants to see you as soon as possible.”\n\n“Look, thanks for the opportunity. I’m honored. But I don’t want this\n\nrole. Why would I? I love my current job, and there are tons of important\n\nthings that still need to be done.”\n\n“I don’t think this is optional,” she says, looking sympathetic. “This\n\ncame straight from Steve. He chose you personally, so you’ll have to talk\n\nwith him.”\n\nI stand up and reiterate firmly, “No, really. Thanks for thinking of me,\n\nbut I’ve already got a great job. Good luck finding someone else.”\n\nMinutes later, Laura is walking me to Building 2, the tallest building on\n\ncampus. I’m angry at myself for getting sucked into this insanity.\n\nIf I run now, I’m pretty sure she wouldn’t be able to catch me, but then\n\nwhat? Steve would just send a whole squad of HR goons to fetch me.\n\nI don’t say anything, definitely not feeling like small talk anymore.\n\nLaura doesn’t seem to care, walking briskly beside me, nose buried in her\n\nphone, occasionally gesturing directions.\n\nShe finds Steve’s office without ever looking up, obviously having made\n\nthis walk many times before.\n\nThis floor is warm and inviting, furnished just like it was in the 1920s,\n\nwhen the building was constructed. With dark hardwood floors and stained\n\nglass windows, it’s from an era when everyone wore suits and smoked\n\ncigars in their offices. The company was booming then—Parts Unlimited\n\nmade various widgets inside almost every make of automobile, when horses\n\nwere being vanquished from daily life.\n\nSteve has a corner office, where a no-nonsense woman is keeping guard.\n\nShe’s about forty, radiating cheerfulness and a sense of organization and\n\norder. Her desk is tidy, with Post-it notes everywhere on the wall. There’s a\n\ncoffee mug with the words “Don’t Mess With Stacy” by her keyboard.\n\n“Hi, Laura,” she says, looking up from her computer. “Busy day, huh?\n\nSo, this is Bill?”\n\n“Yep. In the flesh,” Laura replies, smiling.\n\nTo me she says, “Stacy keeps Steve in line. You’ll grow to know her\n\nwell, I suspect. You and I can finish up later.” Then she leaves.\n\nStacy smiles at me. “Pleasure. I’ve heard a lot about you already. Steve\n\nis expecting you.” She points to his door.\n\nI immediately like her. And I think about what I’ve just learned. It’s\n\nbeen a busy day for Laura. Stacy and Laura are on very familiar terms.\n\nSteve has HR on speed dial. Apparently, people who work for Steve don’t\n\nlast long.\n\nGreat.\n\nWalking in, I’m a little surprised to find Steve’s office looks just like\n\nLaura’s. It’s the same size as my boss’ office—or rather, my ex-boss’\n\noffice—and potentially my new office if I’m stupid, which I am not.\n\nMaybe I was expecting Persian rugs, water fountains, and large\n\nsculptures everywhere. Instead, there are photos on the wall of a small\n\npropeller airplane, his smiling family, and, to my surprise, one of him in a\n\nUS Army uniform on a runway somewhere tropical. I note with surprise the\n\ninsignia visible on his lapels.\n\nSo, Steve was a major.\n\nHe is sitting behind his desk, scrutinizing what appear to be paper\n\nspreadsheets. There’s a laptop open behind him, displaying a browser full of\n\nstock graphs.\n\n“Bill, good to see you again,” he says, standing and shaking my hand.\n\n“It’s been a long time. About five years, right? It was after you pulled off\n\nthat amazing project to integrate one of the manufacturing acquisitions. I\n\ntrust life has been treating you well?”\n\nI’m surprised and a bit flattered that he remembered our brief\n\ninteraction, especially when it was so long ago. I smile in return, saying,\n\n“Yes, very well, thank you. I’m amazed you remember something so far\n\nback.”\n\n“You think we give out awards like that to just anyone?” he says\n\nearnestly. “That was an important project. To make that acquisition pay off,\n\nwe needed to nail it, which you and your team did superbly.\n\n“I’m sure Laura has told you a bit about the organizational changes I’ve\n\nmade. You know Luke and Damon are no longer with the company. I intend\n\nto fill the CIO position eventually, but in the meantime, all of IT will report to\n\nme.”\n\nHe continues, brisk and businesslike, “However, with Damon’s\n\ndeparture, I have an organizational hole I need to fill. Based on our\n\nresearch, you’re clearly the best candidate to take over as VP of IT\n\nOperations.”\n\nAs if he just remembered, he says, “You were a Marine. When and\n\nwhere?”\n\nI announce automatically, “222nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. Sergeant.\n\nI was in for six years but never saw combat.”\n\nRemembering how I joined the Marines as a cocky eighteen-year-old, I\n\nsay with a small smile, “The Corps really straightened me out—I owe them\n\na lot, but I sure hope neither of my sons join under the same conditions I\n\ndid.”\n\n“I bet,” Steve laughs. “I was in the Army for eight years myself, slightly\n\nlonger than I was obligated to. But I didn’t mind. ROTC was the only way I\n\ncould pay for college, and they treated me well.”\n\nHe adds, “They didn’t coddle us like they did you Marines, but I still\n\ncan’t complain.”\n\nI laugh, finding myself liking him. This is the longest interaction we’ve\n\nhad. I suddenly wonder if this is what politicians are like.\n\nI try to stay focused on why he summoned me here: He’s going to ask\n\nme to undertake some kamikaze mission.\n\n“Here’s the situation,” he says, motioning me to have a seat at his\n\nconference table. “As I’m sure you’re aware, we must regain profitability.\n\nTo do that, we need to increase our market share and average order sizes.\n\nOur retail competitors are kicking our ass. The whole world knows this,\n\nwhich is why our stock price is half what it was three years ago.”\n\nHe continues, “Project Phoenix is essential to closing the gap with the\n\ncompetition, so we can finally do what the competition has been doing for\n\nyears. Customers need to be able to buy from us from wherever they want,\n\nwhether it’s on the Internet or in our retail stores. Otherwise, we’ll soon\n\nhave no customers, at all.”\n\nI nod. I might be in the technology backwaters, but my team has been\n\ninvolved with Phoenix for years. Everyone knows how important it is.\n\n“We’re years late delivering,” he continues. “Our investors and Wall\n\nStreet are howling. And now, my board is losing confidence in our ability to\n\nhit our commitments.\n\n“I’ll be blunt,” he says. “The way things are going, I’ll be out of a job in\n\nsix months. As of last week, Bob Strauss, my old boss, is the new chairman\n\nof the company. There’s a vocal group of shareholders trying to split up the\n\ncompany, and I don’t know how much longer we can fend them off. What’s\n\nat stake here is not just my job, but the nearly four thousand employees who\n\nwork here at Parts Unlimited.”\n\nSuddenly, Steve looks much older than the early fifties I had guessed\n\nhim to be. Looking right at me, he says, “As acting CIO, Chris Allers, our VP\n\nof Application Development, will report to me. And so will you.”\n\nHe stands up and starts to pace, “I need you to keep all the things that\n\nare supposed to be up, well, up. I need someone reliable, who isn’t afraid to\n\ntell me bad news. Above all, I need someone I can trust to do the right\n\nthing. That integration project had many challenges, but you always kept a\n\ncool head. You’ve built a reputation as someone who is dependable,\n\npragmatic, and willing to say what you really think.”\n\nHe’s been candid with me, so I reply with the same. “Sir, with all due\n\nrespect, it seems very difficult for senior IT leadership to succeed here. Any\n\nrequest for budget or staff is always shot down, and executives are replaced\n\nso quickly, some never even get a chance to fully unpack.”\n\nWith finality, I say, “Midrange Operations is critical to getting Phoenix\n\ndone, too. I need to stay there to see those things through to completion. I\n\nappreciate you thinking of me, but I can’t accept. However, I promise I’ll\n\nkeep my eyes open for any good candidates.”\n\nSteve looks at me appraisingly, his expression surprisingly grave.\n\n“We’ve had to cut budgets across the entire company. That edict came\n\nstraight from my board. My hands were tied. I won’t make promises I can’t\n\nkeep, but I can promise you I’ll do whatever it takes to support you and\n\nyour mission.\n\n“Bill, I know you didn’t ask for this job, but the company’s survival is at\n\nstake here. I need you to help me save this great company. Can I count on\n\nyou?”\n\nOh, for chrissakes.\n\nBefore I can politely decline again, I suddenly hear myself saying, “Yes,\n\nsir, you can count on me.”\n\nI panic, realizing that Steve somehow used some Jedi mind trick on me. I\n\nforce myself to stop talking, before I make more dumb promises.\n\n“Congratulations,” Steve says, standing up and shaking my hand firmly.\n\nHe clasps my shoulder. “I knew you’d do the right thing. On behalf of the\n\nentire executive team, we’re grateful for you stepping up.”\n\nI look at his hand grasping mine, wondering if I can backpeddle my way\n\nout.\n\nNot a chance in hell, I decide.\n\nSwearing to myself, I say, “I’ll do my best, sir. And could you at least\n\nexplain why no one who accepts this position lasts very long? What do you\n\nwant most from me? And what don’t you want?”\n\nWith a resigned half smile, I add, “If I fail, I’ll try to make sure it’s in a\n\nnew and novel way.”\n\n“I like that!” Steve says, laughing loudly. “What I want is for IT to keep\n\nthe lights on. It should be like using the toilet. I use the toilet and, hell, I\n\ndon’t ever worry about it not working. What I don’t want is to have the\n\ntoilets back up and flood the entire building.” He smiles broadly at his own\n\njoke.\n\nGreat. In his mind, I’m a glorified janitor.\n\nHe continues, “You have a reputation of running the tightest ship in the\n\nIT organization. So I’m giving you the entire fleet. I expect you to make\n\nthem all run the same way.\n\n“I need Chris focused on Phoenix execution. Anything in your area of\n\nresponsibility that takes focus away from Phoenix is unacceptable. That\n\napplies not just to you and Chris, but everyone else in this company. Is that\n\nclear?”\n\n“Absolutely,” I say, nodding. “You want the IT systems to be reliable and\n\navailable, and for the business to be able to depend upon them. You want\n\ndisruptions to normal operations kept to an absolute minimum so that the\n\nbusiness can focus on getting Phoenix done.”\n\nLooking surprised, Steve nods. “Exactly. Yes, well put. Whatever you\n\nsaid, that’s exactly what I want.”\n\nHe hands me an e-mail printout from Dick Landry, the CFO.\n\nFrom: Dick Landry\n\nTo: Steve Masters\n\nDate: September 2, 8:27 AM\n\nPriority: Highest\n\nSubject: ACTION NEEDED: payroll run is failing\n\nHey, Steve. We’ve got serious issues with this week’s payroll.\n\nWe’re trying to figure out if the problem is with the numbers or in the\n\npayroll system. Either way, thousands of employees have paychecks\n\nstuck in system & are at risk of not getting paid. Seriously bad news.\n\nWe must fix this before payroll window closes at 5 PM today.\n\nPlease advise on how to escalate this, given the new IT org.\n\nDick\n\nI wince. Employees not getting paychecks means families not being able\n\nto pay their mortgages or put food on the table.\n\nSuddenly, I realize that my family’s mortgage payment is due in four\n\ndays, and we could be one of the families affected. A late mortgage\n\npayment could screw up our credit rating even more, which we spent years\n\nrepairing after we put Paige’s student loans on my credit card.\n\n“You want me to jump on this and manage the incident to conclusion?”\n\nSteve nods, giving me the thumbs-up. “Keep me posted on the progress,\n\nplease.” His expression turns grave. “Every responsible company takes care\n\nof its employees. Many of our factory workers live from paycheck to\n\npaycheck. Do not create hardship for their families, you hear? This could\n\nget us in trouble with the union, maybe even triggering a work-stoppage,\n\ncreating some very bad press for us.”\n\nI nod automatically. “Restore critical business operations and keep us\n\nout of the front-page news. Got it. Thanks.”\n\nWhy, exactly, I’m thanking him is not clear.\n\nChapter 2 • Tuesday, September 2\n\n“How’d it go in there?” Stacy asks kindly, looking up from her keyboard.\n\nI just shake my head. “I can’t believe it. He just talked me into taking a\n\nnew job I don’t want. How did that happen?”\n\n“He can be very persuasive,” she says. “For what it’s worth, he’s one-of-\n\na-kind. I’ve worked for him for nearly ten years, and I’ll follow him\n\nanywhere. Anything I can help with to make your job easier?”\n\nThinking for a moment, I ask, “There’s an urgent payroll issue that\n\nneeds to be fixed. Dick Landry is on floor three, right?”\n\n“Here you go,” she says, before I’ve finished asking my question,\n\nhanding me a Post-it note with all of Dick’s contact information. Office\n\nlocation, phone numbers, and everything.\n\nGrateful, I smile at her. “Thanks a lot—you are fantastic!”\n\nI dial Dick’s cell phone on my way to the elevator. “Dick here,” he\n\nanswers gruffly, still typing in the background.\n\n“This is Bill Palmer. Steve just made me the new VP of IT Operations,\n\nand he asked me to—”\n\n“Congratulations,” he interrupts. “Now look, my people found a huge\n\npayroll irregularity. When can you get to my office?”\n\n“Right away,” I reply. I hear the click of him ending the call. I’ve had\n\nwarmer welcomes.\n\nOn the third floor, I walk through Finance and Accounting, surrounded\n\nby pinstriped shirts and starched collars. I find Dick at his desk, still on the",

      "content": "phone with someone. When he sees me, he puts his hand over the\n\nmouthpiece. “You from IT?” he asks gruffly.\n\nWhen I nod, he says into the phone, “Look, I gotta run. Someone who’s\n\nsupposedly going to help is finally here. I’ll call you back.” Without waiting\n\nfor an answer, he hangs up the phone.\n\nI’ve never actually seen someone who routinely hangs up on people. I\n\nbrace myself for a conversation that is likely to be short on any comforting\n\n“let’s get to know each other” foreplay.\n\nAs if in a hostage situation, I slowly raise my hands, showing Dick the\n\nprinted e-mail. “Steve just told me about the payroll outage. What’s the best\n\nway for me to get some situational awareness here?”\n\n“We’re in deep kimchi,” Dick responds. “In yesterday’s payroll run, all\n\nof the records for the hourly employees went missing. We’re pretty damned\n\nsure it’s an IT issue. This screwup is preventing us from paying our\n\nemployees, violating countless state labor laws, and, no doubt, the union is\n\ngoing to scream bloody murder.”\n\nHe mutters under his breath for a moment. “Let’s go see Ann, my\n\nOperations Manager. She’s been pulling her hair out since yesterday\n\nafternoon.”\n\nWalking quickly to keep up, I nearly run into him when he stops and\n\npeers through a conference room window. He opens the door. “How’s it\n\ngoing in here, Ann?”\n\nThere are two well-dressed women in the room: one, around forty-five\n\nyears old, studies the whiteboard, filled with flowcharts and a lot of\n\ntabulated numbers, and the other, in her early thirties, types on a laptop.\n\nSpreadsheets are strewn all over the large conference room table. The older\n\nwoman gestures with an open marker at what appears to be a list of\n\npotential failure causes.\n\nSomething about the way they dress, and their concerned and irritated\n\nexpressions, makes me think they were recruited from a local accounting\n\nfirm. Ex-auditors. Good to have them on our side, I suppose.\n\nAnn shakes her head in exhausted frustration. “Not much progress, I’m\n\nafraid. We’re almost certain this is an IT systems failure in one of the\n\nupstream timekeeping systems. All of the hourly factory worker records got\n\nscrewed up in the last upload—”\n\nDick interrupts her. “This is Bill from IT. He’s been assigned to fix this\n\nmess or die trying, is what I think he said.”\n\nI say, “Hi, guys. I’ve just been made the new head of IT Operations. Can\n\nyou start from the beginning and tell me what you know about the\n\nproblem?”\n\nAnn walks over to the flowchart on the whiteboard. “Let’s start with the\n\ninformation flow. Our financial system gets payroll data from all our\n\nvarious divisions in different ways. We roll up all the numbers for salaried\n\nand hourly personnel, which includes wages and taxes. Sounds easy, but it’s\n\nextremely complex, because each state has different tax tables, labor laws,\n\nand so forth.\n\n“To make sure something doesn’t get screwed up,” she continues, “we\n\nmake sure the summarized numbers match the detailed numbers from each\n\ndivision.”\n\nAs I hurriedly jot down some notes, she continues, “It’s a pretty clunky\n\nand manual process. It works most of the time, but yesterday we discovered\n\nthat the general ledger upload for hourly production staff didn’t come\n\nthrough. All of the hourlies had zeroes for their hours worked and amount\n\ndue.\n\n“We’ve had so many problems with this particular upload,” she says,\n\nobviously frustrated, “that IT gave us a program that we use to do manual\n\ncorrections, so we don’t have to bother them anymore.”\n\nI wince. I don’t like finance personnel manually changing payroll data\n\noutside the payroll application. It’s error-prone and dangerous. Someone\n\ncould copy that data onto a USB drive or e-mail it outside of the\n\norganization, which is how organizations lose sensitive data.\n\n“Did you say all the numbers for salaried employees are okay?” I ask.\n\n“That’s right,” she replies.\n\n“But hourly employees are all zeroes,” I confirm.\n\n“Yep,” she again replies.\n\nInteresting. I ask, “Why do you think the payroll run failed when it was\n\nworking before? Have you had problems like this in the past?”\n\nShe shrugs. “Nothing like this has happened before. I have no idea what\n\ncould have caused it—no major changes were scheduled for this pay period.\n\nI’ve been asking the same questions, but until we hear from the IT guys,\n\nwe’re stuck dead in the water.”\n\n“What is our backup plan,” I ask, “if things are so hosed that we can’t\n\nget the hourly employee data in time?”\n\n“For crying out loud,” Dick says. “It’s in that e-mail you’re holding. The\n\ndeadline for electronic payments is 5 p.m., today. If we can’t hit that\n\nwindow, we may have to FedEx bales of paper checks to each of our\n\nfacilities for them to distribute to employees!”\n\nI frown at this scenario and so does the rest of the finance team.\n\n“That won’t work,” Ann says, clicking a marker on her teeth. “We’ve\n\noutsourced our payroll processing. Each pay period, we upload the payroll\n\ndata to them, which they then process. In the worst case, maybe we\n\ndownload the previous payroll run, modify it in a spreadsheet, and then re-\n\nupload it?\n\n“But because we don’t know how many hours each employee worked,\n\nwe don’t know how much to pay them!” she continues. “We don’t want to\n\noverpay anyone, but that’s better than accidentally underpaying them.”\n\nIt’s obvious that plan B is fraught with problems. We’d basically be\n\nguessing at people’s paychecks, as well as paying people who were\n\nterminated, and not paying people who were newly hired.\n\nTo get Finance the data they need, we may have to cobble together some\n\ncustom reports, which means bringing in the application developers or\n\ndatabase people.\n\nBut that’s like throwing gasoline on the fire. Developers are even worse\n\nthan networking people. Show me a developer who isn’t crashing\n\nproduction systems, and I’ll show you one who can’t fog a mirror. Or more\n\nlikely, is on vacation.\n\nDick says, “These are two lousy options. We could delay our payroll run\n\nuntil we have the correct data. But we can’t do this—even if we’re only a\n\nday late, we’ll have the union stepping in. So, that leaves Ann’s proposal of\n\npaying our employees something, even if it’s the incorrect amount. We’d\n\nhave to adjust everyone’s paycheck in the next pay period. But now we\n\nhave a financial reporting error that we’ve got to go back and fix.”\n\nHe pinches the bridge of his nose and continues to ramble. “We’ll have a\n\nbunch of odd journal entries in our general ledger, just when our auditors\n\nare here for our SOX-404 audits. When they see this, they’ll never leave.\n\n“Oh, Christ. A financial reporting error?” Dick mutters. “We’ll need\n\napproval from Steve. We’re going to have auditors camped out here until\n\nthe cows come home. No one’ll ever get any real work done again.”\n\nSOX-404 is short for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which Congress\n\nenacted in response to the accounting failures at Enron, WorldCom, and\n\nTyco. It means the CEO and CFO have to personally sign their names,\n\nattesting that their company’s financial statements are accurate.\n\nEveryone longs for the days when we didn’t spend half our time talking\n\nto auditors, complying with each new regulatory requirement du jour.\n\nI look at my notes and then at the clock. Time is running out.\n\n“Dick, based on what I’ve heard, I recommend that you continue to plan\n\nfor the worst and we fully document plan B, so we can pull it off without\n\nfurther complications. Furthermore, I request that we wait until 3 p.m.\n\nbefore making a decision. We may be still able to get all the systems and\n\ndata back.”\n\nWhen Ann nods, Dick says, “Okay, you’ve got four hours.”\n\nI say, “Rest assured that we understand the urgency of the situation and\n\nthat you’ll be apprised of how it’s going as soon as I find out myself.”\n\n“Thanks, Bill,” Ann says. Dick remains silent as I turn around and walk\n\nout the door.\n\nI feel better, now that I’ve seen the problem from the business\n\nperspective. It’s now time to get under the covers and find out what broke\n\nthe complex payroll machinery.\n\nWhile walking down the stairs, I dig out my phone and scan my e-mails.\n\nMy feeling of calm focus disappears when I see that Steve hasn’t sent out\n\nan announcement of my promotion. Wes Davis and Patty McKee, who until\n\ntoday were my peers, still have no idea that I’m now their new boss.\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nWhen I enter Building 7, it hits me. Our building is the ghetto of the\n\nentire Parts Unlimited campus.\n\nIt was built in the 1950s, and last remodeled in the 1970s, obviously\n\nbuilt for utility, not aesthetics. Building 7 used to be our large brake-pad\n\nmanufacturing factory until it was converted into data center and office\n\nspace. It looks old and neglected.\n\nThe security guard says cheerfully, “Hello, Mr. Palmer. How is the\n\nmorning going so far?”\n\nFor a moment, I’m tempted to ask him to wish me luck, so he can get\n\npaid the correct amount this week. Of course, I merely return his friendly\n\ngreeting.\n\nI’m headed toward the Network Operations Center, or as we call it, the\n\nNOC, where Wes and Patty are most likely to be. They’re now my two\n\nprimary managers.\n\nWes is Director of Distributed Technology Operations. He has technical\n\nresponsibility for over a thousand Windows servers, as well as the database\n\nand networking teams. Patty is the Director of IT Service Support. She owns\n\nall the level 1 and 2 help desk technicians who answer the phones around\n\nthe clock, handling break-fix issues and support requests from the business.\n\nShe also owns some of the key processes and tools that the entire IT\n\nOperations organization relies upon, like the trouble ticketing system,\n\nmonitoring, and running the change management meetings.\n\nI walk past rows upon rows of cubicles, the same as every other\n\nbuilding. However, unlike Buildings 2 and 5, I see peeling paint and dark\n\nstains seeping through the carpet.\n\nThis part of the building was built on top of what used to be the main\n\nassembly floor. When they converted it, they couldn’t get all the machine\n\noil cleaned up. No matter how much sealant we put down to coat the floors,\n\noil still has a tendency to seep through the carpet.\n\nI make a note to put in a budget request to replace the carpets and paint\n\nthe walls. In the Marines, keeping the barracks neat and tidy was not only\n\nfor aesthetics but also for safety.\n\nOld habits die hard.\n\nI hear the NOC before I see it. It’s a large bullpen area, with long tables\n\nset up along one wall, displaying the status of all the various IT services on\n\nlarge monitors. The level 1 and 2 help desk people sit at the three rows of\n\nworkstations.\n\nIt’s not exactly like mission control in Apollo 13, but that’s how I\n\nexplain it to my relatives.\n\nWhen something hits the fan, you need all the various stakeholders and\n\ntechnology managers to communicate and coordinate until the problem is\n\nresolved. Like now. At the conference table, fifteen people are in the midst\n\nof a loud and heated discussion, huddled around one of the classic gray\n\nspeakerphones that resembles a UFO.\n\nWes and Patty are sitting next to each other at the conference table, so I\n\nwalk behind them to listen in. Wes leans back in his chair with his arms\n\ncrossed over his stomach. They don’t get all the way across. At six feet\n\nthree inches tall and over 250 pounds, he casts a shadow on most people.\n\nHe seems to be in constant motion and has a reputation of saying whatever\n\nis on his mind.\n\nPatty is the complete opposite. Where Wes is loud, outspoken, and\n\nshoots from the hip, Patty is thoughtful, analytical, and a stickler for\n\nprocesses and procedures. Where Wes is large, combative, and sometimes\n\neven quarrelsome, Patty is elfin, logical, and levelheaded. She has a\n\nreputation for loving processes more than people and is often in the position\n\nof trying to impose order on the chaos in IT.\n\nShe’s the face of the entire IT organization. When things go wrong in IT,\n\npeople call Patty. She’s our professional apologist, whether it’s services\n\ncrashing, web pages taking too long to load, or, as in today’s case, missing\n\nor corrupted data.\n\nThey also call Patty when they need their work done—like upgrading a\n\ncomputer, changing a phone number, or deploying a new application. She\n\ndoes all of the scheduling, so people are always lobbying her to get their\n\nwork done first. She’ll then hand it off to people who do the work. For the\n\nmost part, they live in either my old group or in Wes’ group.\n\nWes pounds the table, saying, “Just get the vendor on the phone and tell\n\nthem that unless they get a tech down here pronto, we’re going to the\n\ncompetition. We’re one of their largest customers! We should probably have\n\nabandoned that pile of crap by now, come to think of it.”\n\nHe looks around and jokes, “You know the saying, right? The way you\n\ncan tell a vendor is lying is when their lips are moving.”\n\nOne of the engineers across from Wes says, “We have them on the\n\nphone right now. They say it’ll be at least four hours before their SAN field\n\nengineer is on-site.”\n\nI frown. Why are they talking about the SAN? Storage area networks\n\nprovide centralized storage to many of our most critical systems, so failures\n\nare typically global: It won’t be just one server that goes down; it’ll be\n\nhundreds of servers that go down all at once.\n\nWhile Wes starts arguing with the engineer, I try to think. Nothing about\n\nthis payroll run failure sounds like a SAN issue. Ann suggested that it was\n\nprobably something in the timekeeping applications supporting each plant.\n\n“But after we tried to rollback the SAN, it stopped serving data entirely,”\n\nanother engineer says. “Then the display started displaying everything in\n\nkanji! Well, we think it was kanji. Whatever it was, we couldn’t make heads\n\nor tails of those little pictures. That’s when we knew we needed to get the\n\nvendor involved.”\n\nAlthough I’m joining late, I’m convinced we’re totally on the wrong\n\ntrack.\n\nI lean in to whisper to Wes and Patty, “Can I get a minute with you guys\n\nin private?”\n\nWes turns and, without giving me his full attention, says loudly, “Can’t\n\nit wait? In case you haven’t noticed, we’re in the middle of a huge issue\n\nhere.”\n\nI put my hand firmly on his shoulder. “Wes, this is really important. It’s\n\nabout the payroll failure and concerns a conversation I just had with Steve\n\nMasters and Dick Landry.”\n\nHe looks surprised. Patty is already out of her chair. “Let’s use my\n\noffice,” she says, leading the way.\n\nFollowing Patty into her office, I see a photo on her wall of her\n\ndaughter, who I’d guess is eleven years old. I’m amazed at how much she\n\nlooks like Patty—fearless, incredibly smart, and formidable—in a way that\n\nis a bit scary in such a cute little girl.\n\nIn a gruff voice, Wes says, “Okay, Bill, what’s so important that you\n\nthink is worth interrupting a Sev 1 outage in progress?”\n\nThat’s not a bad question. Severity 1 outages are serious business-\n\nimpacting incidents that are so disruptive, we typically drop everything to\n\nresolve them. I take a deep breath. “I don’t know if you’ve heard, but Luke\n\nand Damon are no longer with the company. The official word is that\n\nthey’ve decided to take some time off. More than that, I don’t know.”\n\nThe surprised expressions on their faces confirm my suspicions. They\n\ndidn’t know. I quickly relate the events of the morning. Patty shakes her\n\nhead, uttering a tsk-tsk in disapproval.\n\nWes looks angry. He worked with Damon for many years. His face\n\nreddens. “So now we’re supposed to take orders from you? Look, no\n\noffense, pal, but aren’t you a little out of your league? You’ve managed the\n\nmidrange systems, which are basically antiques, for years. You created a\n\nnice little cushy job for yourself up there. And you know what? You have\n\nabsolutely no idea how to run modern distributed systems—to you, the\n\n1990s is still the future!\n\n“Quite frankly,” he says, “I think your head would explode if you had to\n\nlive with the relentless pace and complexity of what I deal with every day.”\n\nI exhale, while counting to three. “You want to talk to Steve about how\n\nyou want my job? Be my guest. Let’s get the business what they need first\n\nand make sure that everyone gets paid on time.”\n\nPatty responds quickly, “I know you weren’t asking me, but I agree that\n\nthe payroll incident needs to be our focus.” She pauses and then says, “I\n\nthink Steve made a good choice. Congratulations, Bill. When can we talk\n\nabout a bigger budget?”\n\nI flash her a small smile and a nod of thanks, returning my gaze to Wes.\n\nA couple moments go by, and expressions I can’t quite decipher cross\n\nhis face. Finally he relents, “Yeah, fine. And I will take you up on your offer\n\nto talk to Steve. He’s got a lot of explaining to do.”\n\nI nod. Thinking about my own experience with Steve, I genuinely wish\n\nWes luck if he actually decides to have a showdown with him.\n\n“Thank you for your support, guys. I appreciate it. Now, what do we\n\nknow about the failure—or failures? What’s all this about some SAN\n\nupgrade yesterday? Are they related?”\n\n“We don’t know,” Wes shakes his head. “We were trying to figure that\n\nout when you walked in. We were in the middle of a SAN firmware upgrade\n\nyesterday when the payroll run failed. Brent thought the SAN was corrupting\n\ndata, so he suggested we back out the changes. It made sense to me, but as\n\nyou know, they ended up bricking it.”\n\nUp until now, I’ve only heard “bricking” something in reference to\n\nbreaking something small, like when a cell phone update goes bad. Using it\n\nto refer to a million-dollar piece of equipment where all our irreplaceable\n\ncorporate data are stored makes me feel physically ill.\n\nBrent works for Wes. He’s always in the middle of the important\n\nprojects that IT is working on. I’ve worked with him many times. He’s\n\ndefinitely a smart guy but can be intimidating because of how much he\n\nknows. What makes it worse is that he’s right most of the time.\n\n“You heard them,” Wes says, gesturing toward the conference table\n\nwhere the outage meeting continues unabated. “The SAN won’t boot, won’t\n\nserve data, and our guys can’t even read any of the error messages on the\n\ndisplay because they’re in some weird language. Now we’ve got a bunch of\n\ndatabases down, including, of course, payroll.”\n\n“To work the SAN issue, we had to pull Brent off of a Phoenix job we\n\npromised to get done for Sarah,” Patty says ominously. “There’s going to be\n\nhell to pay.”\n\n“Uh-oh. What exactly did we promise her?” I ask, alarmed.\n\nSarah is the SVP of Retail Operations, and she also works for Steve. She\n\nhas an uncanny knack for blaming other people for her screwups, especially\n\nIT people. For years, she’s been able to escape any sort of real\n\naccountability.\n\nAlthough I’ve heard rumors that Steve is grooming her as his\n\nreplacement, I’ve always discounted that as being totally impossible. I’m\n\ncertain that Steve can’t be blind to her machinations.\n\n“Sarah heard from someone that we were late getting a bunch of virtual\n\nmachines over to Chris,” she replies. “We dropped everything to get on it.\n\nThat is, until we had to drop everything to fix the SAN.”\n\nChris Allers, our VP of Application Development, is responsible for\n\ndeveloping the applications and code that the business needs, which then\n\nget turned over to us to operate and maintain. Chris’ life is currently\n\ndominated by Phoenix.\n\nI scratch my head. As a company, we’ve made a huge investment in\n\nvirtualization. Although it looks uncannily like the mainframe operating\n\nenvironment from the 1960s, virtualization changed the game in Wes’\n\nworld. Suddenly, you don’t have to manage thousands of physical servers\n\nanymore. They’re now logical instances inside of one big-iron server or\n\nmaybe even residing somewhere in the cloud.\n\nBuilding a new server is now a right-click inside of an application.\n\nCabling? It’s now a configuration setting. But despite the promise that\n\nvirtualization was going to solve all our problems, here we are—still late in\n\ndelivering a virtual machine to Chris.\n\n“If we need Brent to work the SAN issue, keep him there. I’ll handle\n\nSarah,” I say. “But if the payroll failure was caused by the SAN, why didn’t\n\nwe see more widespread outages and failures?”\n\n“Sarah is definitely going to be one unhappy camper. You know,\n\nsuddenly I don’t want your job anymore,” Wes says with a loud laugh.\n\n“Don’t get yourself fired on your first day. They’ll probably come for me\n\nnext!”\n\nWes pauses to think. “You know, you have a good point about the SAN.\n\nBrent is working the issue right now. Let’s go to his desk and see what he\n\nthinks.”\n\nPatty and I both nod. It’s a good idea. We need to establish an accurate\n\ntimeline of relevant events. And so far, we’re basing everything on hearsay.\n\nThat doesn’t work for solving crimes, and it definitely doesn’t work for\n\nsolving outages.\n\nChapter 3 • Tuesday, September 2\n\nI follow Patty and Wes as they walk past the NOC, into the sea of cubicles.\n\nWe end up in a giant workspace created by combining six cubicles. A large\n\ntable sits against one wall with a keyboard and four LCD monitors, like a\n\nWall Street trading desk. There are piles of servers everywhere, all with\n\nblinking lights. Each portion of the desk is covered by more monitors,\n\nshowing graphs, login windows, code editors, Word documents, and\n\ncountless applications I don’t recognize.\n\nBrent types away in a window, oblivious to everything around him.\n\nFrom his phone, I hear the NOC conference line. He obviously doesn’t seem\n\nworried that the loud speakerphone might bother his neighbors.\n\n“Hey, Brent. You got a minute?” Wes asks loudly, putting a hand on his\n\nshoulder.\n\n“Can it wait?” Brent replies without even looking up. “I’m actually kind\n\nof busy right now. Working the SAN issue, you know?”\n\nWes grabs a chair. “Yeah, that’s what we’re here to talk about.”\n\nWhen Brent turns around, Wes continues, “Tell me again about last\n\nnight. What made you conclude that the SAN upgrade caused the payroll run\n\nfailure?”\n\nBrent rolls his eyes, “I was helping one of the SAN engineers perform the\n\nfirmware upgrade after everybody went home. It took way longer than we\n\nthought—nothing went according to the tech note. It got pretty hairy, but\n\nwe finally finished around seven o'clock.",

We\n\nworked it for about fifteen minutes, trying to figure out what went wrong.\n\nThat’s when we got the e-mails about the payroll run failing. That’s when I\n\nsaid, ‘Game Over.’\n\n“We were just too many versions behind. The SAN vendor probably\n\nnever tested the upgrade path we were going down. I called you, telling you\n\nI wanted to pull the plug. When you gave me the nod, we started the\n\nrollback.\n\n“That’s when the SAN crashed,” he says, slumping in his chair. “It not\n\nonly took down payroll but a bunch of other servers, too.”\n\n“We’ve been meaning to upgrade the SAN firmware for years, but we\n\nnever got around to it,” Wes explains, turning to me. “We came close once,\n\nbut then we couldn’t get a big enough maintenance window. Performance\n\nhas been getting worse and worse, to the point where a bunch of critical\n\napps were being impacted. So finally, last night, we decided to just bite the\n\nbullet and do the upgrade.”\n\nI nod. Then, my phone rings.\n\nIt’s Ann, so I put her on speakerphone.\n\n“As you suggested, we looked at the data we pulled from the payroll\n\ndatabase yesterday. The last pay period was fine. But for this pay period, all\n\nthe Social Security numbers for the factory hourlies are complete gibberish.\n\nAnd all their hours worked and wage fields are zeroes, too. No one has ever\n\nseen anything like this before.”\n\n“Just one field is gibberish?” I ask, raising my eyebrows in surprise.\n\n“What do you mean by ‘gibberish’? What’s in the fields?”\n\nShe tries to describe what she’s seeing on her screen. “Well, they’re not\n\nnumbers or letters. There’s some hearts and spades and some squiggly\n\ncharacters… And there’s a bunch of foreign characters with umlauts… And\n\nthere are no spaces. Is that important?”\n\nWhen Brent snickers as he hears Ann trying to read line noise aloud, I\n\ngive him a stern glance. “I think we’ve got the picture,” I say. “This is a\n\nvery important clue. Can you send the spreadsheet with the corrupted data\n\nto me?”\n\nShe agrees. “By the way, are a bunch of databases down now? That’s\n\nfunny. They were up last night.”\n\nWes mutters something under his breath, silencing Brent before he can\n\nsay anything.\n\n“Umm, yes. We’re aware of the problem and we’re working it, too,” I\n\ndeadpan.\n\nWhen we hang up, I breathe a sigh of relief, taking a moment to thank\n\nwhatever deity protects people who fight fires and fix outages.\n\n“Only one field corrupted in the database? Come on, guys, that\n\ndefinitely doesn’t sound like a SAN failure.” I say. “Brent, what else was\n\ngoing on yesterday, besides the SAN upgrade, that could have caused the\n\npayroll run to fail?”\n\nBrent slouches in his chair, spinning it around while he thinks. “Well,\n\nnow that you mention it… A developer for the timekeeping application\n\ncalled me yesterday with a strange question about the database table\n\nstructure. I was in the middle of working on that Phoenix test VM, so I gave\n\nhim a really quick answer so I could get back to work. You don’t suppose\n\nhe did something to break the app, do you?”\n\nWes turns quickly to the speakerphone dialed into the NOC conference\n\ncall that has been on this whole time and unmutes the phone. “Hey, guys,\n\nit’s Wes here. I’m with Brent and Patty, as well as with our new boss, Bill\n\nPalmer. Steve Masters has put him charge of all of IT Ops. So listen up,\n\nguys.”\n\nMy desire for an orderly announcement of my new role seems less and\n\nless likely.\n\nWes continues, “Does anyone know anything about a developer making\n\nany changes to the timekeeping application in the factories? Brent says he\n\ngot a call from someone who asked about changing some database tables.”\n\nFrom the speakerphone, a voice pipes up, “Yeah, I was helping someone\n\nwho was having some connectivity issues with the plants. I’m pretty sure he\n\nwas a developer maintaining the timekeeping app. He was installing some\n\nsecurity application that John needed to get up and running this week. I\n\nthink his name was Max. I still have his contact information around here\n\nsomewhere… He said he was going on vacation today, which is why the\n\nwork was so urgent.”\n\nNow we’re getting somewhere.\n\nA developer jamming in an urgent change so he could go on vacation—\n\npossibly as part of some urgent project being driven by John Pesche, our\n\nChief Information Security Officer.\n\nSituations like this only reinforce my deep suspicion of developers:\n\nthey’re often carelessly breaking things and then disappearing, leaving\n\nOperations to clean up the mess.\n\nThe only thing more dangerous than a developer is a developer\n\nconspiring with Security. The two working together gives us means, motive,\n\nand opportunity.\n\nI’m guessing our CISO probably strong-armed a Development manager\n\nto do something, which resulted in a developer doing something else, which\n\nbroke the payroll run.\n\nInformation Security is always flashing their badges at people and\n\nmaking urgent demands, regardless of the consequences to the rest of the\n\norganization, which is why we don’t invite them to many meetings. The\n\nbest way to make sure something doesn’t get done is to have them in the\n\nroom.\n\nThey’re always coming up with a million reasons why anything we do\n\nwill create a security hole that alien space-hackers will exploit to pillage our\n\nentire organization and steal all our code, intellectual property, credit card\n\nnumbers, and pictures of our loved ones. These are potentially valid risks,\n\nbut I often can’t connect the dots between their shrill, hysterical, and self-\n\nrighteous demands and actually improving the defensibility of our\n\nenvironment.\n\n“Okay, guys,” I say decisively. “The payroll run failure is like a crime\n\nscene and we’re Scotland Yard. The SAN is no longer a suspect, but\n\nunfortunately, we’ve accidentally maimed it during our investigation. Brent,\n\nyou keep working on the injured SAN—obviously, we’ve got to get it up and\n\nrunning soon.\n\n“Wes and Patty, our new persons of interest are Max and his manager,” I\n\nsay. “Do whatever it takes to find them, detain them, and figure out what\n\nthey did. I don’t care if Max is on vacation. I’m guessing he probably\n\nmessed up something, and we need to fix it by 3 p.m.”\n\nI think for a moment. “I’m going to find John. Either of you want to join\n\nme?”\n\nWes and Patty argue over who will help interrogate John. Patty says\n\nadamantly, “It should be me. I’ve been trying to keep John’s people in line\n\nfor years. They never follow our process, and it always causes problems. I’d\n\nlove to see Steve and Dick rake him over the coals for pulling a stunt like\n\nthis.”\n\nIt is apparently a convincing argument, as Wes says, “Okay, he’s all\n\nyours. I almost feel sorry for him now.”\n\nI suddenly regret my choice of words. This isn’t a witch hunt, and I’m\n\nnot looking for retribution. We still need a timeline of all relevant events\n\nleading up to the failure.\n\nJumping to inappropriate conclusions caused the SAN failure last night.\n\nWe won’t make these kinds of mistakes again. Not on my watch.\n\nAs Patty and I call John, I squint at the phone number on Patty’s screen,\n\nwondering if it’s time to heed my wife’s advice to get glasses. Yet another\n\nreminder that forty is just around the corner.\n\nI dial the number, and a voice answers in one ring, “John here.”\n\nI quickly tell him about the payroll and SAN failure and then ask, “Did\n\nyou make any changes to the timekeeping application yesterday?”\n\nHe says, “That sounds bad, but I can assure you that we didn’t make any\n\nchanges to your midrange systems. Sorry I can’t be of more help.”\n\nI sigh. I thought that by now either Steve or Laura would have sent out\n\nthe announcement of my promotion. I seem destined to explain my new role\n\nin every interaction I have.\n\nI wonder if it would be easier if I just sent out the announcement myself.\n\nI repeat the abridged story of my hasty promotion yet again. “Wes,\n\nPatty, and I heard that you were working with Max to deploy something\n\nurgent yesterday. What was it?”\n\n“Luke and Damon are gone?” John sounds surprised. “I never thought\n\nthat Steve would actually fire both of them over a compliance audit finding.\n\nBut who knows? Maybe things are finally starting to change around here.\n\nLet this be a lesson to you, Bill. You Operations people can’t keep dragging\n\nyour feet on security issues anymore! Just some friendly advice…\n\n“Speaking of which, I’m suspicious about how the competition keeps\n\ngetting the jump on us,” he continues. “As they say, once is coincidence.\n\nTwice is happenstance. Third must be enemy action. Maybe our\n\nsalespeople’s e-mail systems have been hacked. That would sure explain\n\nwhy we’re losing so many deals.”\n\nJohn continues to talk, but my mind is still stuck at his suggestion that\n\nLuke and Damon may have been fired over something security related. It’s\n\npossible—John routinely deals with some pretty powerful people, like\n\nSteve and the board as well as the internal and external auditors.\n\nHowever, I’m certain Steve didn’t mention either John or Information\n\nSecurity as reasons for their departure—only the need to focus on Phoenix.\n\nI look at Patty questioningly. She just rolls her eyes and then twirls her\n\nfinger around her ear. Clearly, she thinks John’s theory is crazy.\n\n“Has Steve given you any insights on the new org structure?” I ask out\n\nof genuine curiosity—John is always complaining that information security\n\nwas always prioritized too low. He’s been lobbying to become a peer of the\n\nCIO, saying it would resolve an inherent conflict of interest. To my\n\nknowledge, he hadn’t succeeded.\n\nIt’s no secret that Luke and Damon sidelined John as much as possible,\n\nso he couldn’t interfere with people who did real work. John still managed\n\nto show up at meetings, despite their best efforts.\n\n“What? I have no clue what’s going on,” he says in an aggrieved tone,\n\nmy question apparently striking a nerve. “I’m being kept in the dark, like\n\nusual. I’ll probably be the last to find out, too, if history is any guide. Until\n\nyou told me, I thought I was still reporting to Luke. And now that he’s gone,\n\nI don’t know who I’m reporting to. You got a call from Steve?”\n\n“This is all above my pay grade—I’m as much in the dark as you are,” I\n\nrespond, playing it dumb. Quickly changing the subject, I ask, “What can\n\nyou tell us about the timekeeping app change?”\n\n“I’ll call Steve and find out what’s going on. He’s probably forgotten\n\nInformation Security even exists,” he continues, making me wonder\n\nwhether we’ll ever be able to talk about payroll.\n\nTo my relief, he finally says, “Okay, yeah, you were asking about Max.\n\nWe had an urgent audit issue around storage of PII—that is, personally\n\nidentifiable information like SSNs—that’s Social Security numbers,\n\nobviously, birthdays, and so forth. European Union law and now many US\n\nstate laws prohibit us from storing that kind of data. We got a huge audit\n\nfinding around this. I knew it was up to my team to save this company from\n\nitself and prevent us from getting dinged again. That would be front-page\n\nnews, you know?”\n\nHe continues, “We found a product that tokenized this information, so\n\nwe no longer have to store the SSNs. It was supposed to be deployed almost\n\na year ago, but it never got done, despite all my badgering. Now we’re out\n\nof time. The Payment Card Industry auditors, that’s PCI for short, are here\n\nlater this month, so I fast-tracked the work with the timekeeping team to get\n\nit done.”\n\nI stare at my phone, speechless.\n\nOn the one hand, I’m ecstatic because we’ve found the smoking gun in\n\nJohn’s hand. John’s mention of the SSN field matches Ann’s description of\n\nthe corrupted data.\n\nOn the other hand: “Let me see if I’ve got this right…” I say slowly.\n\n“You deployed this tokenization application to fix an audit finding, which\n\ncaused the payroll run failure, which has Dick and Steve climbing the\n\nwalls?”\n\nJohn responds hotly, “First, I am quite certain the tokenization security\n\nproduct didn’t cause the issue. It’s inconceivable. The vendor assured us\n\nthat it’s safe, and we checked all their references. Second, Dick and Steve\n\nhave every reason to be climbing the walls: Compliance is not optional. It’s\n\nthe law. My job is to keep them out of orange jumpsuits, and so I did what I\n\nhad to do.”\n\n“‘Orange jumpsuits?’”\n\n“Like what you wear in prison,” he says. “My job is to keep\n\nmanagement in compliance with all relevant laws, regulations, and\n\ncontractual obligations. Luke and Damon were reckless. They cut corners\n\nthat severely affected our audit and security posture. If it weren’t for my\n\nactions, we’d probably all be in jail by now.”\n\nI thought we were talking about a payroll failure not being thrown in jail\n\nby some imaginary police force.\n\n“John, we have processes and procedures for how you introduce\n\nchanges into production,” Patty says. “You went around them, and, once\n\nagain, you’ve caused a big problem that we’re having to repair. Why didn’t\n\nyou follow the process?”\n\n“Ha! Good one, Patty,” John snorts. “I did follow the process. You know\n\nwhat your people told me? That the next possible deployment window was\n\nin four months. Hello? The auditors are on-site next week!”\n\nHe says adamantly, “Getting trapped in your bureaucratic process was\n\nsimply not an option. If you were in my shoes, you’d do the same thing.”\n\nPatty reddens. I say calmly, “According to Dick, we have fewer than\n\nfour hours to get the timekeeping app up. Now that we know there was a\n\nchange that affected SSNs, I think we have what we need.”\n\nI continue, “Max, who helped with the deployment, is on vacation today.\n\nWes or Brent will be contacting you to learn more about this tokenization\n\nproduct you deployed. I know you’ll provide them with whatever help they\n\nneed. This is important.”\n\nWhen John agrees, I thank him for his time. “Wait, one more question.\n\nWhy do you believe that this product didn’t cause the failure? Did you test\n\nthe change?”\n\nThere’s a short silence on the phone before John replies, “No, we\n\ncouldn’t test the change. There’s no test environment. Apparently, you guys\n\nrequested a budget years ago, but…”\n\nI should have known.\n\n“Well, that’s good news,” Patty says after John hangs up. “It may not be\n\neasy to fix, but at least we finally know what’s going on.”\n\n“Was John’s tokenization change in the change schedule?” I ask.\n\nShe laughs humorlessly. “That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you. John\n\nrarely goes through our change process. Nor do most people, for that matter.\n\nIt’s like the Wild West out here. We’re mostly shooting from the hip.”\n\nShe says defensively. “We need more process around here and better\n\nsupport from the top, including IT process tooling and training. Everyone\n\nthinks that the real way to get work done is to just do it. That makes my job\n\nnearly impossible.”\n\nIn my old group, we were always disciplined about doing changes. No\n\none made changes without telling everyone else, and we’d bend over\n\nbackward to make sure our changes wouldn’t screw someone else up.\n\nI’m not used to flying this blind.\n\n“We don’t have time to do interrogations every time something goes\n\nwrong,” I say, exasperated. “Get me a list of all the changes made in the\n\npast, say, three days. Without an accurate timeline, we won’t be able to\n\nestablish cause and effect, and we’ll probably end up causing another\n\noutage.”\n\n“Good idea,” she nods. “If necessary, I’ll e-mail everyone in IT to find\n\nout what they were doing, to catch things that weren’t on our schedule.”\n\n“What do you mean, ‘e-mail everyone?’ There’s no system where\n\npeople put in their changes? What about our ticketing system or the change-\n\nauthorization system?” I ask, stunned. This is like Scotland Yard e-mailing\n\neveryone in London to find out who was near the scene of a crime.\n\n“Dream on,” she says, looking at me like I’m a newbie, which I suppose\n\nI am. “For years, I’ve been trying to get people to use our change\n\nmanagement process and tools. But just like John, no one uses it. Same with\n\nour ticketing system. It’s pretty hit-or-miss, too.”\n\nThings are far worse than I thought.\n\n“Okay, do what you need to do,” I finally say, unable to hide my\n\nfrustration. “Make sure you hit all the developers supporting the\n\ntimekeeping system as well as all the system administrators and networking\n\npeople. Call their managers, and tell them it’s important that we know about\n\nany changes, regardless of how unimportant they may seem. Don’t forget\n\nJohn’s people, too.”\n\nWhen Patty nods, I say, “Look, you’re the change manager. We’ve got\n\nto do better than this. We need better situational awareness, and that means\n\nwe need some sort of functional change management process. Get everyone\n\nto bring in their changes so we can build a picture of what is actually going\n\non out there.”\n\nTo my surprise, Patty looks dejected. “Look, I’ve tried this before. I’ll\n\ntell you what will happen. The Change Advisory Board, or CAB, will get\n\ntogether once or twice. And within a couple of weeks, people will stop\n\nattending, saying they’re too busy. Or they’ll just make the changes without\n\nwaiting for authorization because of deadline pressures. Either way, it’ll\n\nfizzle out within a month.”\n\n“Not this time,” I say adamantly. “Send out a meeting notice to all the\n\ntechnology leads and announce that attendance is not optional. If they can’t\n\nmake it, they need to send a delegate. When is the next meeting?”\n\n“Tomorrow,” she says.\n\n“Excellent,” I say with genuine enthusiasm. “I’m looking forward to it.”\n\nWhen I finally get home, it’s after midnight. After a long day of\n\ndisappointments, I’m exhausted. Balloons are on the floor and a half-empty\n\nbottle of wine sits on the kitchen table. On the wall is a crayon poster\n\nsaying, “Congratulations Daddy!”\n\nWhen I called my wife, Paige, this afternoon telling her about my\n\npromotion, she was far happier than I was. She insisted on inviting the\n\nneighbors over to throw a little celebration. Coming home so late, I missed\n\nmy own party.\n\nAt 2 p.m., Patty had successfully argued that of the twenty-seven\n\nchanges made in the past three days, only John’s tokenization change and\n\nthe SAN upgrade could be reasonably linked to the payroll failure. However,\n\nWes and his team were still unable to restore SAN operations.\n\nAt 3 p.m., I had to tell Ann and Dick the bad news that we had no choice\n\nbut to execute plan B. Their frustration and disappointment were all too\n\nevident.\n\nIt wasn’t until 7 p.m. when the timekeeping application was back up and\n\n11 p.m. when the SAN was finally brought back online.\n\nNot a great performance on my first day as VP of IT Operations.\n\nBefore I left work, I e-mailed Steve, Dick, and Ann a quick status report,\n\npromising to do whatever it takes to prevent this type of failure from\n\nhappening again.\n\nI go upstairs, finish brushing my teeth, and check my phone one last\n\ntime before going to bed, being careful not to wake up Paige. I curse when I\n\nsee an e-mail from our company PR manager, with a subject of “Bad news.\n\nWe may be on the front page tomorrow…”\n\nI sit on the bed, squinting to read the accompanying news story.\n\nElkhart Grove Herald Times Parts Unlimited flubs paychecks, local union leader calls failure ‘unconscionable’\n\nAutomotive parts supplier Parts Unlimited has failed to\n\nadequately compensate its workers, with some employees receiving\n\nno pay at all, according to a Parts Unlimited internal memo. The\n\nlocally headquartered company admitted that it had failed to issue\n\ncorrect paychecks to some of its hourly factory workers and that\n\nothers hadn’t received any compensation for their work. Parts\n\nUnlimited denies that the issue is connected to cash flow problems\n\nand instead attributes the error to a payroll system failure.\n\nThe once high-flying $4 billion company has been plagued by\n\nflagging revenue and growing losses in recent quarters. These\n\nfinancial woes, which some blame on a failure of upper management,\n\nhave led to rampant job insecurity among local workers struggling to\n\nsupport their families.\n\nAccording to the memo, whatever the cause of the payroll failure,\n\nemployees might have to wait days or weeks to be compensated.\n\n“This is just the latest in a long string of management execution\n\nmissteps taken by the company in recent years,” according to Nestor\n\nMeyers Chief Industry Analyst Kelly Lawrence.\n\nParts Unlimited CFO Dick Landry did not return phone calls from\n\nthe Herald Times requesting comment on the payroll issue,\n\naccounting errors and questions of managerial competency.\n\nIn a statement issued on behalf of Parts Unlimited, Landry\n\nexpressed regret at the “glitch,” and vowed that the mistake would\n\nnot be repeated.\n\nThe Herald Times will continue to post updates as the story\n\nprogresses.\n\nToo tired to do anything more, I turn off the lights, making a mental note\n\nto myself to find Dick tomorrow to apologize in person. I close my eyes and\n\ntry to sleep.\n\nAn hour later I’m still staring at the ceiling, very much awake.\n\nChapter 4 • Wednesday, September 3\n\nI drink my coffee as I open up my laptop at 7:30 a.m., hoping to get through\n\nmy e-mails and voicemails before my 8 a.m. meeting. I stare at the screen.\n\nIn the twenty-two hours since I was promoted, 526 new e-mails have\n\narrived in my inbox.\n\nHoly crap.\n\nI skip all the messages about yesterday’s failure and am startled by all\n\nthe congratulatory notes from vendors, wanting to meet for lunch. How did\n\nthey find out? I’m pretty sure most of my organization still doesn’t know.\n\nI read an e-mail from Ellen, my former boss’ assistant, who is now\n\nassigned to support me, congratulating me and asking when we can meet. I\n\nreply, telling her I’d like to take her out for coffee this morning. I send a\n\nnote to the IT service desk, requesting that Ellen be granted access to my\n\ncalendar.\n\nA blinking red light on my desk phone catches my attention. It reads,\n\n“7:50 a.m. 62 new voicemails.”\n\nMy jaw drops. It would take an hour I don’t have just to listen to them. I\n\ne-mail Ellen again, asking her to go through all my voicemails, transcribing\n\nany that require action.\n\nBefore I hit send, I quickly add, “If there are any messages from Steve\n\nor Dick, please call me right away on my cell phone.”\n\nGrabbing my clipboard, I hurry toward my first meeting when my phone\n\nvibrates. It’s an urgent e-mail:",

      "content": "From: Sarah Moulton\n\nTo: Bill Palmer\n\nCc: Steve Masters\n\nDate: September 3, 7:58 AM\n\nPriority: Highest\n\nSubject: Latest Phoenix slip\n\nBill, as you know, Project Phoenix is the most important project\n\nthis company is undertaking. I’ve heard disturbing rumors that you\n\nare holding up the release.\n\nI don’t need to remind you that our competition isn’t standing\n\nstill. Each day that goes by, our market share goes down. I need\n\neveryone to have a sense of urgency. Especially from you, Bill.\n\nWe have an emergency project management meeting at 10 AM\n\ntoday. Please join us, and be prepared to explain these unacceptable\n\ndelays.\n\nSteve, I know how important this project is for you, given the\n\ncommitments you’ve made to the board. Please feel free to attend.\n\nWe’d love your perspective.\n\nRegards,\n\nSarah\n\nGoddamnit.\n\nI forward the e-mail to Wes and Patty, flagging it as high priority.\n\nSomething seems wrong in a world where half the e-mail messages sent are\n\nurgent. Can everything really be that important?\n\nI call Wes’ cell phone. “I just got your e-mail from Sarah,” he says.\n\n“What utter bullshit.”\n\n“What’s this all this about?” I ask.\n\nHe says, “I’m pretty sure it’s about Brent not finishing up that\n\nconfiguration work for the Phoenix developers. Everyone is chasing their\n\ntails because the developers can’t actually tell us what the test environment\n\nshould look like. We’re doing our best, but every time we deliver\n\nsomething, they tell us we did it wrong.”\n\n“When did they tell us about it?” I ask.\n\n“Two weeks ago. It’s the typical bullshit with Development, but worse.\n\nThey’re so freaked out about hitting their deadlines, they’re only now\n\nstarting to think about how to test and deploy it. Apparently, they’re making\n\nit our problem. I hope you’re wearing your asbestos underwear like me.\n\nSarah is going to be at that meeting with torches, wanting to throw us onto\n\nthe bonfire.”\n\nIt’s amazing to me how handoffs between Development and IT\n\nOperations always get screwed up. But given the perpetual tribal warfare\n\nbetween the two groups, maybe I shouldn’t be surprised.\n\nI reply, “I get the picture. Look, make sure you dig into this Dev\n\nspecification issue personally. We’ve got to get this nailed down—grab\n\neveryone involved, whether they’re in Dev or Ops, and lock them in a room\n\nuntil they come up with a written specification. Phoenix is so important, we\n\ncan’t afford to screw this up.”\n\nWes says he’s on it, and I ask, “Is there anything else Sarah could pop\n\non us?”\n\nHe pauses to think and finally says, “No, I don’t think so. We have a\n\npretty valid reason, with the payroll run failure, for why Brent wasn’t able\n\nto complete his work.”\n\nI agree. Feeling like our asses are sufficiently covered, I say, “See you at\n\nten.”\n\nLess than an hour later, I’m walking to Building 9 in the hot sunshine,\n\nwhere many of the Marketing folks call home. To my surprise, I join a small\n\narmy of IT people walking the same way. Why?\n\nThen it hits me. The majority of our marketing projects can’t be done\n\nwithout IT. High touch marketing requires high tech. But if there’s so many\n\nof us assigned to these Marketing projects, shouldn’t they be coming to us?\n\nI imagine that Sarah likes it this way, the spider sitting back, enjoying\n\nseeing all the company minions making their way to her lair.\n\nI arrive and immediately see Kirsten Fingle, who runs the Project\n\nManagement Office sitting at the head of the table. I am a big fan of hers.\n\nShe is organized, levelheaded, and a stickler for accountability. When she\n\nfirst joined the company five years ago, she brought a whole new level of\n\nprofessionalism to our organization.\n\nAt her right, Sarah leans back in her chair, tapping away on her iPhone,\n\noblivious to the rest of us.\n\nSarah is my age: thirty-nine. She’s very guarded about her age, always\n\nsaying things in a way that would lead one to conclude she’s much older,\n\nbut never actually lying.\n\nYet another maddening thing about Sarah.\n\nThere are about twenty-five people in the room. Many of the business\n\nline owners are here, some of whom work for Sarah. Chris Allers is also\n\nhere. Chris is a little older than me and looks lean and fit. He’ll just as often\n\nbe seen joking with someone as kicking their ass about missing a deadline.\n\nHe has a reputation as a capable and no-nonsense manager. With nearly two\n\nhundred developers working for him, he needs to be.\n\nTo help with Phoenix, his team has grown by fifty people in the last two\n\nyears, many through offshore development shops. Chris is constantly asked\n\nto deliver more features and do it in less time, with less money.\n\nSeveral of his managers are in the room, too. Wes is also here, sitting\n\nright next to Chris. As I start to look for an open chair, I note how everyone\n\nseems unusually tense. And then I see why.\n\nThere, sitting right next to the only open seat at the table, is Steve.\n\nEveryone seems to be going to great lengths to not stare at him. As I\n\ncasually take my seat next to Steve, my phone vibrates. It’s a text message\n\nfrom Wes:\n\nShit. Steve has never attended a project management meeting. We are\n\ntotally screwed.\n\nKirsten clears her throat. “First on our agenda is Phoenix. The news isn’t\n\ngood. This project went from yellow to red about four weeks ago, and it’s\n\nmy personal assessment that the deadline is in grave jeopardy.”\n\nShe continues in her professional voice, “To refresh your memory, last\n\nweek there were twelve tasks in the critical path of Phoenix Phase 1. Only\n\nthree of those tasks were completed.”\n\nThere is a collective groan in the room, and several people mutter to one\n\nanother. Steve turns to look at me. “Well?”\n\nI explain, “The critical resource in question is Brent, who has been one\n\nhundred percent utilized helping to recover from the payroll failure, which\n\nwe all know about. This was a totally unforeseen emergency but obviously\n\none that we had to handle. Everyone knows how important Phoenix is, and\n\nwe are doing everything we can to make sure Brent can stay focused.”\n\n“Thanks for that super creative explanation, Bill,” Sarah immediately\n\nresponds. “The real issue here is that your people don’t seem to grasp how\n\nimportant Phoenix is to the company. Our competition is killing us in the\n\nmarket. You’ve all seen and heard the commercials about their new\n\nservices. They’re beating us on innovation, both in the retail stores and\n\nonline. They’ve already lured away some of our biggest partners, and our\n\nsales force is starting to panic. I’m not the type to say, ‘I told you so,’ but\n\ntheir latest product announcement shows why we can’t be acting as if this is\n\njust business as usual.”\n\nShe continues, “See, Bill, in order for us to increase market share, we\n\nmust ship Phoenix. But for some reason, you and your team keep dragging\n\nyour feet. Maybe you’re not prioritizing correctly? Or maybe you’re just\n\nnot used to supporting a project this important?”\n\nDespite all my mental preparation, I feel my face get hot with anger.\n\nMaybe it was the condescending way she was parroting Steve to me. Or\n\nhow she wasn’t even looking at me while she was addressing me, instead\n\nlooking at Steve to see how he reacts. Or the way she basically called me\n\nout-of-touch and incompetent.\n\nEveryone is silent as I force myself to take a deep breath.\n\nMy anger dissipates. This is all just corporate theater. I don’t like it but\n\naccept it for what it is. I almost made the Marines my career when I was up\n\nfor promotion to staff sergeant. You don’t become a senior NCO in the\n\nMarines without being able to play politics.\n\n“Interesting,” I say to Sarah. “You tell me which is more important:\n\ngetting our factory employees paid or getting the Phoenix tasks done? Steve\n\ntold me to resolve the payroll failure. How would you have prioritized this\n\ndifferently than Steve?”\n\nAt my mention of Steve, Sarah’s expression changes. “Well, maybe if IT\n\ndidn’t cause the failure in the first place, you wouldn’t have blown your\n\ncommitments to us. I don’t think we can depend on you and your team.”\n\nI nod slowly, not taking the bait. “I look forward to any suggestions you\n\nhave to offer, Sarah.”\n\nShe looks at me, then at Steve. Apparently deciding there are no more\n\npoints to be gained here, she rolls her eyes. I see Wes shaking his head in\n\ndisbelief at this discussion, staying uncharacteristically quiet.\n\nSarah continues, “We’ve spent over $20 million on Phoenix, and we’re\n\nnearly two years late. We must get to market.” Looking over at Chris, she\n\nasks, “Given the delays from Bill’s group, when is the soonest we can go\n\nlive?”\n\nChris looks up from his papers. “I’ve looked into this since we talked\n\nlast week. If we expedite some things and if the virtualized environments\n\nfrom Bill’s team work as expected, we can go into production one week\n\nfrom Friday.”\n\nI gape at Chris. He just made up an arbitrary date to go into production,\n\nwith complete disregard for all the things we need to do before deployment.\n\nI have a sudden flashback. In the Marines, we had a ritual for all the\n\nsenior NCOs. We’d hang out with beers and watch Star Wars: Return of the\n\nJedi. Every time Admiral Ackbar would cry, “It’s a trap!” we’d all laugh\n\nuproariously, yelling for a replay.\n\nThis time, I’m not laughing.\n\n“Now just wait a goddamned minute here!” Wes interjects, pounding the\n\ntable. “What the hell are you trying to pull? We just found out two weeks\n\nago about the specifics of the Phoenix deployment. Your guys still haven’t\n\ntold us what sort of infrastructure we need, so we can’t even order the\n\nnecessary server and networking gear. And by the way, the vendors are\n\nalready quoting us three-week delivery times!”\n\nHe is now facing Chris, pointing at him angrily. “Oh, and I’ve heard that\n\nthe performance of your code is so shitty, we’re going to need the hottest,\n\nfastest gear out there. You’re supposed to support 250 transactions per\n\nsecond, and you’re barely doing even four! We’re going to need so much\n\nhardware that we’ll need another chassis to put it all in and probably have\n\nto pay a custom-manufacturing fee to get it in time. God knows what this\n\nwill do to the budget.”\n\nChris wants to respond, but Wes is relentless. “We still don’t have a\n\nconcrete specification of how the production and test systems should be\n\nconfigured. Oh, do you guys not need a test environment anymore? You\n\nhaven’t even done any real testing of your code yet, because that fell off the\n\nschedule, too!”\n\nMy heart lurches as all the implications sink in. I’ve seen this movie\n\nbefore. The plot is simple: First, you take an urgent date-driven project,\n\nwhere the shipment date cannot be delayed because of external\n\ncommitments made to Wall Street or customers. Then you add a bunch of\n\ndevelopers who use up all the time in the schedule, leaving no time for\n\ntesting or operations deployment. And because no one is willing to slip the\n\ndeployment date, everyone after Development has to take outrageous and\n\nunacceptable shortcuts to hit the date.\n\nThe results are never pretty. Usually, the software product is so unstable\n\nand unusable that even the people who were screaming for it end up saying\n\nthat it’s not worth shipping. And it’s always IT Operations who still has to\n\nstay up all night, rebooting servers hourly to compensate for crappy code,\n\ndoing whatever heroics are required to hide from the rest of the world just\n\nhow bad things really are.\n\n“Guys, I understand the desire to get Phoenix into production as quickly\n\nas possible,” I say to Steve and Chris as calmly as I can. “But based on\n\nwhat we’ve heard from Wes, I think it is incredibly premature to deploy. We\n\nstill don’t know what equipment we need to hit the performance objectives,\n\nnor have we done any capacity testing to confirm our guesses. It’s unlikely\n\nwe have adequate documentation to run this thing in production, let alone\n\nget everything monitored and backed up.”\n\nIn my most persuasive voice, I continue, “I want Phoenix in the market\n\nas badly as anyone else, but if the user experience is bad enough, we’ll end\n\nup driving our customers to the competition.”\n\nI turn to Chris. “You can’t just throw the pig over the wall to us, and\n\nthen high-five each other in the parking lot, congratulating yourselves on\n\nhow you made the deadline. Wes is telling us that the pig will probably\n\nbreak its leg, and it’ll be my guys who work all-nighters and weekends to\n\nkeep that pig alive.”\n\nChris replies hotly, “Don’t give me that bullshit about ‘throwing the pig\n\nover the wall.’ We invited your people to our architecture and planning\n\nmeetings, but I can count on one hand the number of times you guys\n\nactually showed up. We routinely have had to wait days or even weeks to\n\nget anything we need from you guys!”\n\nThen he just holds up his hands, as if everything is outside of his\n\ncontrol. “Look, I’d like more time, too. But from the very beginning, we all\n\nknew that this was a date-driven project. That was a business decision we\n\nall made.”\n\n“Exactly!” Sarah exclaims before I can respond. “This just shows how\n\nBill and his team lack the necessary sense of urgency. Perfection is the\n\nenemy of good. Bill, we simply do not have the luxury of time to polish this\n\nto whatever gold standard you’re proposing. We need to create positive cash\n\nflow, and we cannot do that without taking back market share. And to do\n\nthat, we need to deploy Phoenix.”\n\nShe looks over at Steve. “We understand risk, don’t we, Steve? You’ve\n\nbeen doing an absolutely amazing job selling this to analysts and even the\n\nguys on CNBC—I don’t think we want egg on our face by shipping even\n\nlater than we already are.”\n\nSteve nods his head and rubs his chin, rocking back and forth in his\n\nchair as he thinks. “Agreed,” he finally says, leaning forward. “We’ve made\n\ncommitments to our investors and analysts that we were going to launch\n\nPhoenix this quarter.”\n\nMy jaw drops. Sarah has blunted all my arguments, leading Steve down\n\na reckless, destructive path.\n\nExasperated, I say, “Does anyone think this is really odd? I’ve been in\n\nthis room when we discussed installing new water fountains in the front of\n\nevery store. We gave that team nine months to plan the rollout. Nine\n\nmonths! And all of us agreed that was reasonable.\n\n“Now we’re talking about Phoenix, which impacts thousands of point of\n\nsale systems, and all of the back-office order entry systems. This is at least\n\nten thousand times more complex than rolling out new water fountains,\n\nwith way more risk to the business. And you’re only giving us one week to\n\nplan and execute the rollout?”\n\nI throw my hands up, imploring Steve, “Doesn’t this seem a bit reckless\n\nand unfair?”\n\nKirsten nods, but Sarah says dismissively, “Bill, that’s a touching story\n\nbut we’re not discussing water fountains, we’re discussing Phoenix.\n\nBesides, I believe the decision has already been made.”\n\nSteve says, “Yes, it has. Thank you for sharing what you view as the\n\nrisks, Bill.” He turns to Sarah. “When is the launch date?”\n\nSarah replies quickly, “Marketing launch is next Saturday, September\n\n13. Phoenix will deploy at 5 p.m. the previous day.”\n\nSteve writes the date in the back of his notebook and says, “Good. Keep\n\nme posted on progress, and let me know if there’s anything I can do to\n\nhelp.”\n\nI look over at Wes, who mimes with his hands an airplane crashing into\n\nthe table in front of him and bursting into flames.\n\nIn the hallway, Wes says, “I thought that went pretty well, boss.”\n\nI’m not laughing. “What the hell happened in there? How did we get\n\ninto this position? Does anyone know what’s required from us to support\n\nthis launch?”\n\n“No one has a damned clue,” he says, shaking his head in disgust. “We\n\nhaven’t even agreed on how to do the handoff with Development. In the\n\npast, they’ve just pointed to a network folder and said, ‘Deploy that.’ There\n\nare newborn babies dropped off at church doorsteps with more operating\n\ninstructions than what they’re giving us.”\n\nI shake my head at his awful imagery, but he’s right. We’ve got a serious\n\nproblem here.\n\nHe continues, “We’re going to have to assemble a huge team, including\n\nChris’ guys, to figure out how we’re going to pull this off. We have\n\nproblems at every layer: networking, servers, databases, operating systems,\n\napplications, Layer 7 switching—the whole wad of crap. It’s going to be\n\nlate nights for all of us for the next nine days.”\n\nI nod unhappily. This type of all-hands effort is just another part of life\n\nin IT, but it makes me angry when we need to make some heroic, diving\n\ncatch because of someone else’s lack of planning.\n\nI say, “Get your team assembled, and ask Chris to assemble his\n\nrespective team as well. Stop trying to do this by e-mail and in the ticketing\n\nsystem. We need everyone in the same room.”\n\n“Speaking of commitments,” I say, “What was Chris referring to when\n\nhe said that our guys never showed up to the Phoenix architecture and\n\nplanning meetings? Is that true?”\n\nWes rolls his eyes in frustration. “Yeah, it’s true that his people would\n\ninvite us at the last minute. Seriously, who can clear their calendar on less\n\nthan a day’s notice?”\n\n“Although, in fairness,” he says, after a moment, “we did get ample\n\nnotice on a couple of the big planning meetings. And one of the most\n\ncritical people who needed to be there wasn’t able to make it, due to\n\nescalations. You can probably guess who that is…”\n\nI groan. “Brent?”\n\nWes nods, “Yep. He’s the guy we need at those meetings to tell those\n\ngoddamned developers how things work in the real world and what type of\n\nthings keep breaking in production. The irony, of course, is that he can’t tell\n\nthe developers, because he’s too busy repairing the things that are already\n\nbroken.”\n\nHe’s right. Unless we can break this cycle, we’ll stay in our terrible\n\ndownward spiral. Brent needs to work with developers to fix issues at the\n\nsource so we can stop fighting fires. But Brent can’t attend, because he’s\n\ntoo busy fighting fires.\n\nI say, “We need our best minds to prepare for this deployment, so make\n\nsure Brent is there.”\n\nWes looks sheepish for a moment. I ask him, “What?”\n\n“I think he’s working a network outage right now.” he replies.\n\n“Not anymore,” I say. “They’re going to have to fix it without him. If\n\nsomeone has a problem with that, send them to me.”\n\n“Okay, whatever you want, boss.” he says, shrugging his shoulders.\n\nAfter the project management meeting, I’m in no mood to talk to anyone. I\n\nsit at my desk and grumble when my laptop doesn’t wake up. The disk\n\ndrive light just keeps blinking. When nothing shows on the screen, I grab\n\nmy empty mug that I keep on my desk by the picture of Paige and my two\n\nsons and walk to the coffee machine in the corner.\n\nWhen I get back to my desk, a window on the screen tells me that it’s\n\ngoing to install some critical new updates. I sit down, click “OK” and watch\n\nthe status bar crawl across the screen. Suddenly, I see the dreaded “blue\n\nscreen of death.” My laptop is now completely locked up and unusable.\n\nIt happens again even after I reboot. I mutter in frustration, “You’ve got\n\nto be kidding me!”\n\nJust then, Ellen, my new assistant, pokes her head around the corner.\n\nHolding out her hand she says, “Good morning. Congratulations on the\n\npromotion, Bill!” Noticing my blue-screened laptop, she says\n\nsympathetically, “Ooh, that doesn’t look good.”\n\n“Umm, thanks.” I say, reaching out to shake her hand. “Yeah, about this\n\nlaptop, can you get a hold of someone in desktop support? There’s some\n\nserious crap headed our way from Phoenix, and I’m going to need it.”\n\n“No problem,” she says, nodding with a smile. “I’ll tell them our new VP\n\nis hopping mad, demanding that his laptop get fixed. Of all people, you\n\nneed a working computer, right?\n\n“You know,” she adds, “I’ve heard that a bunch of other people are\n\nhaving problems like this today. I’ll make sure you get to the top of the list.\n\nYou can’t afford to wait in line.”\n\nMore bricked laptops? This is surely evidence that the universe is out to\n\nget me today.\n\n“By the way, I need some help coordinating some emergency Phoenix\n\nmeetings. Has anyone granted you access to my calendar yet?” I ask.\n\nShe rolls her eyes. “No. That’s actually why I came down here. I wanted\n\nto see if you could print out your next couple of days. Obviously, that’s out\n\nof the question. I’ll have the desktop support person do that while he’s here.\n\nSometimes it takes weeks for the e-mail administrators to get around to\n\nstuff like this.”\n\nWeeks? That’s unacceptable. I quickly look at my watch and realize I’ll\n\nhave to tackle this later. I’m already late.\n\n“Do your best,” I say. “I’m off to Patty’s enterprise change management\n\nmeeting. Call me if you need anything, okay?”\n\nBeing ten minutes late to Patty’s meeting, I hurry into the room,\n\nexpecting to see either a bunch of people waiting for me impatiently or\n\nperhaps a meeting already underway.\n\nInstead, I see only Patty sitting at the conference table, typing away on\n\nher laptop.\n\n“Welcome to the CAB, Bill. I hope you can find an empty chair,” she\n\nsays.\n\n“Where is everybody?” I ask.\n\nI’m baffled. When I ran the midrange group, my team would never miss\n\nour change management meetings. It was where we coordinated and\n\norganized all our work to make sure we didn’t shoot ourselves in the foot.\n\n“I told you yesterday that change management around here is hit-or-\n\nmiss,” Patty says, sighing. “Some groups have their own local change-\n\nmanagement process, like yours. But most groups do nothing at all.\n\nYesterday’s outage is just proof that we need to have something at the\n\nenterprise level. Right now, the left hand rarely knows what the right hand\n\nis doing.”\n\n“So, what’s the problem?” I ask.\n\nShe purses her lip. “I don’t know. We sent a bunch of people to ITIL\n\ntraining, so they could get up to speed on all the best practices. We brought\n\nin some consultants, who helped us replace our ticketing system with an\n\nITIL-compliant change management tool. People were supposed to put\n\nchange requests into it, where it would get routed for approvals. But, even\n\nafter two years, all we have is a great process on paper that no one follows\n\nand a tool that no one uses. When I pester people to use them, all I get are\n\ncomplaints and excuses.”\n\nI nod. ITIL stands for IT Infrastructure Library, which documents many IT\n\nbest practices and processes, and the ITIL program has had a reputation of\n\nspending years merely walking in circles.\n\nI’m bothered that Wes isn’t here. I know he’s busy, but if he’s not here,\n\nwhy would any of his people bother to show up? Efforts like this must start\n\nand be continually maintained from the top.\n\n“Well, they can bring their complaints and excuses to me,” I say\n\nadamantly. “We’re rebooting the change management process. With my\n\ntotal support. Steve’s told me to make sure people can stay focused on\n\nPhoenix. Screwups like the SAN failure made us miss a Phoenix deliverable,\n\nand now we’re paying for it. If someone wants to skip a change\n\nmanagement meeting, they obviously are in need of some special\n\ncompassionate coaching. From me.”\n\nAt Patty’s puzzled expression at my Phoenix reference, I tell her about\n\nhow Wes and I spent our morning being run over by the bus. Sarah and\n\nChris were at the wheel, but Steve was in back, cheering them on to floor it.\n\n“Not good,” she says, disapprovingly. “They even ran over Kirsten,\n\nhuh?”\n\nI nod silently but refuse to say more. I always liked that phrase in Saving\n\nPrivate Ryan: “There’s a chain of command: gripes go up, not down.”\n\nInstead, I ask her to walk me through the current change process and the\n\nway it’s been automated in the tools. It all sounds good. But there’s only\n\none way to see if the process works.\n\nI say, “Schedule another CAB meeting for the same time Friday. I’ll send\n\nout an e-mail to all the CAB members letting them know that this is\n\nmandatory.”\n\nWhen I get back to my cubicle, Ellen is at my desk, bending over my laptop,\n\nwriting a note.\n\n“Everything working, I hope?” I ask.\n\nShe startles at the sound of my voice. “Oh, my God. You scared me,”\n\nshe says laughing. “Support left you a replacement laptop because they\n\ncouldn’t get your laptop to boot, even after a half hour of trying.”\n\nShe points at the far side of my desk, and I do a double take.\n\nMy replacement laptop appears to be almost ten years old—it’s twice as\n\nlarge as my old one and looks three times as heavy. The battery has been\n\ntaped on, and half the keyboard lettering is worn off from heavy use.\n\nFor a moment, I wonder if this is a practical joke.\n\nI sit down and bring up my e-mail, but everything is so slow that several\n\ntimes I thought it had locked up.\n\nEllen has a sympathetic expression on her face. “The support guy said\n\nthat this is all they have available today. Over two hundred people are\n\nhaving similar problems, and many aren’t getting replacements. Apparently,\n\npeople with your laptop model also have had their’s break because of some\n\nsecurity patch.”\n\nDamn. I forgot. It’s Patch Tuesday, when John and his team roll out all\n\ntheir security patches from our major vendors. Once again, John is causing\n\nhuge issues and disruptions for my team and me.\n\nI merely nod and thank her for the help. After she’s gone, I sit down and\n\ntype out an e-mail to all the CAB members, my keystrokes often taking ten\n\nseconds to show up on the screen.\n\nFrom: Bill Palmer\n\nTo: Wes Davis, Patty McKee, IT Operations Management\n\nDate: September 3, 2:43 PM\n\nPriority: Highest\n\nSubject: Mandatory CAB meeting Friday, 2 PM\n\nToday, I attended the weekly CAB meeting. I was extremely\n\ndisappointed that I was the only one there, besides Patty, especially\n\ngiven the totally avoidable, change-related failure yesterday.\n\nEffective immediately, managers (or their assigned delegates) are\n\nrequired to attend all scheduled CAB meetings and to perform their\n\nassigned duties. We are resurrecting the Parts Unlimited change\n\nmanagement process and it will be followed to the letter.\n\nAny person(s) caught circumventing change management will be\n\nsubject to disciplinary action.\n\nThere will be a mandatory CAB meeting Friday at 2 PM. See you\n\nthere.\n\nCall me if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nThanks for your support,\n\nBill\n\nI hit send, waiting fifteen seconds for the e-mail to finally leave my\n\noutbox. Almost immediately, my cell phone rings.\n\nIt’s Wes. I say, “I was just about to call you about the laptops. We’ve got\n\nto get replacements to our managers and employees so they can do their\n\njobs, you hear?”\n\n“Yeah, we’re on it. But I’m not calling about that. And I’m not calling\n\nabout Phoenix, either,” he says, sounding irritated. “Look, about your\n\nmemo on change management: I know you’re the boss, but you better know\n\nthat the last time we did one of these change management kumbayas, we\n\nran IT straight into the ground. No one, and I mean absolutely no one, could\n\nget a goddamned thing done. Patty insisted on having everyone take a\n\nnumber and wait for her pointy-heads to authorize and schedule our\n\nchanges. It was absolutely ridiculous and a total waste of time.”\n\nHe’s unstoppable: “That software application she made us use is a total\n\npiece of crap. It takes twenty minutes to fill out all the goddamned fields for\n\na simple five-minute change! I don’t know who designed the process, but I\n\nthink they assumed that we all get paid by the hour and want to talk about\n\ndoing work instead of actually doing work.\n\n“Eventually, the Networking and Server Team staged a rebellion,\n\nrefusing to use Patty’s tool,” he continues heatedly. “But John waved an\n\naudit finding around and went to Luke, our old CIO. And just like you did,\n\nLuke said that following policies was a condition of employment,\n\nthreatening to fire anybody who didn’t follow them.\n\n“My guys were spending half their time doing paperwork and sitting in\n\nthat damned CAB meeting,” he continues. “Luckily, the effort finally died,\n\nand John was too clueless to catch on that no one was actually going to the\n\nmeetings anymore. Even John hasn’t gone to one of those meetings in over\n\na year!”\n\nInteresting.\n\n“I hear you,” I say. “We can’t repeat that, but we also can’t have another\n\npayroll disaster. Wes, I need you there, and I need you to help create the\n\nsolution. Otherwise, you’re part of the problem. Can I count on you?”\n\nI hear him sigh loudly. “Yeah, sure. But you can also count on me\n\ncalling ‘bullshit’ if I see Patty trying to create some sort of bureaucracy that\n\nsucks out everybody’s will to live.”\n\nI sigh.\n\nBefore, I was merely worried that IT Operations was under attack by\n\nDevelopment, Information Security, Audit, and the business. Now, I’m\n\nstarting to realize that my primary managers seem to be at war with each\n\nother, as well.\n\nWhat will it take for us to all get along?\n\nChapter 5 • Thursday, September 4\n\nI wake up with a jolt when the alarm clock goes off at 6:15 a.m.. My jaw\n\nstill hurts from clenching it all night. The dismal prospects of the upcoming\n\nPhoenix launch were never far from my mind.\n\nAs usual, before climbing out of bed, I quickly scan my phone for any\n\nbad news. Usually, I would spend about ten minutes replying to e-mails—it\n\nalways feels good to lob a couple of balls off my side of the court.\n\nI see something that makes me bolt upright so abruptly that I wake up\n\nPaige. “Oh, my God. What, what?” she asks frantically, not fully awake.\n\n“It’s another e-mail from Steve. Hang on, darling…” I say to her, while I\n\nsquint to read it.\n\nFrom: Steve Masters\n\nTo: Bill Palmer\n\nCc: Nancy Mailer, Dick Landry\n\nDate: September 4, 6:05 AM\n\nPriority: Highest\n\nSubject: URGENT: SOX-404 IT Audit Findings Review\n\nBill, please look into this ASAP.

We discovered some very\n\nconcerning deficiencies that we need to discuss with you. Due to the\n\nseverity and urgency of the findings, we need to meet with IT this\n\nmorning.\n\nNancy\n\nIndeed, there’s a two-hour meeting scheduled for 8 a.m. on my calendar,\n\nset up by Nancy Mailer, Chief Audit Executive.\n\nHoly crap. She is incredibly smart and formidable. Years ago during the\n\nretail acquisition integration, I watched her grill a manager from the\n\nbusiness we were acquiring. He was presenting their financial performance,\n\nwhen she started a rapid-fire interrogation, like a cross between Columbo,\n\nMatlock, and Scarface.\n\nHe quickly broke, admitting that he was exaggerating his division’s\n\nperformance.\n\nRecalling that meeting, my armpits feel damp. I haven’t done anything\n\nwrong. But given the tone of the e-mail, she is clearly hot on the trail of\n\nsomething important, and Steve just threw me in her path.\n\nI’ve always run a very tight ship in my Midrange Technology group.\n\nThis kept Audit from interfering too much. Sure, there would still be a lot of\n\nquestions and documentation requests, requiring us to spend a few weeks\n\ncollecting data and preparing responses. Occasionally, they would find\n\nsomething, but we would quickly fix it.\n\nI like to think that we built a mutually respectful working relationship.\n\nHowever, this e-mail portends something more ominous.\n\nI look at my watch. The meeting is in ninety minutes, and I don’t have a\n\nclue about what she wants to talk about.\n\n“Shit!” I exclaim, as I jostle Paige’s shoulder. “Honey, can you drive the\n\nkids into school today? Something really bad just came up involving the\n\nChief Audit Executive and Steve. I need to make some phone calls and get\n\nto the office right away.”\n\nAnnoyed, she says, “For two years you’ve always taken the kids on\n\nThursdays! I have an early start today, too!”\n\n“I’m sorry, honey. This is really important. The CEO of the company\n\nasked me to handle this. Steve Masters. You know, the guy on TV and who\n\ngives the big speeches at the company holiday party? I can’t drop another\n\nball after a day like yesterday. And the newspaper headline the night before\n\nthat—”\n\nWithout a word, she storms down the stairs.\n\nWhen I finally find the conference room for the 8 a.m. meeting, I\n\nimmediately notice how silent it is, devoid of the usual small talk that fills\n\nthe time while attendees trickle in.\n\nNancy sits at the head of the table, with four other people sitting around\n\nher. Sitting next to her is John along with his ever-present, black three-ring\n\nbinder. As always, I’m surprised by how young he is. He’s probably in his\n\nmid-thirties with thick, curly black hair.\n\nJohn has a haggard look about him, and like many college students, has\n\ncontinually gained weight in the three years he’s been here at Parts\n\nUnlimited. Most likely from all the stress associated with his failing moral\n\ncrusade.\n\nJohn actually reminds me more of Brent than anyone else in the room.\n\nHowever, unlike Brent who normally wears a Linux T-shirt, John wears a\n\nstarched, collared shirt that’s slightly too large.\n\nWes is conspicuously underdressed compared to everyone in the room,\n\nbut he obviously doesn’t care. The last person in the room is a young man\n\nwho I don’t recognize, presumably the IT auditor.\n\nNancy begins, “We have just concluded our Q3 internal audit in\n\npreparation for the upcoming external SOX-404 audits. We have a grave\n\nsituation. Tim, our IT auditor, found an eye-opening number of IT control\n\nissues. Worse, many are repeat findings going into the third year. Left\n\nunresolved, these findings may force us to conclude that the company no\n\nlonger has sufficient controls to assert the accuracy of its financial\n\nstatements. This could result in an adverse footnote from the external\n\nauditors in the company 10-K filings with the US Securities and Exchange\n\nCommission.\n\n“Although these are only preliminary findings, due to the gravity of the\n\nsituation, I have already verbally informed the audit committee.”\n\nI blanch. Although I don’t understand all the audit jargon, I know\n\nenough that this could ruin Dick’s day and mean potentially more bad front-\n\npage news.\n\nSatisfied that I understand the severity of the situation, Nancy nods.\n\n“Tim, please walk us through your conclusions.”\n\nHe takes out a huge stack of stapled papers, handing one out to everyone\n\nassembled. “We have just concluded our audit of the IT general controls at\n\nParts Unlimited for all of the critical financial systems. It took a team of\n\nfour people over eight weeks to create this consolidated report.”\n\nHoly crap. I lift the two-inch thick stack of papers in my hand. Where\n\ndid they find a stapler this big?\n\nIt’s a printed Excel spreadsheet, with twenty rows per page in tiny eight-\n\npoint type. The last page is numbered page 189. “There must be a thousand\n\nissues here!” I say in disbelief.\n\n“Unfortunately, yes,” he responds, not entirely able to hide his smug\n\nsatisfaction. “We found 952 IT general control deficiencies, of which sixteen\n\nare significant deficiencies and two are potential material weaknesses.\n\nObviously, we’re very alarmed. Given how soon the external audit starts,\n\nwe need your remediation plan as soon as possible.”\n\nWes is hunched over the table, one hand on his forehead, the other hand\n\nflipping through page after page. “What kind of horseshit is this?”\n\nHe holds up one page. “‘Issue 127. Insecure Windows operating system\n\nMAX_SYN_COOKIE setting’? Is this a joke? In case you haven’t heard, we’ve\n\ngot a real business to run. Sorry if that interferes with this full-time audit\n\nemployment racket you’ve got going on here.”\n\nTrust Wes to say what people are thinking but are too smart to actually\n\nsay aloud.\n\nNancy responds gravely, “Unfortunately, at this point, the phase of\n\ncontrol review and testing is over. What we require from you now is the\n\n‘management response letter.’ You need to investigate each of these\n\nfindings, confirm them, and then create a remediation plan. We’ll review it\n\nand then present to the audit committee and the board of directors.\n\n“Normally, you would have months to prepare your response letter and\n\nexecute your remediation plan,” she continues, suddenly looking\n\napologetic. “Unfortunately, the way the audit testing calendar worked out,\n\nwe only have three weeks until the external auditors arrive. That’s\n\nregrettable. We’ll make sure to give IT more time in the next audit cycle.\n\nBut this time around, we require your response by…”\n\nShe looks at her calendar. “One week from Monday, at the very latest.\n\nDo you think you can make it?”\n\nOh, shit.\n\nThat’s just six working days away. We’ll need half that time just to read\n\nthe entire document.\n\nOur auditors, who I’ve long believed are a force for justice and\n\nobjectivity, are crapping on me, too?\n\nI pick up the huge stack of papers again and look at a couple of random\n\npages. There are many entries like Wes read, but others have references to\n\ninadequate security settings, presence of ghost login accounts, change\n\ncontrol issues, and segregation of duties issues.\n\nJohn flips his three-ring binder open and says officiously, “Bill, I\n\nbrought up many of the same issues with Wes and your predecessor. They\n\nconvinced the CIO to sign a management waiver, stating that he accepted the\n\nrisk, and do nothing. Given that some of these are now repeat audit\n\nfindings, I don’t think we’ll be able to talk our way out of it this time.”\n\nHe turns to Nancy. “During the previous management regime, IT\n\ncontrols clearly weren’t a priority, but now that all the security chickens are\n\ncoming home to roost, I’m sure Bill will be more prudent.”\n\nWes looks at John with contempt. I can’t believe John is grandstanding\n\nin front of the auditors. It’s times like this that make me wonder whose side\n\nhe’s really on.\n\nOblivious to Wes and me, John says to Nancy, “My department has been\n\nremediating some other controls, which I think we should be given credit\n\nfor. For starters, we’ve completed the tokenization of the PII on our critical\n\nfinancial systems, so at least we dodged that bullet. That finding is now\n\nclosed.”\n\nNancy says dryly, “Interesting. The presence of PII is not in the scope of\n\nthe SOX-404 audit, so from that perspective, focusing on the IT general\n\ncontrols might have been a better use of time.”\n\nWait. John’s urgent tokenization change was for nothing?\n\nIf that’s true, John and I need to talk. Later.\n\nI say slowly, “Nancy, I genuinely don’t know what we can get to you by\n\nFriday. We’re buried in recovery work and are scrambling to support the\n\nupcoming Phoenix rollout. Which of these findings are the most important\n\nfor us to respond to?”\n\nNancy nods to Tim, who says, “Certainly. The first issue is the potential\n\nmaterial weakness, which is outlined on page seven. This finding states that\n\nan unauthorized or untested change to an application supporting financial\n\nreporting could have been put into production. This could potentially result\n\nin an undetected material error, due to fraud or otherwise. Management\n\ndoes not have any control that would prevent or detect such a change.\n\n“Furthermore, your group was also unable to produce any change\n\nmanagement meeting minutes, which is supposed to meet weekly,\n\naccording to your policy.”\n\nI try not wince visibly, recalling that no one even showed up at the CAB\n\nmeeting yesterday, and during the payroll incident, we were so oblivious to\n\nJohn’s tokenization change that we ended up bricking the SAN.\n\nIf we were clueless about those changes, I sincerely doubt that we’d\n\nnotice if someone disabled a control that would enable a minor, say, $100\n\nmillion fraudulent transaction.\n\n“Really? That’s unbelievable! I’ll look into that.” I say with what I hope\n\nis the right amount of surprise and moral outrage. After I pretend to take\n\ndetailed notes on my clipboard, circling and underlining random words, I\n\nnod, prompting Tim to continue.\n\n“Next, we found numerous instances where developers have\n\nadministrative access to production applications and databases. This\n\nviolates the required segregation of duty required to prevent risk for fraud.”\n\nI look over to John. “Really? You don’t say. Developers making changes\n\nto an application without an approved change order? That certainly sounds\n\nlike a security risk. What would happen if someone coerced a developer,\n\nsay Max, into doing something unauthorized? We’ve go to do something\n\nabout that, right, John?”\n\nJohn turns bright red, but says politely, “Yes, of course. I agree and\n\nwould be happy to help.”\n\nTim says, “Good. Let’s move onto the sixteen significant deficiencies.”\n\nA half hour later, Tim is still droning on. I stare glumly at the huge stack\n\nof findings. Most of these issues are just like the huge, useless reports we\n\nget from Information Security, which is another reason why John has such a\n\nbad reputation.\n\nIt’s the never-ending hamster wheel of pain: Information Security fills\n\nup people’s inboxes with never-ending lists of critical security remediation\n\nwork, quarter after quarter.\n\nWhen Tim finally finishes, John volunteers, “We must get these\n\nvulnerable systems patched. My team has a lot of experience patching\n\nsystems, if you require assistance. These audit findings are an awesome\n\nopportunity to close some big security holes.”\n\n“Look, both of you guys have no idea what you’re asking for!” Wes says\n\nto John and Tim, clearly exasperated. “Some of the servers that those\n\nmanufacturing ERP systems run on are over twenty years old. Half the\n\ncompany will grind to a halt if they go down, and the vendor went out of\n\nbusiness decades ago! These things are so fragile that if you even look at\n\nthem at the wrong time of day, they’ll crash and require all sorts of voodoo\n\nto get them to successfully reboot. They’ll never survive the changes you’re\n\nproposing!”\n\nHe leans over the table, putting his finger in John’s face. “You want to\n\npatch it yourself, fine. But I want a signed piece of paper from you saying\n\nthat if you push the button and the entire business grinds to a halt, you’ll fly\n\naround and grovel to all the plant managers, explaining to them why they\n\ndidn’t hit their production targets. Deal?”\n\nMy eyes widen with amazement when John actually leans forward into\n\nWes’ finger and says angrily, “Oh, yeah? How about when we’re on the\n\nfront page of the news because we lost consumer data that we’re\n\nresponsible for protecting? You’ll personally apologize to the thousands or\n\nmillions of families whose data are now being sold by the Russian Mafia?”\n\nI say, “Settle down, everyone. We all want to do what’s right for the\n\ncompany. The trick is figuring out what we have time to do and what\n\nsystems can actually be patched.”\n\nI look at the stack of papers. Wes, Patty, and I can assign people the task\n\nof investigating each issue, but who will actually do the work? We’re\n\nalready buried with Phoenix, and I fear that this new massive project might\n\nbe the straw that breaks the camel’s back.\n\nI say to Nancy, “I’ll get with my team right away, and we’ll come up\n\nwith a plan. I can’t promise you that we’ll have our response letter\n\ncompleted by then, but I can promise you that we’ll get you everything we\n\ncan. Will that be adequate?”\n\n“Quite so,” Nancy says amicably. “Going through the preliminary audit\n\nfindings and identifying next steps were the only objectives for this\n\nmeeting.”\n\nAs the meeting adjourns, I ask Wes to stay behind.\n\nNoticing this, John remains behind, as well. “This is a disaster. All my\n\nobjectives and bonuses are tied to getting a clean compliance report for the\n\nSOX-404 and PCI audits. I’m going to fail because you Ops guys can’t get\n\nyour shit together!”\n\n“Join the club,” I say.\n\nTo get him off my back, I say, “Sarah and Steve decided to move up the\n\nPhoenix deployment date to next Friday. They want to skip all the security\n\nreviews. You probably should talk to Chris and Sarah right away.”\n\nPredictably, John swears and storms out, slamming the door behind him.\n\nExhausted, I lean back in my chair and say to Wes, “This is just not our\n\nweek.”\n\nWes laughs humorlessly. “I told you that the pace of things around here\n\nwould make your head explode.”\n\nI gesture at the audit findings. “We’re supposed to protect all our key\n\nresources for Phoenix, but that’s sucking in everybody. We don’t have a\n\nbunch of people just sitting on the bench we can throw at the audit findings,\n\nright?”\n\nWes shakes his head, his face uncharacteristically pinched with tension.\n\nHe flips through his stack of papers again. “We’re definitely going to\n\nneed to bring the technology leads into this. But as you said, they’re already\n\nassigned to the Phoenix team. Should we reassign them here?”\n\nI honestly don’t know. Wes stares at one of the pages for a moment. “By\n\nthe way, I think a bunch of these will require Brent.”\n\n“Oh, for chrissakes.” I mutter. “Brent. Brent, Brent, Brent! Can’t we do\n\nanything without him? Look at us! We’re trying to have a management\n\ndiscussion about commitments and resources, and all we do is talk about\n\none guy! I don’t care how talented he is. If you’re telling me that our\n\norganization can’t do anything without him, we’ve got a big problem.”\n\nWes shrugs, slightly embarrassed. “He’s undoubtedly one of our best\n\nguys. He’s really smart, and he knows a lot about almost everything we\n\nhave in this shop. He’s one of the few people who really understand how all\n\nthe applications talk together at an enterprise level. Heck, the guy may\n\nknow more about how this company works than I do.”\n\n“You’re a senior manager. This should be as unacceptable to you as it is\n\nto me!” I say firmly. “How many more Brents do you need? One, ten, or a\n\nhundred? I’m going to need Steve to prioritize all this work. What I need\n\nfrom you is what resources we need. If I ask Steve for more resources, I\n\ndon’t want to have to crawl back, begging for more later.”\n\nHe rolls his eyes. “Look, I’ll tell you right now what’s going to happen.\n\nWe’ll go to management and present our case. Not only will they say no,\n\nthey’ll cut our budget by another five percent. That’s what they’ve done for\n\nthe past five years. In the meantime, everyone will continue to want\n\neverything at the same time, and keep adding to our list of things to do.”\n\nExasperated, he continues, “And just so you know, I have tried to hire\n\nmore Brents. Because I never got the budget, I eliminated a bunch of\n\npositions just so I could hire four more very senior engineers at the same\n\nlevel of experience as Brent. And you know what happened?”\n\nI merely raise my eyebrows.\n\nWes says, “Half quit within a year, and I’m not getting anywhere near\n\nthe productivity I need from the ones who stayed. Although I don’t have\n\ndata to prove it, I’m guessing Brent is even more behind than ever. He\n\ncomplains that he had to spend a bunch of time training and helping the\n\nnew guys, and is now stretched thinner than ever. And he’s still in the\n\nmiddle of everything.”\n\nI respond, “You said that people ‘add stuff to our list.’ What does the list\n\nlook like right now? Where can I get a copy? Who owns the list?”\n\nWes replies slowly, “Well, there are the business projects and the various\n\nIT infrastructure projects. But a lot of the commitments just aren’t written\n\ndown.”\n\n“How many business projects? How many infrastructure projects?” I\n\nask.\n\nWes shakes his head. “I don’t know offhand. I can get the list of\n\nbusiness projects from Kirsten, but I’m not sure if anyone knows the answer\n\nto your second question. Those don’t go through the Project Management\n\nOffice.”\n\nI have a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. How can we manage\n\nproduction if we don’t know what the demand, priorities, status of work in\n\nprocess, and resource availability are? Suddenly, I’m kicking myself that I\n\ndidn’t ask these questions on my first day.\n\nFinally, I’m thinking like a manager.\n\nI call Patty. “Wes and I just got hammered by audit and they need a\n\nresponse one week from Monday. I need your help to figure what all our\n\nwork commitments are, so I can have an intelligent discussion with Steve\n\nabout resourcing. Can you talk?”\n\nShe says, “That’s right up my alley. Come on over.”\n\nAfter Wes briefs Patty on the implications of the mammoth audit report\n\nthat he thumped down on the table, she whistles.\n\n“You know, I really wish you were at that meeting with the auditors,” I\n\nsay. “Most of the biggest issues were around the absence of a functional\n\nchange management process. I think you could end up being the auditors’\n\nbest friend.”\n\n“Auditors have friends?” she laughs.\n\n“I need you to help Wes estimate the work to fix the audit findings by\n\nMonday,” I say. “But right now, let’s talk about a higher level issue. I’m\n\ntrying to get the list of what all our commitments to the organization are.\n\nHow big is that list and how do things get on it?”\n\nAfter hearing what Wes told me, Patty replies, “Wes is right. Kirsten\n\nowns the official business project list, almost all of which have something\n\nthat we’re on the hook for. We have our own IT Operations projects, which\n\nare typically managed by the technology budget owner—there is no\n\ncentralized list of those projects.”\n\nPatty continues, “We also have all the calls going into the service desk,\n\nwhether it’s requests for something new or asking to fix something. But that\n\nlist will be incomplete, too, because so many people in the business just go\n\nto their favorite IT person. All that work is completely off the books.”\n\nI ask slowly, “So, you’re saying that we have no idea what the list of our\n\ncommitments is? Really?”\n\nWes says defensively, “Until now, no one ever asked. We’ve always\n\nhired smart people and tasked them with certain areas of responsibility.\n\nWe’ve never had to manage things beyond that.”\n\n“Well, we need to start. We can’t make new commitments to other\n\npeople when we don’t even know what our commitments are now!” I say.\n\n“At the very least, get me the work estimate to fix the audit findings. Then,\n\nfor each of those resources, tell me what their other commitments are that\n\nwe’re going to be pulling them off of.”\n\nThinking for a moment, I add, “For that matter, do the same thing for\n\nevery person assigned to Phoenix. I’m guessing we’re overloaded, so I want\n\nto know by how much. I want to proactively tell people whose projects\n\nhave been bumped, so they’re not surprised when we don’t deliver what we\n\npromised.”\n\nBoth Wes and Patty look surprised. Wes speaks up first, “But…but we’d\n\nhave to talk with almost everyone! Patty may have fun grilling people on\n\nwhat changes they’re making, but we can’t go around wasting the time of\n\nour best people. They’ve got real work to do!”\n\n“Yes, I know they have real work to do,” I say adamantly. “I merely\n\nwant a one-line description about what all that work is and how long they\n\nthink it will take!”\n\nRealizing how this might come across, I add, “Make sure you tell people\n\nthat we’re doing this so we can get more resources. I don’t want anyone\n\nthinking that we’re outsourcing or firing anyone, okay?”\n\nPatty nods. “We should have done this a long time ago. We bump up the\n\npriorities of things all the time, but we never really know what just got\n\nbumped down. That is, until someone screams at us, demanding to know\n\nwhy we haven’t delivered something.”\n\nShe types on her laptop. “You just want a list of organizational\n\ncommitments for our key resources, with a one-liner on what they’re\n\nworking on and how long it will take. We’ll start with all Phoenix and audit\n\nremediation resources first, but will eventually cover the entire IT\n\nOperations organization. Do I have it right?”\n\nI smile, genuinely happy that Patty has framed it so succinctly. I know\n\nshe’s going to do a great job. “Exactly. Bonus points if you and Wes can\n\ndetermine which resources are most overutilized and how many new\n\nresources we need. That would be the basis of an ask to Steve for more\n\nstaffing.”\n\nPatty says to Wes, “This should be pretty straightforward. We can put\n\ntogether fifteen-minute interviews, pull data from our service desk and\n\nticketing system, get Kirsten’s project list…”\n\nSurprisingly, Wes agrees, adding, “We could also look in our budgeting\n\ntools to see how we’ve coded personnel and hardware requests.”\n\nI stand up. “Great thinking, guys. Get a meeting set up for us to go over\n\nwhat you find, no later than Friday. I want to have a meeting with Steve on\n\nMonday, armed with some real data.”\n\nShe gives me the thumbs-up. Now we’re getting somewhere.\n\nChapter 6 • Friday, September 5\n\nIn another one of the endless Phoenix status meetings, I realize that the\n\ndevelopers are even more behind than we feared. As Wes had predicted,\n\nmore and more work is being deferred to the next release, including almost\n\nall of the testing.\n\nThis means that we’ll be the ones finding the problems when they blow\n\nup in production, instead of the Quality Assurance (QA) Department.\n\nGreat.\n\nDuring a lull in the discussion, I look down at my phone and see an e-\n\nmail from Patty. She wants to meet about resourcing, promising some eye-\n\nopening surprises.\n\nI open the attached spreadsheet, seeing an encouraging level of detail,\n\nbut on my minuscule phone screen, I can’t make heads or tails of it. I reply\n\nto Patty that I’m on the way and ask her to have Wes meet me there.\n\nWhen I arrive, I’m surprised to see that Wes has set up a projector,\n\ndisplaying a spreadsheet on the wall. I’m excited that we’re meeting to\n\nanalyze the situation, instead of just reacting to the daily fires.\n\nI grab a seat. “Okay, whatcha got for me?”\n\nWes starts. “Patty did a great job putting this together. What we found\n\nwas—well, it was interesting.”\n\nPatty explains, “We did our interviews, collected the data, and then did\n\nour analysis. Right now, these numbers are only for our key resources.\n\nWe’re already seeing something troubling.”",

      "content": "She points at a row in the spreadsheet. “First, we have a lot of projects.\n\nKirsten says she’s officially managing about thirty-five major business\n\nprojects, each of which we have commitments to. Internal to IT Operations,\n\nwe’ve already identified over seventy projects, and that number keeps\n\ngrowing with each person we interview.”\n\n“Wait,” I say, genuinely startled, sitting upright in my chair. “We have\n\n150 IT Operations people, right? If you’ve already found over 105 projects,\n\nthat’s 1.5 people per project. Doesn’t that seem like a lot to you?”\n\nWes replies, “Totally. And we know that the project count is low. So by\n\nthe end, it’ll probably be more like one person per project. That’s insane.”\n\nI ask, “How big are these internal projects?”\n\nWes switches tabs on the spreadsheet, showing the list of projects\n\nthey’ve inventoried, along with the estimated number of man-weeks.\n\n“Consolidate and upgrade e-mail server,” “Upgrade thirty-five instances of\n\nOracle databases,” “Install supported Lemming database server,”\n\n“Virtualize and migrate primary business applications,” and so on.\n\nI groan. While some projects are small, most seem like major\n\nundertakings, estimated at three man-years or more.\n\nWhen Patty sees the expression on my face, she says, “That was my\n\nreaction, too. We’re on the hook for a huge number of projects. So, let’s\n\nlook at what our capacity is. This is a little harder, since we can’t just assign\n\nrandom people to any given project.”\n\nShe continues, “When we looked at who was assigned to each project\n\nand what their other commitments and availability were, here’s what we\n\nfound.”\n\nWhen Wes flips to another spreadsheet tab, my heart drops.\n\n“Grim, huh?” says Wes. “Most of our resources are going to Phoenix.\n\nAnd look at the next line: Compliance is the next largest project. And even\n\nif we only worked on compliance, it would consume most of our key\n\nresources for an entire year! And that includes Brent, by the way.”\n\nIncredulous, I say, “You’re kidding. If we put all our projects on hold\n\nexcept for the audit findings, our key resources would be tied up for an\n\nentire year?”\n\n“Yep,” Patty says, nodding. “It’s hard to believe, but it just shows you\n\nhow much work is in that stack of audit findings.”\n\nI look down at the table, speechless.\n\nIf someone had shown me these figures during my first conversation\n\nwith Steve, I would have run from the room, screaming like a little boy.\n\nIt’s not too late, I think, smiling at the image.\n\nWith practiced calm, I say, “Okay, knowing is always better than not\n\nknowing. Keep going.”\n\nWes looks back at the spreadsheet. “The third largest item is incident\n\nand break-fix work. Right now, it’s probably consuming seventy-five\n\npercent of our staff’s time. And because these often involve critical business\n\nsystems, incidents will take priority over everything else, including Phoenix\n\nand fixing audit findings.\n\n“By the way, did you know that yesterday, when we were talking with\n\nBrent, we had to reschedule the interview twice because he had to go help\n\nfix an outage? So there we were interrupting him from Phoenix work, only\n\nto be interrupted by an outage!” he says, laughing.\n\nI start to laugh, but then stop abruptly. “Wait. What outage? Why didn’t\n\nI hear about it? We can’t keep running our organization like this!”\n\n“Well, it was another SAN issue, but nothing critical,” Wes replies. “A\n\ndrive went bad a couple of months ago, so the SAN was running with no\n\nredundancy. When another drive failed, the entire volume went down. Brent\n\nhad to help restore some of the databases when we got the SAN back up.”\n\nExasperated, I shout, “Goddamnit, Wes. That was completely\n\npreventable! Get one of your junior guys to look at the logs every day for\n\ndrive failures. Maybe even have him visually inspect the drives and count\n\nall the goddamned blinking lights. It’s called preventive maintenance for a\n\nreason! We need Brent on Phoenix, not piddly shit like this!”\n\nWes says defensively, “Hey, it’s actually a little more complicated than\n\nthat. We put in the order for replacement drives, but they’ve been stuck in\n\nProcurement for weeks. We had to get one of our vendors to give it to us on\n\ncredit. This wasn’t our fault.”\n\nI lose my temper. “Wes, listen to me. I DON’T CARE! I don’t care about\n\ngoddamned Procurement. I don’t care how nice your goddamned vendors\n\nare. I need you to do your damned job, and make sure this doesn’t happen\n\nagain!”\n\nI take a deep breath. I realize my frustration is not because of the drive\n\nfailure, but because we’re continually unable to stay focused on the things\n\nthat matter most to the company.\n\n“Look, let’s put this aside for now,” I say, looking back at Wes. “I’m\n\nserious about getting someone to look at that SAN daily, though. Set up a\n\nmeeting sometime next week for you, me, and Patty to get to the bottom of\n\nthese outages. We’ve got to figure out how to bring down the amount of\n\nbreak-fix work so we can get project work done. If we can’t get Phoenix\n\nwork done, it’s jeopardizing the company.”\n\n“Yeah, I got it. I’ll try to get it in before the Phoenix rollout.” Wes says,\n\nnodding sullenly. “And I’ll get on that SAN issue this afternoon.”\n\n“Okay, back to the spreadsheet,” I say.\n\nPatty observes glumly, “You’re right. The one consistent theme in the\n\ninterviews was that everyone struggles to get their project work done. Even\n\nwhen they do have time, they struggle to prioritize all their commitments.\n\nPeople in the business constantly ask our staff to do things for them.\n\nEspecially Marketing.”\n\n“Sarah?” I ask.\n\n“Sure, but it’s not only her,” she replies. “Practically every executive in\n\nthe company is guilty of going directly to their favorite IT person, either\n\nasking a favor or pressuring them to get something done.”\n\n“How do we change the game here and get resourced to do all these\n\nprojects properly?” I ask. “What should we be asking Steve for?”\n\nWes scrolls down his spreadsheet. “Based on our rough numbers, we’ll\n\nprobably need to hire seven people: three database administrators, two\n\nserver engineers, one network engineer, and one virtualization engineer. Of\n\ncourse, you know that it’ll take time to find these people and then another\n\nsix to twelve months before they’re fully productive.”\n\nOf course, I knew that new hires aren’t productive right away. But it was\n\nstill dispiriting to hear Wes point out that real help was still a long way off,\n\neven if Steve approved the headcount.\n\nLater that day, as I’m walking to our second CAB meeting, I feel hopeful. If\n\nwe can get our old change process going, we might be able to quickly\n\nresolve one of the largest audit issues and get some operational wins, as\n\nwell.\n\nI’m also pleased at how well Patty and Wes are working together.\n\nAs I near the conference room, I hear loud voices arguing.\n\n“—then Patty got that engineer fired for doing his job. He was one of\n\nour best networking people. That wasn’t your call to make!”\n\nNo mistake. That’s Wes hollering. Then I hear Patty reply heatedly,\n\n“What? You signed off on that termination! Why is this suddenly my fault?”\n\nI knew it was too good to be true.\n\nI then hear John say, “That was the right call. We’re going into our third\n\nyear of a repeat audit finding around change controls. That goes in front of\n\nthe audit committee. Next time around, it probably won’t be just an\n\nengineer getting fired, if you get my drift.”\n\nWait. Who invited John to this meeting?\n\nBefore John can make things any worse, I quickly step through the door\n\nand say cheerfully, “Good afternoon, everyone! Are we ready to review\n\nsome changes?”\n\nFourteen people turn to look at me. Most of the technical leads from the\n\nvarious groups are sitting at the table. Wes is standing up behind his chair,\n\nfuming, while Patty is standing in the front of the room, arms crossed.\n\nJohn sits in the back of the room, with his three-ring binder open, very\n\nmuch an unwanted guest.\n\nUsing both hands, I set down my antique laptop. It hits the table with a\n\nthud and a clatter as the battery falls off, the tape no longer holding it in\n\nplace, and then I hear a scratching sound as the disk drive spins down.\n\nWes’ angry expression disappears momentarily. “Wow, boss, nice gear.\n\nWhat is that, a Kaypro II? I haven’t seen one of those in about thirty years.\n\nLet me know if you need an 8-inch floppy to load CP/M on it—I’ve got one\n\nin my attic at home.”\n\nTwo of the engineers snicker and point. I smile briefly at Wes, grateful\n\nfor the comic relief.\n\nRemaining standing, I say to everyone, “Let me tell you why I\n\nassembled all of you here. Given the urgency of Phoenix, you can bet your\n\nass that I wouldn’t waste your time if I didn’t think this was important.”\n\nI continue, “First, the events that led to the SAN and payroll failure on\n\nTuesday must not happen again. What started off as a medium-sized payroll\n\nfailure snowballed into a massive friendly-fire SAN incident. Why? Because\n\nwe are not talking to one another about what changes we’re planning or\n\nimplementing. This is not acceptable.”\n\n“Second, John is right. We spent yesterday morning with our auditors,\n\ndiscussing a bunch of deficiencies they found,” I continue. “Dick Landry is\n\nalready crapping bricks because it could impact our quarterly financial\n\nstatements. We need to tighten up our change controls, and as managers and\n\ntechnical leads, we must figure out how we can create a sustainable process\n\nthat will prevent friendly-fire incidents and get the auditors off our back,\n\nwhile still being able to get work done. We are not leaving this room until\n\nwe’ve created a plan to get there. Understood?”\n\nWhen I’m satisfied that everyone has been properly cowed, I open it up\n\nfor discussion. “So what’s preventing us from getting there?”\n\nOne of the technical leads quickly says, “I’ll start. That change\n\nmanagement tool is impossible to use. There’s a million mandatory fields\n\nand most of the time, the drop down boxes for the ‘applications affected’\n\ndon’t even have what I need. It’s why I’ve stopped even putting in change\n\nrequests.”\n\nAnother lead hollers out, “He’s not kidding. To follow Patty’s rules, I\n\nhave to manually type in hundreds of server names in one of the text boxes.\n\nMost of the time, there’s not enough room in the field! A hundred server\n\nnames are supposed to fit in a sixty-four-character text box? What idiot\n\nbuilt that form?”\n\nAgain, more unkind laughter.\n\nPatty is bright red. She shouts, “We need to use drop-down boxes so we\n\ncan maintain data integrity! And I’d love to keep the application list up-to-\n\ndate, but I don’t have the resources. Who’s going to keep the application\n\ncatalog and change management database current? You think it just\n\nmagically updates itself?”\n\n“It’s not just the tool, Patty. It’s the entire damned process,” Wes asserts.\n\n“When my guys put in change requests, they have to wait a lifetime to get\n\napprovals, let alone get on the schedule. We have the business breathing\n\ndown our neck to get crap done. We can’t wait for you to hem and haw,\n\ncomplaining that we didn’t fill out the form right.”\n\nPatty snaps, “That’s crap, and you know it. Your people routinely break\n\nthe rules. Like, say, when everyone marks all their change requests as an\n\n‘urgent’ or ‘emergency change’. That field is only for actual emergencies!”\n\nWes retorts, “We have to do that, because marking them urgent is the\n\nonly way to get your team to look at it! Who can wait three weeks for an\n\napproval?”\n\nOne of the lead engineers suggests, “Maybe we make another field\n\ncalled ‘extremely urgent?’”\n\nI wait until the uproar quiets down. At this rate, we’re getting nowhere\n\nfast. Thinking furiously, I finally say, “Let’s take a ten-minute break.”\n\nWhen we reconvene the meeting, I say, “We are not leaving this meeting\n\nwithout a list of authorized and scheduled changes that we’re implementing\n\nin the next thirty days.\n\n“As you can see, my assistant has brought in a pile of blank index cards.\n\nI want each group to write down every change they’re planning, one change\n\nper index card. I want three pieces of information: who is planning the\n\nchange, the system being changed, and a one-sentence summary.\n\n“I’ve drawn a calendar on the whiteboard where we will eventually post\n\napproved changes according to their scheduled implementation,” I continue.\n\n“Those are the rules. Short and simple.”\n\nWes picks up a pack of cards, looking at them dubiously. “Really? Paper\n\ncards, in this day and age? How about we use that laptop of yours, which\n\nprobably even predates paper?”\n\nEveryone laughs, but not Patty. She looks angry, obviously not pleased\n\nwith the direction things are going.\n\n“This isn’t like any change management process I’ve ever seen,” John\n\nsays. “But I’ll put my changes on the board, like the upcoming firewall\n\nupdates and monitoring changes that’re scheduled for the next couple of\n\ndays.”\n\nSurprisingly, John’s willingness to jump in inspires others, who begin\n\nwriting their planned changes on their cards.\n\nFinally, Wes says, “Okay, let’s try it. Anything is better than using that\n\ndamned change management tool.”\n\nOne of the leads holds up a handful of cards. “I’m done with all the\n\ndatabase changes we’re planning to make.”\n\nWhen I nod for him to proceed, he quickly reads one of the cards:\n\n“Execute the vendor-recommended database maintenance script on Octave\n\nserver XZ577 to fix retail store POS performance issues. This affects the\n\norder entry database and applications. We’d like to do this next Friday\n\nevening at 8:30 p.m.”\n\nI nod, pleased with the clarity of his proposed change. But Wes says,\n\n“That’s not a change! That’s just running a database script. If you were\n\nchanging the script, then we’d have something to talk about. Next.”\n\nThe lead replies quickly, “No, it’s definitely a change. It temporarily\n\nchanges some database settings, and we don’t know what production impact\n\nit could have. To me, it’s just as risky as a database configuration change.”\n\nIs it a change or not? I can see both sides of the argument.\n\nAfter thirty minutes of arguing, it’s still not clear that we know the\n\ndefinition of what a “change” should be.\n\nWas rebooting a server a change? Yes, because we don’t want anyone\n\nrebooting servers willy-nilly, especially if it’s running a critical service.\n\nHow about turning off a server? Yes, for the same reason.\n\nHow about turning on a server? No, we all thought. That is, until\n\nsomeone came up with the example of turning on a duplicate DHCP server,\n\nwhich screwed up the entire enterprise network for twenty-four hours.\n\nA half hour later, we finally write on the whiteboard: “a ‘change’ is any\n\nactivity that is physical, logical, or virtual to applications, databases,\n\noperating systems, networks, or hardware that could impact services being\n\ndelivered.”\n\nI look at my watch, alarmed that we’ve been in the room for nearly\n\nninety minutes, and we still haven’t even approved our first change. I push\n\nus to move faster, but at the end of our two-hour meeting, we’ve only\n\nposted five changes on the whiteboard.\n\nSurprisingly, no one else seems frustrated except me. Everyone is\n\nvigorously engaged in the discussion, even Patty. Everyone is discussing\n\nrisks of the proposed changes, even discovering that one change wasn’t\n\nnecessary.\n\nEncouraged, I say, “We’ll pick this up on Monday. Get all your cards to\n\nPatty as soon as you can. Patty, what’s the best way for us to process all the\n\ncards?”\n\nShe says tersely, “I’ll set up a basket later today. In the meantime, pile\n\nthem up at the front of the table.”\n\nWhen we adjourn, several people tell me on their way out, “Great\n\nmeeting,” and “I wish we had more time to discuss changes,” and “I’m\n\nlooking forward to Monday.”\n\nOnly Patty has remained behind, arms crossed. “We spent a lot of blood,\n\nsweat, and tears creating our old change management policy, and everyone\n\nstill blew it off. What makes you think this will be any different?”\n\nI shrug. “I don’t know. But we’ll keep trying things until we have a\n\nsystem that works, and I’m going to make sure everyone keeps helping us\n\nget there. It’s not just to satisfy the audit findings. We need some way to\n\nplan, communicate, and make our changes safely. I can guarantee you that\n\nif we don’t change the way we work, I’ll be soon out of a job.”\n\nPointing at her old policy document, she says, “We shouldn’t just throw\n\nall this work out the window. We spent weeks designing it and hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars with consultants, changing our tools around.”\n\nShe tears up slightly. I remind myself of how long she’s been trying to\n\nget this process integrated into the organization.\n\n“I know that there was a lot of good work put into all this process,” I say\n\nsympathetically. “Let’s face it, though. No one was actually following it, as\n\nthe auditors pointed out. We also know that people were gaming the system,\n\njust trying to get their work done.”\n\nI say sincerely, “We may be starting over, but we need all your\n\nexperience and skills to make this work. It’s still your process, and I know\n\nthis is absolutely critical to our success.”\n\n“Okay,” she says, sighing in resignation. “I suppose I care more about\n\nour survival than whether we use our old process or not.”\n\nHer expression changes. “How about I write up the outputs of the\n\nmeeting and the new instructions for submitting requests for changes?”\n\nLater that afternoon, I’m back in the Phoenix war room when Patty calls. I\n\nrun out to the hallway. “What’s up?”\n\nShe sounds stressed. “We’ve got a problem. I was expecting we’d have\n\nfifty changes for us to review next week. But we’re already up to 243\n\nsubmitted changes. I keep getting e-mails from people saying to expect\n\nmore cards over the weekend… I think we’re looking at over four hundred\n\nchanges being made next week!”\n\nHoly crap. Four hundred? How many of these four hundred changes are\n\nhigh risk, potentially affecting Phoenix, the payroll application, or worse?\n\nI suddenly remember Rangemaster duty in the Marines. As\n\nRangemaster, I was responsible for the safety of everyone on the firing\n\nrange. I have a horrifying vision of a mob of four hundred unsupervised\n\neighteen-year-olds jumping out of trucks, running to the firing range, firing\n\ntheir rifles into the air, hooting and hollering…\n\n“Umm, at least people are following the process,” I say, laughing\n\nnervously.\n\nI hear her laugh. “With all the change requests coming in, how are we\n\ngoing to get them all authorized by Monday? Should we put a temporary\n\nhold on changes until we get them all approved?”\n\n“Absolutely not,” I say immediately. “The best way to kill everyone’s\n\nenthusiasm and support is to prevent them from doing what they need to do.\n\nI doubt we’ll get a second chance to get this right.\n\n“Send out an e-mail telling everyone to submit any change for next\n\nweek by Monday. Monday’s changes will not need to be authorized but\n\nchanges for the remainder of the week will. No exceptions.”\n\nI can hear Patty typing over the phone. “Got it. I’ll probably need to\n\nhave some of my people help organize all of the change cards over the\n\nweekend. Frankly, I’m stunned by how many changes there are.”\n\nSo am I.\n\n“Excellent,” I say, leaving my concerns unvoiced.\n\nChapter 7 • Friday, September 5\n\nWhen I get back to my desk, I’m looking for the Advil I usually keep on my\n\ndesk when my cell phone rings. “Palmer here,” I say, rummaging through\n\nmy drawers.\n\n“Hi, Bill. It’s Stacy—Steve’s assistant. I’m glad I caught you. There’s a\n\npotential new board member in town named Erik Reid who needs to talk\n\nwith all the IT executives. He’s wondering if you’re available for an hour\n\nright now.”\n\n“Hang on a sec while I pull up my calendar,” I reply.\n\nThe screen resolution on this old laptop is so low that the weekly view is\n\nunusable. I switch to the daily view, and the screen goes blank as the laptop\n\nchatters and whirs.\n\nI give up waiting and say earnestly, “Look, I know this is important, but\n\ncan’t this wait until Monday? You would not believe the day I’m having.”\n\nShe replies quickly, “I wish it could wait, but he’s only in town today.\n\nAnd from what I’ve seen, Bob Strauss, you know, the new company\n\nchairman, and Steve are in a tizzy because they’re worried that Erik may\n\nnot accept our offer to join the board. He’s apparently some technology\n\nhotshot, and Bob and Steve managed to get him in town to woo him. He\n\ninsists on meeting the IT leadership team before he leaves.”\n\n“Okay, I’m in,” I say, suppressing a sigh.\n\n“Good. We have him set up in the conference room right by me. Come\n\non over—there’s a great coffee and doughnut spread here.”",

      "content": "I laugh. “Well, that’s the first good news I’ve had all day. I’m on my\n\nway.”\n\nAs I walk into the conference room in Building 2, I wave to Stacy,\n\npondering the strange world I’ve been pulled into. I’m not used to being\n\nthrown into the middle of board politics.\n\nAs promised, by the window is a large cart with four types of coffee and\n\nsix boxes of Vandal Doughnuts, a place in town so famous, there’s a long\n\nline at almost all hours of the day.\n\nA man in wrinkled khaki pants and an untucked denim button-down\n\nshirt is kneeling in front of the cart, unpacking the doughnuts onto two\n\nplatters. I had no idea Vandal Doughnuts delivered.\n\nI pick up a cup and start filling it with coffee, eyeing all the doughnuts. I\n\nsay, “You know, my wife and I are huge fans of you guys. Back when we\n\nwere dating, almost every Friday night we’d wait in line for twenty minutes\n\nto get our fix. Now that we have kids, she just sends me out to get them for\n\nher. Maybe I’ll take one home for her tonight.”\n\nI grab a huge chocolate doughnut covered with Froot Loops, as well as a\n\ngiant frosted glazed doughnut with bacon on it and three more that look\n\ntasty.\n\nThe deliveryman stands up and looks at me, smiling. “Yeah, I can see\n\nwhy. I’m really enjoying these doughnuts. I’ve never had anything like\n\nthem before. I’ve probably eaten five since I’ve been here. Not great for the\n\nlow-carb diet I’m on, though…”\n\nHolding out his hand, he says, “I’m Erik.”\n\nHoly crap.\n\nI look down. In one hand I have a cup of coffee, and in the other hand\n\nI’m holding an overflowing plate.\n\n“Oh, jeez,” I say hurriedly. I put everything on the table behind me,\n\nturning around again to shake his hand. “Good to meet you. I’m Bill—Bill\n\nPalmer.”\n\nI look him over again. He has a mustache, is around six feet tall and a\n\nbit overweight, and has long graying hair that touches his shoulders. When\n\nstanding, he looks even more like someone from a delivery company than a\n\npotential board member, let alone some “technology hotshot.”\n\nTaking another look at him, I correct myself—I’m pretty sure a delivery\n\nperson would have less-wrinkled clothes.\n\n“No worries,” he says cheerily, grabbing another doughnut from the tray\n\nand gesturing toward the table. “Have a seat. I was hoping to talk with each\n\nof the IT leaders while I was in town. Of course, I had to talk with Steve\n\nand—umm—what’s your CFO’s name? Darren? Dale? Whatever—they\n\nseemed like nice enough fellows. Maybe a little blind, but…”\n\nHe gestures dismissively. “I talked with your Development guy, too.\n\nUmm, Cary? Calvin? And, I’ll be talking with your Security guy next,\n\nJimmy, and your Retailing person, Sylvia.”\n\nI try to hide my pained expression as he’s managed to mangle\n\neveryone’s name.\n\n“I see… And what have your impressions been so far?” I ask carefully.\n\nHe stops chewing and brushes some crumbs off his mustache, pausing\n\nto think. “It looks like you’re in a world of hurt. IT Operations seems to\n\nhave lodged itself in every major flow of work, including the top company\n\nproject. It has all the executives hopping mad, and they’re turning the\n\nscrews on your Development guy to do whatever it takes to get it into\n\nproduction.”\n\nHe looks me in the eye. “You’re having chronic IT availability issues,\n\ncausing company executives to be splashed on the front-page news. And\n\nnow, Audit is hot on your tail, meaning more possible front-page news, and\n\nmaybe even an adverse footnote on the quarterly financial statement. And\n\nanyone who knows anything about Phoenix knows that there’s a lot more\n\nbad news to come on that front…”\n\nAs he’s talking, I feel my face flush red, whether in anger or\n\nembarrassment I’m not sure.\n\n“Things don’t look so good for you, pal,” he says. “At least not to a\n\nprospective board member, who’s supposed to oversee and assess your\n\nperformance.”\n\nI purse my lips, resisting the urge to say something that sounds\n\ndefensive. I say neutrally, “Steve asked me to take this job three days ago.\n\nEven though I kept saying no, he eventually convinced me to accept the\n\nposition. There’ve sure been a lot of surprises…”\n\nHe looks at me for a moment, and then guffaws. “Yeah, I’ll bet!” he\n\nsays, disarmingly. “Ha-ha! Surprises. So, what’s your game plan for\n\nrighting the ship?”\n\nI look up for a moment, trying to figure out how to describe the few\n\ncorrective actions I’ve put in place after this week. I reply, “Honestly, I’m\n\nstill trying to get some situational awareness. Mostly, I’m being whiplashed\n\nfrom one emergency to another. I do know that we need more rigor and\n\ndiscipline in how we work. I’m trying to figure out what processes we rely\n\non to get work done around here. Based on what I’ve seen, I know we need\n\nto improve them so we stop shooting ourselves in the foot.”\n\nI think for a moment. “That’s just to get us out of firefighting mode. I’m\n\nstill trying to figure out how to resource an audit remediation project that\n\njust fell out of the sky. Based on what I’ve seen, we’re seriously behind on\n\nour commitments. We’re obviously going to need more people or get a lot\n\nmore efficient to get all our committed work done.”\n\nErik frowns. “‘Rigor and discipline,’ huh? I’m guessing you were a non-\n\ncommissioned officer in the military. An E-6. No, you’re too young. An E-5,\n\nright?”\n\nI blink in surprise. “That’s right. E-5, US Marine Corp. How did you\n\nknow?”\n\n“Lucky guess,” he says glibly. “For one thing, you sure don’t look like a\n\nchemical engineer or an auditor.”\n\n“What?” I ask.\n\n“You’re right that you can’t achieve the strategic until you’ve mastered\n\nthe tactical,” he says, ignoring my question. “But what worked for you in\n\nthe Marines will never work here, considering how they run this circus.\n\nInstead of one general in your chain of command, you’ve got ten generals\n\ncalling the shots here, and all of them have a direct line to each and every\n\nprivate in your company.“\n\nI say slowly, “Wait. You’re saying rigor and discipline don’t matter?”\n\n“Of course they matter,” he says sternly. “But you have a much bigger\n\nproblem, and it has nothing to do with your argle-bargle of ‘efficiencies’\n\nand ‘process.’ Your problem right now is that you obviously don’t actually\n\nknow what ‘work’ is.”\n\nI stare at him.\n\nWho is this buffoon? For a moment, I wonder whether I can assign Wes\n\nor Patty to deal with this guy, but Steve obviously wanted me to handle this\n\npersonally.\n\n“I know what work is,” I say slowly. “We do it every day. If we can’t\n\nkeep the lights on and finish the work that the business requires, I’m out of\n\na job.”\n\n“What then, exactly, is your definition of ‘work?’” he asks, with a\n\ngenuinely curious expression on his face.\n\n“Well, I can tell you that Steve has stated over and over to me in no\n\nuncertain terms that we need to get Phoenix out the door. That qualifies as\n\nwork in my mind.”\n\nHe looks up, appearing to have a conversation with himself. “Yes, that’s\n\ncertainly one type of work. But you’re still missing the three other types of\n\nwork that IT Operations is responsible for. To me, that’s nowhere near the\n\nlevel of understanding of work you need in order to fix your problems\n\naround project deliverables, outages, and compliance.”\n\nHe stands up. “Grab your stuff. We’re going for a ride.”\n\nConfused and annoyed, I look at my watch. It’s 4:17 p.m. I have too\n\nmuch to do to waste much more time with this guy.\n\nThen he’s gone. I look out in the hallway, but he’s not there, either. I\n\nlook at Stacy questioningly, and she points toward the elevators. I run to\n\ncatch up with him.\n\nHe’s walked into an elevator that just opened. When he turns around, he\n\nholds the door open for me. “You probably don’t even see when work is\n\ncommitted to your organization. And if you can’t see it, you can’t manage\n\nit—let alone organize it, sequence it, and have any assurance that your\n\nresources can complete it.”\n\nI frown, recalling my last meeting with Wes and Patty when they\n\nstruggled to come up with the list of all our commitments to the\n\norganization. I say, “What is this? Some kind of intelligence test?”\n\n“Yes, you could say that,” he replies. “But don’t worry. It’s not just you.\n\nSteve has to pass his intelligence test, too. And for that matter, Dick, as\n\nwell.”\n\nI follow him to his blue subcompact rental car and we drive five minutes\n\nto MRP-8, one of our manufacturing plants. It’s enormous, probably four\n\ntimes bigger than my building, but this one is in immaculate condition, with\n\nsome obvious recent renovations and add-ons.\n\nA security guard in her late fifties greets us, “Good afternoon, Dr. Reid.\n\nHow nice to see you! How are you doing? It’s been a long time.”\n\nErik shakes her hand warmly, replying with a wink, “Great seeing you\n\nagain, Dorothy. We’re just here to get a birds-eye view of the plant floor.\n\nCan we still get on the catwalk?”\n\nShe replies with a flirtatious smile, “It’s closed to most people, but for\n\nyou, I think we can make an exception.”\n\nI look at Erik suspiciously. He supposedly couldn’t get anyone’s name\n\nright, and yet he apparently remembers the name of some security guard\n\nfrom years past. And no one ever mentioned anything about a Dr. Reid.\n\nAfter climbing five flights of stairs, we’re standing on a catwalk that\n\noverlooks the entire plant floor, looking like it goes on for at least two city\n\nblocks in every direction.\n\n“Look down there,” he says. “You can see loading docks on each side of\n\nthe building. Raw materials are brought in on this side, and the finished\n\ngoods leave out the other. Orders come off that printer down there. If you\n\nstand here long enough, you can actually see all the WIP, that’s ‘work in\n\nprocess’ or ‘inventory’ for plant newbies, make its way toward the other\n\nside of the plant floor, where it’s shipped to customers as finished goods.”\n\n“For decades at this plant,” he continues, “there were piles of inventory\n\neverywhere. In many places, it was piled as high as you could stack them\n\nusing those big forklifts over there. On some days, you couldn’t even see\n\nthe other side of the building. In hindsight, we now know that WIP is one of\n\nthe root causes for chronic due-date problems, quality issues, and expediters\n\nhaving to rejuggle priorities every day. It’s amazing that this business didn’t\n\ngo under as a result.”\n\nHe gestures broadly with both arms outstretched, “In the 1980s, this\n\nplant was the beneficiary of three incredible scientifically-grounded\n\nmanagement movements. You’ve probably heard of them: the Theory of\n\nConstraints, Lean production or the Toyota Production System, and Total\n\nQuality Management. Although each movement started in different places,\n\nthey all agree on one thing: WIP is the silent killer. Therefore, one of the\n\nmost critical mechanisms in the management of any plant is job and\n\nmaterials release. Without it, you can’t control WIP.”\n\nHe points at a desk near the loading docks closest to us. “See that desk\n\nover there?”\n\nI nod but also look pointedly at my watch: 4:45 p.m.\n\nOblivious to my impatience, he says, “Let me tell you a story. Decades\n\nago, there used to be a guy named Mark. He was the supervisor for that first\n\nwork center, right down there by that desk. Those racks hold the folders for\n\nincoming jobs. Isn’t it amazing that those folders look exactly like they did\n\nback then?\n\n“At any rate,” he continues, “one day I see Mark picking up a folder to\n\nstart some job. I ask him, ‘On what basis did you choose that job, versus\n\nany of the others?’\n\n“And you know what he tells me? He says, ‘It’s a job that requires this\n\nwork center first. And we’re open.’”\n\nHe shakes his head incredulously. “I could hardly believe it. I tell him,\n\n‘Your station is just the first of twenty operations. You don’t factor the\n\navailability of any of the other nineteen stations in your decision?’ And he\n\nreplies, ‘Well, no. This is the way I’ve done it for twenty years.’”\n\nHe laughs. “I suppose to him, it sounds like a reasonable way to pick\n\nwhich job to perform. He’s keeping the first station busy, and it’s similar to\n\nfirst-in, first-out scheduling. But of course, now everyone knows that you\n\ndon’t release work based on the availability of the first station. Instead, it\n\nshould be based on the tempo of how quickly the bottleneck resource can\n\nconsume the work.”\n\nI just stare at him blankly.\n\nHe continues, “Because of how Mark was releasing work, inventory\n\nkept piling up in front of our bottleneck, and jobs were never finished on\n\ntime. Every day was an emergency. For years, we were awarded Best\n\nCustomer of the Year from our air freight shipment company, because we\n\nwere overnighting thousands of pounds of finished goods to angry\n\ncustomers almost every week.”\n\nHe pauses and then says emphatically, “Eliyahu M. Goldratt, who\n\ncreated the Theory of Constraints, showed us how any improvements made\n\nanywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion. Astonishing, but true! Any\n\nimprovement made after the bottleneck is useless, because it will always\n\nremain starved, waiting for work from the bottleneck. And any\n\nimprovements made before the bottleneck merely results in more inventory\n\npiling up at the bottleneck.”\n\nHe continues, “In our case, our bottleneck was a heat treat oven, just\n\nlike in Goldratt’s novel, The Goal. We also had paint-curing booths that\n\nlater became constraints, too. By the time we froze the release of all new\n\njobs, you couldn’t even see the bottleneck work centers because they were\n\nsurrounded by huge piles of inventory. Even from up here!”\n\nDespite myself, I laugh with him. It’s obvious in hindsight, but I can\n\nimagine that to Mark, it was anything but obvious. “Look, thanks for the\n\nhistory lesson. But I learned most of this already in business school. I don’t\n\nsee how this could possibly be relevant to managing IT Operations. IT is not\n\nlike running a factory.”\n\n“Oh, really?” he turns to me, frowning intensely. “Let me guess. You’re\n\ngoing to say that IT is pure knowledge work, and so therefore, all your work\n\nis like that of an artisan. Therefore, there’s no place for standardization,\n\ndocumented work procedures, and all that high-falutin’ ‘rigor and\n\ndiscipline’ that you claimed to hold so near and dear.”\n\nI frown. I can’t figure out if he’s trying to convince me of something I\n\nalready believe or trying to get me to accept an absurd conclusion.\n\n“If you think IT Operations has nothing to learn from Plant Operations,\n\nyou’re wrong. Dead wrong,” he says. “Your job as VP of IT Operations is to\n\nensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that\n\ndelivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption\n\nof unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure IT\n\nservice.”\n\nListening to him, I wonder if I should be writing this down.\n\nHe studies me closely. “Well, I can see that we’re not ready to have this\n\ndiscussion. Until you gain a better understanding of what work is, any\n\nconversation we have about controlling work will be totally lost on you. It\n\nwould be like talking about acrobatics to someone who doesn’t believe in\n\ngravity yet.\n\n“Rest assured, though,” he says, pointing at the job release desk, “in\n\norder to get to where you want to go, eventually you will need to figure out\n\nwhat your equivalent to that desk is. You must figure out how to control the\n\nrelease of work into IT Operations and, more importantly, ensure that your\n\nmost constrained resources are doing only the work that serves the goal of\n\nthe entire system, not just one silo.\n\n“Once you figure this out, young Bill, you will be well on your way\n\ntoward understanding the Three Ways,” he says. “The First Way helps us\n\nunderstand how to create fast flow of work as it moves from Development\n\ninto IT Operations, because that’s what’s between the business and the\n\ncustomer. The Second Way shows us how to shorten and amplify feedback\n\nloops, so we can fix quality at the source and avoid rework. And the Third\n\nWay shows us how to create a culture that simultaneously fosters\n\nexperimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition\n\nand practice are the prerequisites to mastery.”\n\nAlthough he now sounds oddly like Master Shifu in the movie Kung Fu\n\nPanda, I’m listening intently. The need for rigor and discipline, and\n\nconstantly practicing and honing our skills are important lessons I’ve kept\n\nwith me from the Marines. The lives of my men depended upon it there, and\n\nmy job depends upon it here. Creating that predictability is what I’m most\n\nintent on instilling in my IT Operations group.\n\nErik hands me a slip of paper with a phone number on it. “Remember,\n\nthere are four types of work. You’ve named business project work as one.\n\nWhen you have the other three, give me a call.”\n\nHe takes out his car keys from his pocket and asks, “Do you want a lift\n\nback to your office?”\n\nIt’s 5:10 p.m. when I finally get back to my cubicle. I log back into my\n\nclunker laptop to reply to e-mails. But I can’t concentrate.\n\nThe last hour with Erik was like being in a strange parallel universe. Or\n\nlike being forced to watch a psychedelic movie made in a drug-induced\n\nhaze.\n\nWhat did Erik mean that there were four categories of work?\n\nI think back to my meeting with Wes and Patty. Wes mentioned we have\n\na separate list for IT infrastructure projects and business projects. Are\n\ninfrastructure projects another type of work?\n\nAs I ponder this, an e-mail notification window pops up on my screen,\n\nindicating another e-mail expecting a response.\n\nAre e-mails another type of work?\n\nI doubt it. At the plant, Erik gestured to the entire plant floor. When he\n\nmentioned “work,” he seemed to mean it at an organizational level not at\n\nthe level of an individual contributor or manager.\n\nI think about it some more. Then I shake my head and quickly e-mail\n\nSteve, letting them know that I connected with Erik. I’m certain that a\n\ndecade from now, I’ll be telling my friends about my brief encounter with\n\nthe raving madman on the manufacturing plant floor.\n\nI need to get moving. Page will be seriously annoyed if I come home\n\nlate on a Friday night. When I undock the laptop from the docking station,\n\nan incredibly loud alarm pierces the air.\n\n“Holy crap!” I shout, realizing that the sound is coming from my laptop.\n\nFumbling, I try to turn down the volume, to power it off, but nothing makes\n\nthe sound stop.\n\nFrantically, I flip the laptop over and try to take the battery out, but the\n\ntape keeps it attached. I grab a letter opener, finally managing to slash the\n\ntape and get the battery out.\n\nThe laptop finally goes silent.\n\nChapter 8 • Monday, September 8\n\nI spent all weekend working on a PowerPoint slide deck for my meeting\n\nwith Steve this morning. Despite all that work, I wish I could have done\n\nmore to prepare.\n\nI force myself to relax, visualizing having a healthy and vigorous\n\nbusiness discussion with him, walking out with everything I ask for. I keep\n\nreminding myself how important this is for the company and my\n\norganization. Everyone worked so hard to prepare for this and now success\n\nor failure depends on how well I can communicate it all to Steve.\n\nStacy smiles when I arrive and says warmly, “Go on in. I’m sorry we\n\ncould only get you thirty minutes.”\n\nI stop just inside the door, where Sarah is sitting with Steve at the table.\n\nSarah is telling Steve, “—you did an amazing job telling the story of where\n\nwe’re going. These were some of the most skeptical analysts around, but\n\nthey clearly got excited. You’ve also given them a reason for us to talk\n\nagain when Phoenix goes live. They also seem pretty impressed with the\n\nPhoenix roadmap.”\n\nThey’re telling analysts about the Phoenix roadmap? With so many\n\nfeatures being delayed to the next release, I question the wisdom of making\n\ninsufficiently informed promises to the market.\n\nSteve just nods and replies happily, “Let’s see if it changes their\n\nimpressions of us. Good job scheduling the call. Catch you later today for\n\nthe next one.”",

You’re up and at it early\n\ntoday, aren’t you?”\n\nGritting my teeth, I just ignore her comment. “Good morning,\n\neveryone.” Trying to show an interest, I say, “Sounds like you had a good\n\ncall.”\n\nSarah smiles even more broadly. “Yes, they’re really excited about our\n\nvision and agree that it’s going to be a real game changer for us. This is\n\nwhat we need to change how we’re perceived by the broader market and\n\nWall Street.”\n\nI look levelly at her, wondering whether these briefings that we give the\n\noutside world might be what is causing such pressure on Chris’ team to\n\nrelease features so prematurely.\n\nI grab a seat across from Steve. I can’t quite turn my back on Sarah, but\n\nI do my best.\n\nI don’t want to give Steve my handouts until Sarah has left the room, but\n\nshe continues to talk with Steve, recounting their meeting and how to\n\nchange the talk track for their next analyst call.\n\nAs they talk, all I can think of is how she’s eating into my time with\n\nSteve.\n\nEleven minutes later, Steve laughs at a joke from Sarah, and she finally\n\nleaves the office, closing the door behind her. Steve turns to me and says,\n\n“Sorry about going over—our next Phoenix analyst briefing is in twenty\n\nminutes. So, what’s on your mind?”\n\n“You’ve impressed upon me from the very beginning that I need to help\n\nmaximize the probability of success of the Phoenix rollout,” I start. “Based\n\non my observations of the past week, we are stretched dangerously thin, to\n\nthe point that I believe Phoenix is in considerable jeopardy.\n\n“I’ve had my staff establish what our levels of demand and capacity\n\ntruly are,” I continue. “We’ve started to inventory everything we’re being\n\nasked to do, regardless of how big or small. Based on the analysis so far, it’s\n\nclear to me that the demand for IT work far exceeds our ability to deliver.\n\nI’ve asked them to make more visible what the pipeline of work looks like,\n\nso we can make more informed decisions about who should be working on\n\nwhat and when.”\n\nWith as much gravitas as I can muster, I say, “One thing is very clear,\n\nthough. We are definitely understaffed. There’s no way that we can deliver\n\neverything we’ve promised. Either we need to cut down the project list, or\n\nwe’ve got to staff up.”\n\nTrying to replicate the reasoned and logical argument I’ve spent all\n\nweekend rehearsing, I continue, “The other big problem is that we have too\n\nmany different projects competing for our attention. You’ve been consistent\n\nand clear that Phoenix is the most important, but we can’t seem to keep\n\nresources dedicated to it. For instance, last Thursday, internal audit\n\ndelivered to us a set of findings that we must investigate and assemble a\n\nresponse letter for in one week. Doing so will impact Phoenix.”\n\nI’ve been watching Steve as I talked, and so far, he’s remained\n\nexpressionless. I look at him calmly and ask, “What I’d like to get out of\n\nour meeting is an understanding of the relative priority of Phoenix versus\n\nthe audit findings and to talk about the number of projects and how to\n\nadequately staff them.”\n\nIn my mind, I’ve done a good job of being the competent and passionate\n\nmanager who is dispassionately struggling to decide how to best serve the\n\nbusiness, without making moral judgments.\n\nSteve replies in an exasperated voice, “What kind of bullshit\n\nprioritization question is this? If I went to my board and told them that I\n\nneed to do either sales or marketing, and asked them which of those I\n\nshould do, I’d be laughed out of the room. I need to do both, just like you\n\nneed to do both! Life is tough. Phoenix is the top company priority, but that\n\ndoesn’t mean you get to hold the SOX-404 audit hostage.”\n\nI count to three before saying, “Obviously, I’m not being clear. Both\n\nPhoenix and the compliance project share certain key resources, such as\n\nBrent. The compliance project alone would tie up these people for a year,\n\nbut we need them focused on Phoenix. On top of that, our infrastructure is\n\nso fragile, that we have daily failures, which often require these same\n\nresources to restore normal operations. If a similar outage to the payroll run\n\nfailure happened today, we’d likely have to pull Brent off both the Phoenix\n\nand compliance work to figure out what went wrong.”\n\nI look at him dead-on and say, “We’ve looked at different resourcing\n\noptions, including hiring and moving people around, but none of them will\n\nhave any effect fast enough to make a difference. If Phoenix is really the top\n\npriority, we need to put some of the compliance work on hold.”\n\n“Out of the question,” he says, before I can even finish. “I’ve seen that\n\nbig pile of audit findings, and we will be in very hot water if we don’t get\n\nthose issues fixed.”\n\nThis is definitely not going according to plan. “Okay…” I say slowly.\n\n“We’ll do our best, but let me state for the record that we’re too\n\nunderstaffed to do a good job on either one, let alone both.”\n\nI wait for him to acknowledge my point. Seconds go by before he finally\n\nnods.\n\nRealizing this is probably the best I’m going to get, I indicate to the first\n\npage of the handout I gave him. I say, “Let’s zoom up and talk about project\n\ndemand and capacity. We’re currently supporting over thirty-five business\n\nprojects through Kirsten’s Project Management Office, and at current count,\n\nseventy-plus other smaller business projects and internal initiatives. And\n\nthere are others out there that we just haven’t counted yet. With our 143 IT\n\nOperations people, nothing is getting done as promised.”\n\nI point him to the second page of the handout, saying, “As you can see,\n\nmy team and I have come up with a request for six additional resources that\n\nwe’re most short-handed on.”\n\nI go for the close, saying, “My goal is to increase our throughput so we\n\nwon’t be in this position again, and to get as many of these projects done as\n\nwe can. I’d like your approval to get these openings immediately, so we can\n\nstart our search. Talent like Brent is not easy to find, and we need to start\n\nsooner rather than later.”\n\nIn my rehearsals, this is when Steve would run his finger down the\n\nfigures, ask me some questions, and we’d have a meaningful discussion\n\nabout how to make the best trade-offs. Maybe he’d even pat me on the back\n\nand compliment me on the quality of my analysis.\n\nBut Steve doesn’t even pick up my handouts. Instead, he looks at me\n\nand says, “Bill, Phoenix is already $10 million over budget, and we must\n\nget cash-flow positive soon. You have some of the most expensive\n\nresources in the entire company. You have to use what you’ve got.”\n\nHe crosses his arms and continues, “Last year, we had some IT analysts\n\ncome in and benchmark our company against our peers. They told us that\n\nwe’re spending way more on IT than our competitors.\n\n“You may think that with three thousand employees, six more\n\nemployees won’t make a difference. But, trust me, every expense is under\n\nscrutiny. If I can’t close the profitability gap, I’ll have to do another layoff.\n\nYour math of adding another $2 million in labor costs just doesn’t work.”\n\nHe continues in a more sympathetic voice. “My suggestion to you? Go\n\nto your peers and make your case to them. If your case is really valid, they\n\nshould be willing to transfer some of their budget to you. But let me be\n\nclear: Any budget increases are out of the question. If anything, we may\n\nhave to cut some heads in your area.”\n\nI spent hours role-playing worst-case scenarios over the weekend.\n\nApparently, I’m going to have to practice being more pessimistic.\n\n“Steve, I don’t know how I can be more clear about this,” I say, feeling a\n\nlittle desperate. “This stuff isn’t magic. All this work being piled on us is\n\ndone by real people. Commitments like the compliance work are made\n\nwithout any regard for what’s already on people’s plates, like Phoenix.”\n\nRealizing I have little to lose, but trying to shock some sense into him, I\n\nsay, “If you really care about closing the gap with the competition by\n\nhaving Phoenix succeed, you sure aren’t acting like it. To me, it seems like\n\nyou’re just being suckered to rush to the gunfight late, showing up with\n\nonly a knife.”\n\nI expected some kind of reaction but he merely leans back, crossing his\n\narms in front. “We’re all doing our best. So you better go back and do the\n\nsame.”\n\nJust then, the door opens as Sarah walks in. “Hi, Steve. Sorry to\n\ninterrupt, but we have the next analyst call in two minutes. Shall I dial us\n\nin?”\n\nShit. I look down at my watch. 9:27.\n\nShe even robbed me of my last three minutes.\n\nUtterly defeated, I finally say, “Okay, got it. Keep pushing. I’ll keep you\n\nposted.”\n\nSteve nods in thanks, and then turns to Sarah as I close the door behind\n\nme. On my way out, I toss the presentation I had worked on all weekend\n\ninto Stacy’s recycling bin.\n\nI try to wave away the stench of failure as I walk to the CAB meeting. I’m\n\nstill thinking about how I’m going to break the bad news to Wes and Patty\n\nwhen I walk into the conference room that Patty has coined the Change\n\nCoordination Room.\n\nAll thoughts of Steve disappear when I see what’s there.\n\nAlmost every area of the wall is now covered in whiteboards. Index\n\ncards cover nearly every inch of the whiteboards on two of the walls. It’s\n\nnot just one deep—in some places there are hooks attached to the board,\n\nwith ten cards hanging off them.\n\nOn the conference room table are twenty, maybe even thirty, more piles\n\nof cards.\n\nOn the far side of the table, two guys who work for Patty have their\n\nbacks to us, studying a card. After a moment, they tape it between two other\n\ncards in front of them.\n\n“Holy crap,” I say.\n\n“We’ve got a problem.” Patty says from behind me.\n\n“Not enough space for more whiteboards?” I say, only half joking.\n\nBefore Patty answers, I hear Wes enter the room. “Holy shit!” he says.\n\nWhere did all these cards come from? Are they all for this week?”\n\nI turn to ask him, “Are you surprised? Most of these are coming from\n\nyour group.”\n\nHe looks around at all the boards and then at the cards on the table, “I\n\nknew that my guys were really busy, but, there must be a couple of hundred\n\nchanges here.”\n\nPatty turns her laptop around to show us the spreadsheet she has open,\n\n“Since last Friday afternoon, there have been 437 changes submitted for\n\nthis week.”\n\nWes for once is speechless. He finally shakes his head and says, “And\n\nnow we’re supposed to go through and approve all of them? This meeting\n\nwas only scheduled for an hour—we’d need days to go through all of\n\nthese!”\n\nHe looks at me. “Mind you, I’m not saying that we shouldn’t, but if\n\nwe’re going to do this every week…”\n\nAgain, Wes stops speaking, overwhelmed at the task in front of us.\n\nQuite honestly, I feel the same way. Apparently, getting all the managers\n\nto submit their changes for the week was just the first step. I didn’t expect\n\nthat the process would fall apart as we went beyond collecting the data and\n\nactually set out to process and authorize the changes.\n\nI force myself to say cheerfully, “This is a great start. Like most things,\n\nthings get worse before they get better. We’ve got enthusiastic support from\n\nthe technical managers, so now we’ve got to figure out how to get these\n\nchanges scrutinized and scheduled on an on-going basis. Any ideas?”\n\nPatty is first to speak up. “Well, no one says that we have to be the ones\n\nreviewing all the changes—maybe we can push down some of these to\n\ndelegates.”\n\nI listen to Wes and Patty trade ideas back and forth before I say, “Let’s\n\ngo back to our goals: get the left and right hands to know what the other is\n\ndoing, give us some situational awareness during outages, and give audit\n\nsome evidence that we’re addressing change control.\n\n“We need to focus on the riskiest changes,” I continue. “The 80/20 rule\n\nlikely applies here: Twenty percent of the changes pose eighty percent of\n\nthe risk.”\n\nI stare again at piles of cards in front of us and pick up a couple at\n\nrandom, searching for some inspiration.\n\nHolding up a card that has a big frowny face drawn on it, I ask, “What’s\n\nPUCCAR?”\n\n“That goddamned app,” Wes says with disgust, “is the Parts Unlimited\n\nCheck Clearing and Reconciliation application that someone implemented\n\nalmost two decades ago. We call it ‘pucker’ because every time we change\n\nit, it blows up, and no one knows how to fix it. The vendor went out of\n\nbusiness during the dot-com boom, but we’ve never gotten funding to\n\nreplace it.”\n\nI ask, “If we know it’s that prone to crashing, why do we need to change\n\nit?”\n\nWes says quickly, “We try not to. But sometimes the business rules\n\nchange, and we also have to keep it patched. It’s running an operating\n\nsystem that’s out of maintenance, so it’s always dicey…”\n\n“Good! It’s a risky change. What other types of changes are being\n\nsubmitted like PUCCAR?” I ask.\n\nWe make a pile of nearly fifty cards proposing changes to the Rainbow,\n\nSaturn, and Taser applications, and also changes to the network and certain\n\nshared databases, which could impact a significant portion, or even all, of\n\nthe business.\n\n“Even looking at those cards makes my heart palpitate,” Wes says.\n\n“These are some of the dangerous changes we make around here.”\n\nHe’s right. I say, “Okay, let’s mark all of these as ‘fragile.’ These are\n\nhigh risk and must be authorized by the CAB. Patty, changes like this should\n\nbe at the top of the pile during our meetings.”\n\nPatty nods, taking notes saying, “Got it. We’re predefining high-risk\n\ncategories of change that not only must have change requests submitted, but\n\nmust have authorization before being scheduled and implemented.”\n\nWe quickly create a list of the top ten most fragile services, applications,\n\nand infrastructure. Any change request that could affect any of these will be\n\nimmediately flagged for CAB scrutiny.\n\nPatty adds, “We need to create some standard procedures around these\n\nchanges—like when we’ll want them implemented—and have key\n\nresources not only aware of them but also standing by, just in case things go\n\nwrong—even the vendors.”\n\nShe adds with a half smile, “You know, like having firefighters and\n\nambulances lined up on the runway, ready to spray safety foam when the\n\nairplane lands in flames.”\n\nWes laughs and adds wryly, “Yeah, in the case of PUCCAR, have the\n\ncoroner stock up on a bunch of body bags, too. And a PR person ready to\n\nhandle the angry phone calls from the business, saying that some customers\n\nwere allergic to the foam we used.”\n\nI laugh. “You know, that’s an interesting idea. Let’s let the business\n\nchoose the foam. There’s no reason why all the responsibility should rest on\n\nour shoulders. We can send an e-mail out to the business ahead of time and\n\nask when the best implementation time would be. If we can give them data\n\non the outcomes of previous changes, they may even withdraw the change.”\n\nPatty is typing away. “Got it. For these types of changes, I’ll have my\n\nstaff generate some reports on the changes’ success rates and any associated\n\ndowntime. This will help the business make more informed decisions\n\naround the changes.”\n\nI’m extremely pleased with Patty’s idea and am confident that we’re on\n\nthe right track. “Okay, that still leaves four hundred cards to go. Any\n\nideas?”\n\nWes has been going through the cards methodically, creating two big\n\nstacks of cards next to him. He picks a card from the bigger pile, “This pile\n\nhas changes we do all the time. Like this one about the monthly tax table\n\nupload to the POS systems. I don’t think we should suspend any of these\n\nchanges.\n\n“On the other hand, these changes are stuff like ‘increasing the Java\n\napplication server thread pool size,’ ‘installing the Kumquat vendor\n\napplication hotfix to resolve performance issue,’ and ‘resetting the\n\nKentucky data center load balancer to default duplex settings.’\n\n“What the hell do I know about these things?” Wes says. “I just don’t\n\nknow enough about the context to have an actual opinion worth a damn. I\n\ndon’t want to be like a seagull, flying in, crapping on people, and then\n\nflying away, you know?”\n\nExcited, Patty says, “Excellent! The first ones are the low-risk changes\n\nthat ITIL calls ‘standard changes.’ For changes we’ve done many times\n\nbefore successfully, we just preapprove. They still need to be submitted, but\n\nthey can be scheduled without us.”\n\nWhen everyone nods, she continues, “That leaves about two hundred\n\nchanges that are medium-risk changes that we still need to look at.”\n\n“I agree with Wes,” I respond. “For these, we need to trust that the\n\nmanager knows what he or she is doing. But I’d like Patty to verify that\n\npeople have appropriately informed anyone they could affect, and gotten\n\nthe ‘okay to proceed’ from all of them.”\n\nI think for a moment and say, “Take John’s tokenization application.\n\nBefore that change request would even come to us, I would expect him to\n\nget the nod from the application and database owners, and also the business.\n\nIf he’s done that, that’s good enough for me. I view our role as making sure\n\nthat he’s dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s. At this level, I care more about\n\nthe integrity of the process, not so much about the actual changes.”\n\nPatty is typing away. “Let me see if I’ve got this right: For the ‘messy\n\nmiddle changes,’ we’re deciding that the change submitter has\n\nresponsibility and accountability for consulting and getting approval from\n\npeople potentially affected. Once they do that, they submit their change\n\ncard for us to review and approve for scheduling.”\n\nI smile and say, “Yep. Work for you, Wes?”\n\nAt last, he says, “I think it’ll work. Let’s give it a shot.”\n\n“Good,” I say. Then I say to Patty, “You can help make sure the change\n\nrequesters are actually doing all the work beforehand?”\n\nPatty smiles and says, “With pleasure.”\n\nShe looks up at the board, tapping a pen on the table while she thinks.\n\nShe says, “Today is Monday. We’ve already said today’s changes are\n\ncleared for implementation. I propose we extend the amnesty period\n\nthrough tomorrow, and assemble a full CAB meeting for Wednesday, with\n\nthe intent of scheduling the rest of the changes. That should give everyone\n\nenough time to prepare.”\n\nI look at Wes. He says, “This is good, but I’m already thinking about\n\nnext week. We should tell everyone to keep the change requests coming in,\n\nand let’s set up the weekly CAB meetings starting Friday the nineteenth.”\n\nPatty looks as pleased as I am that Wes is planning ahead to the\n\nfollowing week, instead of griping. She says, “I’ll have instructions sent to\n\neveryone in the next couple of hours.”\n\nAfter she finishes typing, she adds, “One last thing. I just want to point\n\nout that we’re tying up two people, as well as myself, running this manual\n\nprocess. It’s very labor intensive. Eventually, we’re going to have to think\n\nabout some way to automate this.”\n\nI nod. “No doubt that this isn’t sustainable in its current form. But let’s\n\nget a couple of CAB meetings under our belt and nail down what exactly the\n\nrules are. I promise you that we’ll revisit this.”\n\nThe meeting winds down and we all leave smiling. That’s a first for my\n\nteam.\n\nChapter 9 • Tuesday, September 9\n\nI’m in the most ruthless budget meeting I’ve ever attended. Dick sits in the\n\nback of the room, listening attentively and occasionally officiating. We all\n\ndefer to him, as he’ll create the first cut of the annual plan. Sarah sits next\n\nto him, tapping away on her iPhone.\n\nI finally pick up the phone. It must be a genuine emergency. It’s been\n\nvibrating almost nonstop for the past minute.\n\nI read, “Sev 1 incident: credit card processing systems down. All stores\n\nimpacted.”\n\nHoly crap.\n\nI know I’ve got to leave this meeting, despite knowing that everyone\n\nwill try to steal my budget. I stand up, struggling with the large laptop,\n\ntrying to keep more pieces from falling off. I almost make it out when Sarah\n\nsays, “Another problem, Bill?”\n\nI grimace. “Nothing that we can’t handle.”\n\nIn reality, any Sev 1 outage automatically qualifies as a very big\n\nproblem, but I don’t want to give her any ammunition.\n\nWhen I get to the NOC, I grab the seat next to Patty, who is coordinating\n\nthe call. “Everyone, Bill just joined us. To catch you up, we have confirmed\n\nthat the order entry systems are down and we have declared a Sev 1\n\nincident. We were just trying to establish what changed.”\n\nShe pauses, looking at me. “And, I’m not confident we actually know.”\n\nI prompt everyone, “Patty asked a pretty simple question. So, what were\n\nall the changes made today that could have led to this outage?”",

Everyone is avoiding eye\n\ncontact.\n\nI’m about to say something when I hear, “This is Chris. I told Patty this\n\nbefore, and I’m telling you again now, none of my developers changed\n\nanything. So cross us off the damned list. It was probably a database\n\nchange.”\n\nSomeone at the end of the table says angrily, “What? We didn’t make\n\nany changes—well, not on anything that could have impacted the order\n\nentry systems. Are you sure it wasn’t an operating system patch gone wrong\n\nagain?”\n\nSomeone two seats over then sits up and says heatedly, “Absolutely not.\n\nWe don’t have any updates scheduled to hit those systems for another three\n\nweeks. I’d bet fifty bucks it was a networking change—their changes are\n\nalways causing problems.”\n\nSlapping both hands over his eyes, Wes shouts, “For crying out loud,\n\nguys!”\n\nLooking exasperated and resigned, he says to someone across the table,\n\n“You need to defend your honor, too? Everyone might as well have a turn.”\n\nSure enough, the Networking lead across the table from him holds up\n\nboth hands, looking hurt and aggrieved. “You know, it really isn’t fair that\n\nNetworking keeps getting blamed for outages. We didn’t have any changes\n\nscheduled for today.”\n\n“Prove it,” the database manager challenges.\n\nThe Networking lead turns bright red, his voice cracking. “This is\n\nbullshit! You’re asking me to prove that we didn’t do anything. How the\n\nhell do you prove a negative? Besides, I’m guessing the problem is a bad\n\nfirewall change. Most of the outages in the last couple of weeks were\n\ncaused by one of them.”\n\nI know I should probably put an end to this madness. Instead, I force\n\nmyself to lean back in my chair and keep observing, one hand covering my\n\nmouth to hide my angry scowl and to keep me from saying something rash.\n\nPatty looks exasperated and turns to me. “No one from John’s team is\n\npresent on the call. His team handles all the firewall changes. Let me try\n\ngetting a hold of him.”\n\nI hear the sounds of loud tapping on a keyboard from the speakerphone,\n\nand then a voice says, “Umm, can someone try it now?”\n\nThere are sounds of multiple people typing on laptop keyboards, as they\n\ntry to access the order entry systems.\n\n“Hold it!” I say loudly, jumping halfway out of my chair, pointing at the\n\nspeakerphone. “Who just said that?”\n\nAn awkward silence lengthens.\n\n“It’s me, Brent.”\n\nGoddamnit.\n\nI force myself to sit down again and take a long, deep breath. “Brent,\n\nthanks for the initiative, but, in a Sev 1 incident, we need to announce and\n\ndiscuss any actions before taking them. The last thing we want to do is to\n\nmake things worse and complicate establishing root cause—”\n\nBefore I can finish, someone at the other end of the table interrupts from\n\nbehind his laptop, “Hey, the systems are back up again. Good work, Brent.”\n\nOh, for chrissakes.\n\nI press my lips together in frustration.\n\nApparently, even undisciplined mobs can get lucky, too.\n\n“Patty, wrap this up,” I say. “I need to see you and Wes in your office\n\nimmediately.” I stand up and leave.\n\nI remain standing in Patty’s office until I have both of their attention.\n\n“Let me make myself clear. For Sev 1 incidents, we cannot fly by the seat\n\nof our pants. Patty, from now on, as the person leading a Sev 1 incident call,\n\nI need you to start the call presenting a timeline of all relevant events,\n\nespecially changes.\n\n“I’m holding you responsible for having that information close-at-hand,\n\nwhich should be easy since you also control the change process. That\n\ninformation comes from you, not all the yahoos on the conference call. Is\n\nthat clear?”\n\nPatty looks back at me, obviously frustrated. I resist the urge to soften\n\nmy words. I know she’s been working hard, and I’ve been piling even more\n\nonto her lately.\n\n“Yeah, totally clear,” she says wearily. “I’ll work on documenting that\n\nprocess and will institute it as quickly as I can.”\n\n“Not good enough,” I say. “I want you to host practice incident calls and\n\nfire drills every two weeks. We need to get everyone used to solving\n\nproblems in a methodical way and to have the timeline available before we\n\ngo into that meeting. If we can’t do this during a prearranged drill, how can\n\nwe expect people to do it during an emergency?”\n\nSeeing the discouraged expression on her face, I put my hand on her\n\nshoulder. “Look, I appreciate all the work you’re doing lately. It’s important\n\nwork, and I don’t know what we’d do without you.”\n\nNext, I turn to Wes. “Impress upon Brent immediately that during\n\nemergencies, everyone must discuss changes they’re thinking about, let\n\nalone the ones they actually implement. I can’t prove it, but I’m guessing\n\nBrent caused the outage, and when he realized it, he undid the change.”\n\nWes is about to respond, but I cut him off.\n\n“Put a stop to this,” I say forcefully, pointing at him. “No more\n\nunauthorized changes, and no more undisclosed changes during outages.\n\nCan you get your people under control or not?”\n\nWes looks surprised and studies my face for a moment. “Yeah, I’m on it,\n\nboss.”\n\nWes and I spend nearly every waking hour late Tuesday and early\n\nWednesday in the Phoenix war room. The deployment is only three days\n\naway. As each day goes by, the worse it looks.\n\nIt’s a relief to head back to the Change Coordination Room.\n\nAs I walk in, most of the CAB is here. The messy pile of index cards is\n\ngone. Instead, they’re either hanging on one of the whiteboards on the wall\n\nor neatly organized on the table in the front of the room, labeled “Pending\n\nChanges.”\n\n“Welcome to our change management meeting,” Patty begins. “As you\n\ncan see on the board, all of the standard changes have been scheduled.\n\nToday, we’ll review and schedule all the high- and medium-risk changes.\n\nWe’ll then look at the change schedule to make any needed adjustments—I\n\nwon’t give away anything right now, but I think you’ll see something that\n\nrequires our attention.”\n\nShe picks up the first pile of cards. “The first high-risk change is to a\n\nfirewall, submitted by John, scheduled for Friday.” She then reads out the\n\npeople who have been consulted and signed off on the proposed change.\n\nShe prompts Wes and me, “Bill and Wes, do you approve this to go on\n\nthe board as a Friday change?”\n\nI’m satisfied that there have been enough eyes on this, so I nod.\n\nWes says, “Same for me. Hey, not bad. Twenty-three seconds to approve\n\nour first change. We beat our previous best time by fifty-nine minutes!”\n\nThere is scattered applause. Patty doesn’t disappoint as she goes through\n\nthe remaining eight high-risk changes, taking even less time for those.\n\nThere is more applause, while one of her staff posts the cards on the board.\n\nPatty picks up the medium-risk change stack. “There were 147 standard\n\nchanges submitted. I want to commend everyone for following the process\n\nand talking with the people that needed to be consulted. Ninety of those\n\nchanges are ready to be scheduled, and have been posted. I’ve printed them\n\nout for everyone to review.”\n\nTurning to Wes and me, she says, “I sampled ten percent of these, and,\n\nfor the most part, they look good. I’ll keep track of problem trends, just in\n\ncase some of these need more scrutiny going forward. Unless there are any\n\nobjections, I think we’re done with the medium-risk changes. There’s\n\nactually a more pressing problem that we need to address.”\n\nWhen Wes says, “No objections from me,” I nod for Patty to proceed,\n\nwho merely gestures to the boards.\n\nI think I see what’s wrong, but I stay quiet. One of the leads points to\n\none of the boxes and says, “How many changes are scheduled for Friday?”\n\nBingo.\n\nPatty flashes a small smile and says, “173.”\n\nOn the board, it’s now very obvious that nearly half the changes were\n\nscheduled for Friday. Of the remaining, half are scheduled for Thursday\n\nwith the rest sprinkled earlier in the week.\n\nShe continues, “I’m not suggesting that 173 changes happening on\n\nFriday is bad, but I’m worried about change collisions and resource-\n\navailability conflicts. Friday is also the day Phoenix is being deployed.\n\n“If I were air traffic control,” she continues, “I’d say that the airspace is\n\ndangerously overcrowded. Anyone willing to change their flight plans?”\n\nSomeone says, “I’ve got three that I’d like to do today, if no one minds.\n\nI don’t want to be anywhere near the airport when Phoenix comes in for a\n\nlanding.”\n\n“Yeah, well, lucky you,” Wes mutters. “Some of us have to be here on\n\nFriday. I can already see the flames pouring out of the wings…”\n\nTwo other engineers ask for their changes to be moved earlier in the\n\nweek. Patty has them go to the board to move their change cards, verifying\n\nthat it wouldn’t interfere with other changes already scheduled.\n\nFifteen minutes later, the distribution of the cards on the change board is\n\nmuch more even. I’m less happy that everyone is moving their changes as\n\nfar away from Friday as possible, like woodland creatures running away\n\nfrom a forest fire.\n\nWatching the change cards being moved around, something else starts to\n\nbother me. It’s not just the images of carnage and mayhem around Phoenix.\n\nInstead, it has something to do with Erik and the MRP-8 plant. I keep staring\n\nat the cards.\n\nPatty interrupts my concentration. “—Bill, that concludes what we\n\nneeded to get through. All the changes for the week are approved and\n\nscheduled.”\n\nAs I try to reorient myself, Wes says, “You’ve done a really great job\n\norganizing this, Patty. You know I was one of your louder critics. But…”\n\nHe gestures at the board, “All this is just terrific.”\n\nThere is a murmur of agreement, and Patty flushes visibly. “Thanks.\n\nWe’re still in our first week of having a real change process, and this is the\n\nbroadest participation we’ve ever had. But before we start patting ourselves\n\non the back, how about we make it to a second week, okay?”\n\nI say, “Absolutely. Thanks for all the time you’re putting into this, Patty.\n\nKeep up the great work.”\n\nWhen the meeting adjourns, I stay behind, staring at the change board.\n\nSeveral times during this meeting, something flickered at the edge of my\n\nmind. Was it something that Erik said that I dismissed earlier? Something to\n\ndo with work?\n\nLast Thursday, Wes and Patty did a manual inventory of all our projects,\n\ncoming up with nearly a hundred projects. It was manually generated by\n\ninterviewing all the line workers. Those projects certainly represent two\n\ncategories of work: business projects and internal IT projects.\n\nLooking at all the change cards on the wall, I realize that I’m looking at\n\nanother collection of work that we once again manually generated.\n\nAccording to Patty, it’s 437 discrete pieces of…work…that we’re doing this\n\nweek.\n\nI realize that changes are the third category of work.\n\nWhen Patty’s people moved around the change cards, from Friday to\n\nearlier in the week, they were changing our work schedule. Each of those\n\nchange cards defined the work that my team was going to be doing that day.\n\nSure, each of these changes is much smaller than an entire project, but\n\nit’s still work. But what is the relationship between changes and projects?\n\nAre they equally important?\n\nAnd can it really be that before today, none of these changes were being\n\ntracked somewhere, in some sort of system? For that matter, where did all\n\nthese changes come from?\n\nIf changes are a type of work different than projects, does that mean that\n\nwe’re actually doing more than just the hundred projects? How many of\n\nthese changes are to support one of the hundred projects? If it’s not\n\nsupporting one of those, should we really be working on it?\n\nIf we had exactly the amount of resources to take on all our project\n\nwork, does this mean we might not have enough cycles to implement all\n\nthese changes?\n\nI debate with myself whether I’m on the verge of some large and\n\nmeaningful insight. Erik asked me what my organization’s equivalent to the\n\njob release desk on the plant floor. Does change management have anything\n\nto do with it?\n\nSuddenly I laugh out loud at the absurd number of questions I’ve just\n\nasked myself. I feel like a one-man debate club. Or that Erik tricked me into\n\ndoing some philosophical navel-gazing.\n\nThinking for a moment, I decide there’s value in knowing that changes\n\nrepresent yet another category of work but don’t know why.\n\nI’ve now identified three of the four categories of work. For a brief\n\nmoment, I wonder what the fourth category of work is.\n\nChapter 10 • Thursday, September 11\n\nThe next morning, bright and early, I’m back in the Phoenix war room.\n\nKirsten gives us a rundown of the most critical Phoenix project tasks at the\n\nbeginning of each day. Because the stakes are so high, committed tasks are\n\nusually reported by the responsible manager as “completed.”\n\nNo one wants to get on Kirsten’s bad side. Or Steve’s, for that matter.\n\nThe bad news of the day comes from William Mason, Director of\n\nQuality Assurance, who works for Chris. Apparently, they’re still finding\n\ntwice as many broken features as are getting fixed.\n\nIt’s never a good sign when pieces are falling off the car as it moves\n\ndown the assembly line. No wonder all of us are dreading the deployment\n\ndate.\n\nI’m pondering how we can mitigate some of this risk when I hear\n\nKirsten call Brent’s name for the third time. And for the third time, Wes is\n\nhaving to explain why something didn’t get done.\n\nSarah says from the back of the room, “Wes, once again we’re getting\n\nbottlenecked by your people. Are there some personnel issues here that you\n\nneed to be addressing?”\n\nWes turns bright red and is about to respond, when I quickly interject,\n\n“Kirsten, how many other tasks have been assigned to Brent?”\n\nKirsten quickly replies, “As of today, there are five outstanding tasks.\n\nThree were assigned last Wednesday, and two were assigned last Friday.”\n\n“Okay, I’m on it,” I say. “As soon as we’re done here, I’ll look into\n\nwhat’s going on. Expect a status report by noon today along with revised",

      "content": "timelines for completion. I’ll let you know if we require anything.”\n\nOn my walk over to Brent’s cube in Building 7, I remind myself that my\n\ngoal is to observe and seek to understand. After all, this guy has come up in\n\nconversation every day since I accepted my new role.\n\nMaybe Brent isn’t actually as smart as we think. Or perhaps he is some\n\ntechnology Einstein and any attempt to find similarly skilled people will\n\nfail. Or maybe he’s deliberately sabotaging our attempts to take work away\n\nfrom him.\n\nBut Brent seems professional and smart, not much different than many\n\nsenior engineers I’ve worked with in the past.\n\nAs I approach his desk, I hear him on the phone and typing away on his\n\nkeyboard. He’s sitting down in front of his four monitors with a headset on,\n\ntyping something into a terminal application.\n\nI remain standing outside of his cube, discreetly listening in.\n\nHe says, “No, no, no. The database is up and running. Yeah, I know\n\nbecause it’s right in front of me… Yes, I can do queries… Yes… Yes…\n\nNo… I’m telling you, it has to be the application server… It’s up? Okay, let\n\nme see… Wait, let me try doing a manual sync. Try it now…”\n\nHis cell phone rings. “Wait a second, I’ve got another call coming in. I’ll\n\ncall you right back.”\n\nHe writes something down on a Post-it note, putting it on his monitor\n\nnext to two other Post-it notes. Exasperated, he answers his cell phone,\n\n“Yeah, Brent here… The what service is down? Have you tried rebooting\n\nit? Look, I’m really slammed right now with Phoenix—I’ll get back to you\n\nlater today?”\n\nI’m in the middle of silently congratulating him when I hear him say,\n\n“Uh-huh…I don’t even know who that is. The VP of what? Okay, let me\n\nhave a look.”\n\nI sigh, taking a seat in an empty cubicle to watch today’s episode of A\n\nDay in The Life of Brent.\n\nHe’s on the phone for another five minutes, hanging up only after some\n\ncritical production database is back up and running.\n\nI appreciate how Brent seems to genuinely care that everyone relying on\n\nIT systems can get their work done, but I’m dismayed that everyone seems\n\nto be using him as their free, personal Geek Squad. At the expense of\n\nPhoenix.\n\nBrent grabs one of the Post-it notes off of his monitor and picks up his\n\nphone. Before he can dial, though, I stand up and say, “Hi, Brent.”\n\n“Jesus Christ!” he says, startled. “How long have you been there?”\n\n“Only for a couple of minutes,” I say, putting on my most friendly\n\nsmile, grabbing a seat next to him. “Long enough to see you fix two\n\npeople’s problems. That’s admirable, but I just came from Kirsten’s daily\n\nPhoenix stand-up. There are five tasks that have been assigned to you,\n\nwhich are now late.”\n\nI show him the five tasks from the project management meeting. He\n\nsays quickly, “I’m half-done with all of these already. I just need a couple of\n\nhours of quiet working time to get this done. I’d do this from home if I\n\ncould, but the network connection is too slow.”\n\n“Who’s been calling you, and what do they want?” I ask, frowning.\n\n“Usually it’s other IT people who are having problems fixing\n\nsomething,” he replies, rolling his eyes. “When something goes down, I’m\n\napparently the only person who knows where to go looking.”\n\n“I thought Wes hired a bunch of people to take over some of these\n\nescalations from you.” I say.\n\nBrent rolls his eyes again. “That was the idea. But most had other\n\nresponsibilities and were never available when we needed them. Others\n\nwere let go during the downsizings because they weren’t busy enough.\n\nTrust me. That was no big loss. I ended up handling most of those issues\n\nanyway.”\n\n“How many calls are you getting each day? Are you logging these calls\n\nanywhere?” I ask.\n\n“You mean, like in our ticketing system? No, because opening up a\n\nticket for each of those calls would take longer than fixing the problem.”\n\nBrent says dismissively. “The number of calls depends on the day. The last\n\nweek has been worse than normal.”\n\nI get it now. I bet if anyone called right now and yelled loud enough or\n\nname-dropped someone scary enough, Brent could be dragged into fixing\n\nsomeone else’s problem for hours on end.\n\n“You tried to push back on the last person who called. What made you\n\ndecide to work the issue, instead of telling them to go pound sand?” I ask.\n\nHe replies, “She told me that the VP of Logistics was screaming that\n\nreplenishment orders weren’t getting created, and that if it didn’t get fixed\n\nright away, our stores were at risk of stocking out on fast-moving products.\n\nI didn’t want to be the person being called out for single-handedly allowing\n\nstock-outs to happen in the stores.”\n\nI purse my lips. Company executives strong-arming my engineers into\n\ndoing their bidding is total bullshit. But jeopardizing Phoenix is above their\n\npay grade.\n\nStanding up, I say, “Okay, from here on out, you’re working only on\n\nPhoenix. Steve Masters has said that this is everyone’s top priority. Now\n\nmore than ever, the project needs you. I’m expecting you to reject any task\n\nthat anyone tries to assign you.”\n\nBrent looks simultaneously relieved and concerned. Maybe he’s\n\nthinking about that VP of Logistics.\n\nI add, “If anyone contacts you about anything besides Phoenix, send\n\nthem to Wes. Let him deal with all the jackasses.”\n\nHe says skeptically, “Look, I appreciate this, but I really don’t think this\n\nis going to work in the long run. Our guys around here just don’t seem up-\n\nto-speed with how all our systems work. In the end, they keep coming to\n\nme.”\n\n“Well, they’re going to have to learn. When they call, send them to Wes.\n\nIf anyone’s got a problem with that, then send them to me. In fact, put a\n\nvacation message on your e-mail, saying that you’re not responding to\n\nanything except for Phoenix and to instead contact…”\n\nAt my prompting, Brent says with a small smile, “Wes.”\n\n“See? You’re already getting the hang of it.” I smile in return.\n\nI point to his desk phone, “Do whatever it takes to break people of the\n\nhabit of going directly to you. You’ve got my permission to turn off your\n\nphone ringer and change your voicemail greeting to say you’re not available\n\nand to contact Wes instead. Whatever it takes.”\n\nRealizing that I’m distracting Brent from Phoenix by just standing here,\n\nI say quickly, “No, I’ll have my assistant Ellen change your voicemail\n\ngreeting for you.”\n\nBrent smiles again, and says, “No, no, no. I can do that. Thanks for the\n\noffer, though.”\n\nI write my cell phone number on a Post-it note, and hand it to him,\n\n“Ellen will do it. We need you on those Phoenix tasks. Call if you need\n\nanything from me.”\n\nWhen he nods, I start heading back to Building 9, but then turn around\n\nto ask, “Hey, let me buy you a beer sometime next week?”\n\nHe agrees, his expression brightening.\n\nAs I leave the building, I immediately call Patty. When she picks up, I\n\nsay, “Grab Wes and meet me outside the Phoenix war room. We need to\n\nchange the way we’re managing escalations to Brent. Right now.”\n\nWe all sit down in the conference room across the hallway from the Phoenix\n\nwar room.\n\n“How’d it go with Brent?” Wes asks.\n\nWhen I tell him that Brent wasn’t able to work on Phoenix because of\n\nall the break-fix work, he blanches. “He’s been in all these emergency\n\nmeetings! How can he possibly think anything is more important than\n\nPhoenix!”\n\nI say, “Good question. Why would Brent drop Phoenix to work on\n\nsomething else?”\n\nWes’ bluster disappears for a couple of moments. “Probably because\n\nsomeone like me was screaming at him, saying that I absolutely needed his\n\nhelp to get my most important task done. And it’s probably true: For way\n\ntoo many things, Brent seems to be the only one who knows how they\n\nactually work.”\n\n“If it were me, I’d try to justify it by saying that it would only take a\n\ncouple of minutes…” Patty says. “Which could be true, but it’s like death\n\nby a thousand cuts.”\n\n“Processes are supposed to protect people. We need to figure out how to\n\nprotect Brent,” I say. I then describe how I already told Brent to send\n\neveryone wanting anything to Wes.\n\n“What? You want me to micromanage all of his time? I don’t have time\n\nto be Brent’s secretary or be some sort of help desk person!” he shouts.\n\n“Okay, what’s on your plate that’s more important than making sure\n\nyour resources are getting critical Phoenix work done?” I ask.\n\nWes looks back at me for several moments stonily and then laughs.\n\n“Okay, you got me. Look, Brent is a smart guy. But he’s also one of the\n\nworst people I’ve ever met at writing anything down. Let me tell you a real\n\nstory of how impossible this is going to be: Several months ago, we were\n\nthree hours into a Sev 1 outage, and we bent over backward not to escalate\n\nto Brent. But eventually, we got to a point where we were just out of ideas,\n\nand we were starting to make things worse. So, we put Brent on the\n\nproblem.”\n\nHe shakes his head, recalling the memory, “He sat down at the\n\nkeyboard, and it’s like he went into this trance. Ten minutes later, the\n\nproblem is fixed. Everyone is happy and relieved that the system came back\n\nup. But then someone asked, ‘How did you do it?’ And I swear to God,\n\nBrent just looked back at him blankly and said, ‘I have no idea. I just did\n\nit.’”\n\nWes thumps the table and says, “And that is the problem with Brent.\n\nHow the hell do you document that? ‘Close your eyes and go into a\n\ntrance’?”\n\nPatty laughs, apparently recalling the story. She says, “I’m not\n\nsuggesting Brent is doing this deliberately, but I wonder whether Brent\n\nviews all his knowledge as a sort of power. Maybe some part of him is\n\nreluctant to give that up. It does put him in this position where he’s virtually\n\nimpossible to replace.”\n\n“Maybe. Maybe not,” I say. “I’ll tell you what I do know, though. Every\n\ntime that we let Brent fix something that none of us can replicate, Brent gets\n\na little smarter, and the entire system gets dumber. We’ve got to put an end\n\nto that.\n\n“Maybe we create a resource pool of level 3 engineers to handle the\n\nescalations, but keep Brent out of that pool. The level 3s would be\n\nresponsible for resolving all incidents to closure, and would be the only\n\npeople who can get access to Brent—on one condition.\n\n“If they want to talk with Brent, they must first get Wes’ or my\n\napproval,” I say. “They’d be responsible for documenting what they\n\nlearned, and Brent would never be allowed to work on the same problem\n\ntwice. I’d review each of the issues weekly, and if I find out that Brent\n\nworked a problem twice, there will be hell to pay. For both the level 3s and\n\nBrent.”\n\nI add, “Based on Wes’ story, we shouldn’t even let Brent touch the\n\nkeyboard. He’s allowed to tell people what to type and shoulder-surf, but\n\nunder no condition will we allow him to do something that we can’t\n\ndocument afterward. Is that clear?”\n\n“That’s great,” Patty says. “At the end of each incident, we’ll have one\n\nmore article in our knowledge base of how to fix a hairy problem and a\n\ngrowing pool of people who can execute the fix.”\n\nWes doesn’t look completely convinced, but he eventually laughs. “I\n\nlike it, too. We’ll treat him like Hannibal Lecter—when we need him, we’ll\n\nput him into a straightjacket, tie him to a wheelchair, and cart him out.”\n\nI laugh.\n\nPatty adds, “To prevent another Brent escalation, we should log every\n\nkeystroke and record the terminal session. Maybe even have someone\n\nfollow him around with a video camera and turn on audit logging so we\n\nknow exactly what he changed.”\n\nI like it, although it sounds a bit extreme. However, I suspect that it will\n\ntake extreme measures to get us out of this situation.\n\nI venture, “Maybe we take away his production access, so the only way\n\nthe work can get done is him telling the level 3s what to do.”\n\nWes guffaws. “He might quit if we did that right away.”\n\n“So, who do we have that’s available to put into this level 3 resource\n\npool?” I ask.\n\nHe hesitates. “Well, we have the two hires we made a year ago that were\n\nmeant to help shore up Brent. One is working on creating server build\n\nstandards, but we can take her off of that temporarily. There are two other\n\nengineers that we identified for cross-training years ago, but we never had\n\nthe time to pursue it further. So, that’s three people.”\n\n“I’ll define the new Brent procedures,” Patty says. “I like gating all\n\naccess to him through you and Wes. But how will we discourage people like\n\nthat VP of Logistics from going directly to Brent?”\n\nI reply immediately, “We’ll collect the names of the people who do, and\n\nI’ll call each of their bosses to tell them to cease and desist. And then I’ll let\n\nSteve know how they’re disrupting Phoenix.”\n\n“Okay, let’s give it a try,” she says. “You know, we’ve got the ‘stick’\n\napproach covered, but what about the ‘carrot’? How can we motivate Brent\n\nand the engineers to follow this new process?”\n\n“Maybe we send them to whatever conference or training they want.\n\nWhen senior engineers get to the level of Brent, or aspire to be Brent, they\n\nwant to learn and share what they’ve done. As for Brent, how about we\n\nmake him take a week off, completely free of any escalation duties?” Wes\n\nsuggests.\n\n“My God,” Wes continues, shaking his head. “I don’t think Brent’s even\n\nbeen able to take a day off without a pager in about three years. You know,\n\nhe’ll burst into tears when we offer that to him.”\n\n“Make it so, guys,” I say, smiling as I imagine that scene.\n\nBefore I forget, I add, “Wes, I want a timesheet from Brent every day,\n\nand I want every escalation Brent works in the ticketing system. We need\n\nthat documented so we can analyze it later. Anyone using Brent’s time will\n\nneed to justify it to me. If it’s not justified, I’ll escalate it to Steve, and that\n\nperson and his manager will have to explain to Steve why they think their\n\nproject or task is so important.”\n\n“This is amazing,” Patty says. “We’ve gotten more change, incident, and\n\nescalation processes going in the last week than we have in the last five\n\nyears!”\n\n“It’s probably just in the nick of time,” Wes says, sounding relieved.\n\n“Do me a favor, and don’t tell anyone I said that. I’ve got a reputation to\n\nprotect.”\n\nChapter 11 • Thursday, September 11\n\nLater that day during lunch, I curse loudly. I was trying to use my precious\n\nfew unscheduled minutes during my break to get caught up on e-mails but\n\nforgot that my crappy laptop crashes if I turn it on while it’s in the docking\n\nstation. It’s the third time I’ve done it this week.\n\nI’m already eating late and half my lunch break will be gone by the time\n\nI can log on.\n\nLooking around, I find a blank Post-it note on my desk and write in\n\nlarge letters, “DO NOT INSERT LAPTOP UNTIL POWERED ON!!!” and put it on the\n\ndocking station to avert my next act of time-wasting stupidity.\n\nI’m smiling at my countermeasure when Patty calls me on my cell\n\nphone. “You have a minute to talk? I’m seeing something very odd on the\n\nchange calendar. You need to see this.”\n\nWhen I walk into the conference room, I see the now familiar change\n\ncards hanging on the wall. The inbox basket is full of cards and more are\n\nneatly stacked in piles on the table. Patty is scrutinizing something on her\n\nlaptop, chewing a fingernail.\n\nLooking exhausted, she says, “I’m starting to think this entire change\n\nprocess is a total waste of time. Organizing all these changes and managing\n\nall the stakeholder communication is taking up three people full-time.\n\nBased on what I’m seeing now, it may be useless.”\n\nTo see her suddenly disparaging the processes she has championed for\n\nyears is genuinely alarming.",

What has you so concerned?”\n\nShe points to the Monday and Tuesday change boxes. “At the end of\n\neach day, my people start closing out the scheduled changes. We wanted to\n\nmake sure that any changes that weren’t completed were flagged so they\n\ncan be rescheduled and to make sure that our change calendar was tracking\n\nwhat was happening in reality.”\n\nShe points to the corner of one card. “We put a check on the change\n\ncards that have been verified as completed and then indicate whether it\n\ncaused a service incident or outage. Since last Friday, sixty percent of the\n\nscheduled changes didn’t get implemented! Which means we’re doing all\n\nthis work to authorize and schedule these changes, only to find that they’re\n\nnot even getting done!”\n\nI can see why Patty is alarmed.\n\n“Why aren’t they being completed? And what do you do with the\n\nincomplete change cards?” I ask.\n\nShe scratches her head. “I’ve called a bunch of the change requesters,\n\nand their reasons are all over the board. A couple people said that they\n\ncouldn’t get all the people they needed to start their change. Someone else\n\ndiscovered halfway through his change that the storage guys didn’t finish\n\nexpanding the SAN like they had promised, so he had to back out his change,\n\ntwo hours into the procedure.”\n\nI groan, thinking about the wasted time and effort. I keep listening as\n\nPatty continues, “Someone else said that she couldn’t implement her change\n\nbecause there was an outage in progress. And a bunch of other people said,\n\num…”\n\nShe looks uncomfortable, so I prompt her to continue. “Well, they said\n\nthey needed Brent for a portion of their changes, and he wasn’t available,”\n\nshe says reluctantly. “In some cases, Brent’s involvement was planned. But\n\nin other cases, they discovered they needed his help only after they started\n\nimplementing and had to abort when Brent wasn’t available.”\n\nBefore Patty is even finished speaking, I’m seeing red.\n\n“Goddamnit! Brent again? What is going on? Just how has Brent\n\nmanaged to wedge himself into everyone’s path?\n\n“Oh, shit!” I exclaim when it hits me what’s happening. “Did we create\n\nthis problem by focusing Brent solely on Phoenix? Is this new policy a\n\nmistake?”\n\nShe says after a moment, “You know, that’s an interesting question. If\n\nyou genuinely believe that Brent should only be working on the most\n\nimportant projects, then I think the new policy is correct, and we shouldn’t\n\nchange it back.\n\n“I think it’s also important to note that until recently, Brent was helping\n\npeople implement their changes, without that dependency recorded\n\nanywhere. Or rather, he’d try to. But he’d invariably be too busy to help\n\neveryone, so many of these changes wouldn’t have been completed, even in\n\nthe old way.”\n\nI pick up my phone and speed-dial Wes, telling him to join us.\n\nWhen he arrives a couple of moments later, he takes a seat and then\n\nlooks at my old laptop, saying, “Jeez. You still carrying that thing around?\n\nI’m sure we have a couple of newer eight-year-old laptops that you could\n\nuse.”\n\nIgnoring his comment, Patty quickly brings him up to speed. His\n\nreaction to her revelation isn’t much different than mine.\n\n“You’ve got to be kidding me!” he says angrily, slapping his palm on his\n\nforehead. “Maybe we should allow Brent to help people make changes?”\n\nI quickly say, “No, that can’t be the answer. I suggested that, too. But\n\nPatty pointed out that this would imply that the blocked changes are more\n\nimportant than Phoenix. Which they aren’t.”\n\nI think aloud, “Somehow, just like we’re breaking the habits of people\n\nasking Brent to help with break-fix work, we need to do the same with\n\nchange implementation. We’ve got to get all this knowledge into the hands\n\nof people actually doing the work. If they can’t grok it, then maybe we have\n\na skills problem in those teams.”\n\nWhen no one says anything, I tentatively add, “How about we take those\n\nsame level 3 engineers that are dedicated to protect Brent from break-fix to\n\nhelp with these change issues?”\n\nWes quickly responds, “Maybe. But it’s not a long-term fix. We need the\n\npeople doing the work to know what the hell they’re doing, not enable more\n\npeople to hoard knowledge.”\n\nI listen to Wes and Patty brainstorm ideas to reduce yet another\n\ndependency on Brent when something starts to bother me. Erik called WIP,\n\nor work in process, the “silent killer,” and that inability to control WIP on the\n\nplant floor was one of the root causes for chronic due-date problems and\n\nquality issues.\n\nWe just discovered that sixty percent of our changes didn’t complete as\n\nscheduled.\n\nErik had pointed to the ever-growing mountain of work on the plant\n\nfloor as an indication that the plant floor managers had failed to control\n\ntheir work in process.\n\nI look at the mountain of change cards piled up on today’s date on the\n\ncalendar, as if a giant snowplow had pushed them all forward. Suddenly, it’s\n\nstarting to seem like the picture Erik painted on the plant floor eerily\n\ndescribes the state of my organization.\n\nCan IT work really be compared to work on a plant floor?\n\nPatty interrupts my deep contemplation as she asks, “What do you\n\nthink?”\n\nI look back up at her. “For the last couple of days, only forty percent of\n\nthe scheduled changes were completed. The rest are being carried forward.\n\nLet’s assume that this continues for a bit longer, while we figure out how to\n\ndisseminate all the Brent knowledge.\n\n“We have 240 incomplete changes this week. If we have four hundred\n\nnew changes coming in next week, we’ll have 640 changes on the schedule\n\nnext week!\n\n“We’re like the Bates Motel of changes,” I say in disbelief. “Changes go\n\nin but never come out. Within a month, we’ll have thousands of changes\n\nthat we’ll be carrying around, all competing to get implemented.”\n\nPatty nods, “That’s exactly what’s bothering me. We don’t have to wait a\n\nmonth to see thousands of changes—we’re already tracking 942 changes.\n\nWe’ll cross over one thousand pending changes sometime next week. We’re\n\nrunning short of space to post and store these change cards. So why are we\n\ngoing through all this trouble if the changes aren’t even going to get\n\nimplemented!”\n\nI stare at all the cards, willing them into giving me an answer.\n\nAn ever-growing pile of inventory trapped on the plant floor, as high as\n\nthe forklifts could stack it.\n\nAn ever-growing pile of changes trapped inside of IT Operations, with us\n\nrunning out of space to post the change cards.\n\nWork piling up in front of the heat treat oven, because of Mark sitting at\n\nthe job release desk releasing work.\n\nWork piling up in front of Brent, because of…\n\nBecause of what?\n\nOkay, if Brent is our heat treat oven, then who is our Mark? Who\n\nauthorized all this work to be put in the system?\n\nWell, we did. Or rather, the CAB did.\n\nCrap. Does that mean we did this to ourselves?\n\nBut changes need to get done, right? That’s why they’re changes.\n\nBesides, how do you say no to the onslaught of incoming work?\n\nLooking at the cards piling up, can we afford not to?\n\nBut when was the question ever asked whether we should accept the\n\nwork? And on what basis did we ever make that decision?\n\nAgain, I don’t know the answer. But, worse, I have a feeling that Erik\n\nmay not be a raving madman. Maybe he’s right. Maybe there is some sort\n\nof link between plant floor management and IT Operations. Maybe plant\n\nfloor management and IT Operations actually have similar challenges and\n\nproblems.\n\nI stand up and walk to the change board. I start thinking aloud, “Patty is\n\nalarmed that more than half our changes aren’t completing as scheduled, to\n\nthe extent that she’s wondering whether this whole change process is worth\n\nthe time we’re investing in it.\n\n“Furthermore,” I continue, “she points out that a significant portion of\n\nthe changes can’t complete because Brent is somehow in the way, which is\n\npartially because we’ve directed Brent to reject all non-Phoenix work. We\n\nthink that reversing this policy is the wrong thing to do.”\n\nI take a mental leap, following my intuition. “And I’d bet a million\n\ndollars that this is the exact wrong thing to do. It’s because of this process\n\nthat, for the first time, we’re even aware of how much scheduled work isn’t\n\ngetting done! Getting rid of the process would just kill our situational\n\nawareness.”\n\nFeeling like I’m getting on a roll, I say adamantly, “Patty, we need a\n\nbetter understanding of what work is going to be heading Brent’s way. We\n\nneed to know which change cards involve Brent—maybe we even make\n\nthat another piece of information required when people submit their cards.\n\nOr use a different color card—you figure it out. You need to inventory what\n\nchanges need anything from Brent, and try to satisfy it instead with the\n\nlevel 3 engineers. Failing that, try to get them prioritized so we can triage\n\nthem with Brent.”\n\nAs I’m talking, I’m more confident that we’re heading down the right\n\npath. At this point, we might not be fixing the problem, but at least we’ll be\n\ngetting some data.\n\nPatty nods, her expression of concern and despair now gone. “You want\n\nme to get my arms around the changes that are heading to Brent, indicating\n\nthem on the change cards and maybe even requiring this information on all\n\nnew cards. And to get back to you when we know how many changes are\n\nBrent-bound, what the changes are, and so forth, along with a sense of what\n\nthe priorities are. Did I get that right?”\n\nI nod and smile.\n\nShe types away on her laptop. “Okay, I’ve got it. I’m not sure what we’ll\n\nfind out, but it’s better than anything I came up with by a long shot.”\n\nI look over at Wes, “You look concerned—anything you want to share?”\n\n“Uh…” Wes says eventually. “There’s not much to share, really. Except\n\nthat this is a very different way of working than anything I’ve seen in IT. No\n\noffense, but did you switch medication recently?”\n\nI smile wanly, “No, but I did have a conversation with a raving madman\n\non a catwalk overlooking the manufacturing plant floor.”\n\nBut if Erik was right about WIP in IT Operations, what else was he right\n\nabout?\n\nChapter 12 • Friday, September 12\n\nIt’s 7:30 p.m. on Friday, two hours after the Phoenix deployment was\n\nscheduled to start. And things are not going well. I’m starting to associate\n\nthe smell of pizza with the futility of a death march.\n\nThe entire IT Operations team was assembled in preparation for the\n\ndeployment at 4 p.m. But there was nothing to do because we hadn’t\n\nreceived anything from Chris’ team; they were still making last minute\n\nchanges.\n\nIt’s not a good sign when they’re still attaching parts to the space shuttle\n\nat liftoff time.\n\nAt 4:30 p.m., William had stormed into the Phoenix war room, livid and\n\ndisgusted that no one could get all of the Phoenix code to run in the test\n\nenvironment. Worse, the few parts of Phoenix that were running were\n\nfailing critical tests.\n\nWilliam started sending back critical bug reports to the developers,\n\nmany of whom had already gone home for the day. Chris had to call them\n\nback in, and William’s team had to wait for the developers to send them\n\nnew versions.\n\nMy team wasn’t just sitting around, twiddling our thumbs. Instead, we\n\nwere frantically working with William’s team to try to get all of Phoenix to\n\ncome up in the test environment. Because if they couldn’t get things\n\nrunning in a test environment, we wouldn’t have a prayer of being able to\n\ndeploy and run it in production.",

      "content": "My gaze shifts from the clock to the conference table. Brent and three\n\nother engineers are huddling with their QA counterparts. They’ve been\n\nworking frantically since 4 p.m., and they already look haggard. Many have\n\nlaptops open to Google searches, and others are systematically fiddling with\n\nsettings for the servers, operating systems, databases, and the Phoenix\n\napplication, trying to figure out how to bring everything up, which the\n\ndevelopers had assured them was possible.\n\nOne of the developers had actually walked in a couple of minutes ago\n\nand said, “Look, it’s running on my laptop. How hard can it be?”\n\nWes started swearing, while two of our engineers and three of William’s\n\nengineers started poring through the developer’s laptop, trying to figure out\n\nwhat made it different from the test environment.\n\nIn another area of the room, an engineer is talking heatedly to somebody\n\non the phone, “Yes, we copied the file that you gave us… Yes, it’s version\n\n1.0.13… What do you mean it’s the wrong version… What? When did you\n\nchange that?… Copy it now and try again… Okay, look, but I’m telling you\n\nthis isn’t going to work… I think it’s a networking problem… What do you\n\nmean we need to open up a firewall port? Why the hell didn’t you tell us\n\nthis two hours ago? Goddamnit!”\n\nHe then slams the phone down hard, and then pounds the table with his\n\nfist, yelling, “Fucking developers!”\n\nBrent looks up from the developer laptop, rubbing his eyes with fatigue.\n\n“Let me guess. The front-end can’t talk to the database server because\n\nsomeone didn’t tell us we need to open a firewall port?”\n\nThe engineer nods with exhausted fury, and says, “I cannot freaking\n\nbelieve this. I was on the phone with that jackass for twenty minutes, and it\n\nnever occurred to him that it wasn’t a code problem. This is FUBAR.”\n\nI continue to listen quietly, but I’m nodding in agreement at his\n\nprognosis. In the Marines, we used the term FUBAR, meaning “fucked up\n\nbeyond all recognition.”\n\nWatching tempers fray, I look at my watch: 7:37 p.m.\n\nIt’s time to get a management gut check from my team. I round up Wes\n\nand Patty and look around for William. I find him staring over the shoulder\n\nof one of his engineers. I ask him to join us.\n\nHe looks puzzled for a moment, because we don’t normally interact, but\n\nhe nods and follows us to my office.\n\n“Okay, guys, tell me what you think of this situation,” I ask.\n\nWes speaks up first, “Those guys are right. This is FUBAR. We’re still\n\ngetting incomplete releases from the developers. In the past two hours, I’ve\n\nalready seen two instances when they’ve forgotten to give us several critical\n\nfiles, which guaranteed that the code wouldn’t run. And as you’ve seen, we\n\nstill don’t know how to configure the test environment so that Phoenix\n\nactually comes up cleanly.”\n\nHe shakes his head again. “Based on what I’ve seen in the last half hour,\n\nI think we’ve actually moved backward.”\n\nPatty just shakes her head with disgust and waves her hand, adding\n\nnothing.\n\nI say to William, “I know we haven’t worked much together, but I’d\n\nreally like to know what you think. How’s it looking from your\n\nperspective?”\n\nHe looks down, exhaling slowly and then says, “I honestly have no idea.\n\nThe code is changing so fast that we’re having problems keeping up. If I\n\nwere a betting man, I’d say Phoenix is going to blow up in production. I’ve\n\ntalked with Chris a couple of times about stopping the release, but he and\n\nSarah ran right over me.”\n\nI ask him, “What do you mean by you ‘can’t keep up’?”\n\n“When we find problems in our testing, we send it back to Development\n\nto have them fix it,” he explains. “Then they’ll send back a new release.\n\nThe problem is that it takes about a half hour to get everything set up and\n\nrunning, and then another three hours to execute the smoke test. In that\n\ntime, we’ll have probably gotten three more releases from Development.”\n\nI smirk at the reference to smoke tests, a term circuit designers use. The\n\nsaying goes, “If you turn the circuit board on and no smoke comes out, it’ll\n\nprobably work.”\n\nHe shakes his head and says, “We have yet to make it through the smoke\n\ntest. I’m concerned that we no longer have sufficient version control—\n\nwe’ve gotten so sloppy about keeping track of version numbers of the entire\n\nrelease. Each time they fix something, they’re usually breaking something\n\nelse. So, they’re sending single files over instead of the entire package.”\n\nHe continues, “It’s so chaotic right now that even if by some miracle\n\nPhoenix does pass the smoke test, I’m pretty sure we wouldn’t be able to\n\nreplicate it, because there are too many moving parts.”\n\nTaking off his glasses, he says with finality, “This is probably going to\n\nbe an all-nighter for everyone. I think there’s genuine risk that we won’t\n\nhave anything up and running at 8 a.m. tomorrow, when the stores open.\n\nAnd that’s a big problem.”\n\nThat is a huge understatement. If the release isn’t finished by 8 a.m., the\n\npoint of sale systems in the stores used to check out customers won’t work.\n\nAnd that means we won’t be able to complete customer transactions.\n\nWes is nodding. “William is right. We’re definitely going to be here all\n\nnight. And performance is worse than even I thought it would be. We’re\n\ngoing to need at least another twenty servers to spread the load, and I don’t\n\nknow where we can find so many on such short notice. I have some people\n\nscrambling to find any spare hardware. Maybe we’ll even have to\n\ncannibalize servers in production.”\n\n“Is it too late to stop the deployment?” I ask. “When exactly is the point\n\nof no return?”\n\n“That’s a very good question.” Wes answers slowly. “I’d have to check\n\nwith Brent, but I think we could stop the deployment now with no issues.\n\nBut when we start converting the database so it can take orders from both\n\nthe in-store POS systems and Phoenix, we are committed. At this rate, I don’t\n\nthink that will be for a couple of hours yet.”\n\nI nod. I’ve heard what I’ve needed to hear.\n\n“Guys, I’m going to send out an e-mail to Steve, Chris, and Sarah to see\n\nif I can delay the deployment. And then I’m going to find Steve. Maybe I\n\ncan get us one more week. But, hell, even getting one more day would be a\n\nwin. Any thoughts?”\n\nWes, Patty, and William all just shake their heads glumly, saying\n\nnothing.\n\nI turn to Patty. “Go work with William to figure out how we can get\n\nsome better traffic coordination in the releases. Get over to where the\n\ndevelopers are and play air traffic controller, and make sure everything is\n\nlabeled and versioned on their side. And then let Wes and team know what’s\n\ncoming over. We need better visibility and someone to keep people\n\nfollowing process over there. I want a single entry point for code drops,\n\ncontrolled hourly releases, documentation… Get my drift?”\n\nShe says, “It would be my pleasure. I’ll head up to the Phoenix war\n\nroom for starters. I’ll kick down the door if that’s what it takes and say,\n\n‘We’re here to help…’”\n\nI give them all a nod of thanks and head to my laptop to write my e-\n\nmail.\n\nFrom: Bill Palmer\n\nTo: Steve Masters\n\nCc: Chris Anderson, Wes Davis, Patty McKee, Sarah Moulton,\n\nWilliam Mason\n\nDate: September 12, 7:45 PM\n\nPriority: Highest\n\nSubject: URGENT: Phoenix deployment in major trouble—my\n\nrecommendation: 1 week delay\n\nSteve,\n\nFirst off, let me state that I want Phoenix in production as much as\n\nanyone else. I understand how important it is to the company.\n\nHowever, based on what I’ve seen, I believe we will not have\n\nPhoenix up by the tomorrow 8 AM deadline. There is SIGNIFICANT RISK\n\nthat this may even impact the in-store POS systems.\n\nAfter discussions with William I recommend that we delay the\n\nPhoenix launch by one week to increase the likelihood that Phoenix\n\nachieves its goals and avert what I believe will be a NEAR-CERTAIN\n\ndisaster.\n\nI think we’re looking at problems on the scale of the “November\n\n1999 Thanksgiving Toys R Us” train-wreck, meaning multiday\n\noutages and performance problems that potentially put customer and\n\norder data at risk.\n\nSteve, I will be calling you in just a couple of minutes.\n\nRegards,\n\nBill\n\nI take a moment to collect my thoughts and call Steve, who answers on the\n\nfirst ring.\n\n“Steve, it’s Bill. I just sent out an e-mail to you, Sarah, and Chris. I\n\ncannot overstate how badly this rollout has gone so far. This is going to bite\n\nus in the ass. Even William agrees. My team is now extremely concerned\n\nthat the rollout will not complete in time for the stores to open at 8 a.m.\n\nEastern time tomorrow. That could disrupt the stores’ ability to take sales,\n\nas well as probably cause multiday outages to the website.\n\n“It’s not too late to stop this train wreck,” I implore. “Failure means that\n\nwe’ll have problems taking orders from anyone, whether they’re in the\n\nstores or on the Internet. Failure could mean jeopardizing and screwing up\n\norder data and customer records, which means losing customers. Delaying\n\nby a week would just mean disappointing customers, but at least they’ll\n\ncome back!”\n\nSteve breathes into the phone and then replies, “It sounds bad, but at this\n\npoint, we don’t have a choice. We have to keep going. Marketing already\n\nbought weekend newspaper ads announcing the availability of Phoenix.\n\nThey’re bought, paid for, and being delivered to homes across the country.\n\nOur partners are all lined up and ready to go.”\n\nFlabbergasted, I say, “Steve, just how bad does it have to be for you to\n\ndelay this release? I’m telling you that we could be taking a reckless level\n\nof risk in this rollout!”\n\nHe pauses for several moments. “Tell you what. If you can convince\n\nSarah to postpone the rollout, let’s talk. Otherwise, keep pushing.”\n\n“Are you kidding me? She’s the one who’s created this kamikaze mess.\n\nGoddamnit!”\n\nBefore I can stop myself, I hang up on Steve. For a brief moment, I\n\nconsider calling him back to apologize.\n\nAs much as I hate to, I feel like I owe the company one last try to stop\n\nthis insanity. Which means talking to Sarah in person.\n\nBack in the Phoenix war room it’s stuffy and rank from too many people\n\nsweating from tension and fear. Sarah is sitting by herself, typing away on\n\nher laptop.\n\nI call out to her, “Sarah, can we talk?”\n\nShe gestures to the chair next to her, saying, “Sure. What’s up?”\n\nWhen I say in a lowered voice, “Let’s talk in the hallway.”\n\nAs we walk out together in silence, I ask her, “From up here, how does\n\nit look like the release is going?”\n\nShe says noncommittally, “You know how these things go when we’re\n\ntrying to be nimble, right? There’s always unforeseen things when it comes\n\nto technology. If you want to make omelets, you’ve got to be willing to\n\nbreak some eggs.”\n\n“I think it’s a bit worse than your usual rollout. I trust you saw my e-\n\nmail, right?”\n\nShe merely says, “Yes, of course. And you saw my reply?”\n\nShit.\n\nI say, “No. But, before you explain, I wanted to make sure you\n\nunderstood the implications and the risks we’re posing to the business.”\n\nAnd then I repeat almost word for word what I told Steve just minutes\n\nbefore.\n\nNot surprisingly, Sarah is unimpressed. As soon as I stop talking, she\n\nsays, “We’ve all been busting ass getting Phoenix this far. Marketing is\n\nready, Development is ready. Everyone is ready but you. I’ve told you\n\nbefore, but apparently, you’re not listening: Perfection is the enemy of\n\ngood. We’ve got to keep going.”\n\nMarveling at this colossal waste of time, I just shake my head and say,\n\n“No, lack of competence is the enemy of good. Mark my words. We’re\n\ngoing to be picking up the pieces for days, if not weeks, because of your\n\ndumb decisions.”\n\nAs I storm back into the NOC, I read Sarah’s e-mail, which makes me\n\neven more furious. I resist the urge to reply and add fuel to the fire. I also\n\nresist the emotional desire to delete it—I may need it to cover my ass later.\n\nFrom: Sarah Moulton\n\nTo: Bill Palmer, Steve Masters\n\nCc: Chris Anderson, Wes Davis, Patty McKee, William Mason\n\nDate: September 12, 8:15 PM\n\nPriority: Highest\n\nSubject: Re: URGENT: Phoenix deployment in major trouble—my\n\nrecommendation: 1 week delay\n\nEveryone is ready but you. Marketing, Dev, Project Management\n\nall have given this project their all. Now it’s your turn.\n\nWE MUST GO!\n\nSarah\n\nSuddenly, I panic for a brief moment that I haven’t told Paige anything for\n\nhours. I send her a quick text message:\n\nNight keeps getting worse. Am here for at least a couple more hrs. Will\n\ncatch u in am. Love you. Wish me luck, darling.\n\nI feel a tap on my shoulder and turn around to see Wes. “Boss. We’ve\n\ngot a very serious problem.”\n\nThe expression on his face is enough to make me scared. I quickly stand\n\nup and follow him to the other side of the room.\n\n“Remember when we hit the point of no return around 9 p.m.? I’ve been\n\ntracking the progress of the Phoenix database conversion, and it’s thousands\n\nof times slower than we thought it would be. It was supposed to complete\n\nhours ago, but it’s only ten percent complete. That means all the data won’t\n\nbe converted until Tuesday. We are totally screwed.”\n\nMaybe I’m more tired than I thought but I’m not following him. I say,\n\n“Why is this a problem?”\n\nWes tries again, “That script needs to complete before the POS systems\n\ncan come up. We can’t stop the script and we can’t restart it. Apparently,\n\nthere’s nothing we can do to make it go faster. I think we can hack Phoenix\n\nso that it can run, but I don’t know about the in-store POS systems—we\n\ndon’t have any to test with in the lab.”\n\nHoly crap.\n\nI think twice before I ask, “Brent?”\n\nHe just shakes his head. “I had him look at it for a couple of minutes. He\n\nthinks that someone turned on database indexing too soon, which is slowing\n\ndown the inserts. There’s nothing we can do about it now, though, without\n\nscrewing up data. I put him back on the Phoenix deployment.”\n\n“How is everything else going?” I ask, wanting a full assessment of the\n\nsituation. “Any improvement on performance? Any update on the database\n\nmaintenance tools?”\n\n“Performance is still terrible,” he says. “I think there’s a huge memory\n\nleak, and that’s even without any users on it. My guys suspect we’re going\n\nto have to reboot a bunch of the servers every couple of hours just to keep it\n\nfrom blowing up. Damned developers…”\n\nHe continues, “We’ve scrounged up fifteen more servers, some of them\n\nnew and some yanked from various corners of the company. And now,\n\nbelieve it or not, we don’t have enough space in the data center racks to\n\ndeploy them. We have to do a big recabling and racking job, moving crap\n\naround. Patty just put a call out and brought in a whole bunch of her people\n\nto help with that.”\n\nI feel my eyebrows hit my hairline in genuine surprise. And then I bend\n\nforward, laughing. I say, “Oh, dear God. We finally find servers to deploy,\n\nand now we can’t find space to put them in. Amazing. We just can’t get a\n\nbreak!”\n\nWes shakes his head. “You know, I’ve heard stories like this from my\n\nbuddies. But this may turn out to be the mother of all deployment failures.”\n\nHe continues, “Here’s the most amazing part: We made a huge\n\ninvestment in virtualization, which was supposed to save us from things\n\nlike this. But, when Development couldn’t fix the performance problems,\n\nthey blamed the virtualization. So we had to move everything back onto\n\nphysical servers!”\n\nAnd to think that Chris proposed this aggressive rollout date because\n\nvirtualization would save our asses.\n\nI wipe my eyes and force myself to stop laughing. “And how about the\n\ndatabase support tools the developers promised us?”\n\nWes immediately stops smiling. “Absolute garbage. Our guys are going\n\nto have to manually edit the database to correct all the errors Phoenix is\n\ngenerating. And we’re going to have to manually trigger replenishments.\n\nWe’re still learning about how much of this type of manual work Phoenix is\n\ngoing to require. It’s going to be very error-prone and take a ton of people\n\nto do.”\n\nI wince, thinking about how this will tie up even more of our guys,\n\ndoing menial work that the damned application should be doing. Nothing\n\nworries auditors more than direct edits of data without audit trails and\n\nproper controls.\n\n“You’re doing a great job here. Our top priority is finding out what the\n\neffect of the incomplete database conversion will be on the in-store POS\n\nsystem. Find someone who knows those things inside and out, and get their\n\nthoughts. If necessary, call someone on Sarah’s team who handles day-to-\n\nday retail operations. Bonus points if you can get your hands on a POS\n\ndevice and server we can log into to see what the impact is ourselves.”\n\n“Got it,” Wes says, nodding. “I know just the person to put on this.”\n\nI watch him head off and then look around, trying to figure out where I\n\ncan be the most useful.\n\nThe morning light is starting to stream in from the windows, showing the\n\naccumulated mess of coffee cups, papers, and all sorts of other debris. In the\n\ncorner, a developer is asleep under some chairs.\n\nI had just run to the bathroom to wash my face and wipe the grime from\n\nmy teeth. I feel a little fresher, but it’s been years since I’ve pulled an all-\n\nnighter.\n\nMaggie Lee is the Senior Director of Retail Program Management and\n\nworks for Sarah. She is kicking off the 7 a.m. emergency meeting, and there\n\nare nearly thirty people packed into the room. In a tired voice, she says,\n\n“It’s been a night of heroics, and I appreciate everyone doing what it takes\n\nto hit our Phoenix commitments.\n\n“As you know, the reason for this emergency meeting is that something\n\nwent wrong in the database conversion,” she continues. “That means all the\n\nin-store POS systems will be down, which means that the stores will not\n\nhave working cash registers. That means manual tills and manual card\n\nswipes.”\n\nShe adds, “The good news is that the Phoenix website is up and\n\nrunning.” She gestures at me and says, “My thanks to Bill and the entire IT\n\nOperations crew for making this happen.”\n\nIrritated, I say, “I’d far rather have those POS systems up instead of\n\nPhoenix. All hell is breaking loose in the NOC. All our phones have been lit\n\nup for the past hour, because people in the stores are all screaming that their\n\nsystems aren’t responding. It’s like the Jerry Lewis Telethon down there.\n\nLike all of you, my voicemail has already filled up from the staff in our 120\n\nstores. We’re going to need to pull in more people just to man the phones.”\n\nA phone vibrates somewhere on the table, as if to punctuate my point.\n\n“We need to get proactive here,” I say to Sarah. “We need to send out a\n\nsummary to everyone in the stores, as quickly as possible outlining what’s\n\nhappened and more specific instructions on how to conduct operations\n\nwithout the POS systems.”\n\nSarah momentarily looks blank, and then says, “That’s a good idea.\n\nHow about you take a first cut at the e-mail, and we’ll take it from there?”\n\nDumbfounded, I say, “What? I’m not a store manager! How about your\n\ngroup takes the first cut, and Chris and I can make sure it’s accurate.”\n\nChris nods.\n\nSarah looks around the room. “Okay. We’ll get something together in\n\nthe next couple of hours.”\n\n“Are you kidding me?” I shout. “Stores on the East Coast start opening\n\nin less than an hour—we need to get something out there now!”\n\n“I’ll take care of it,” says Maggie, raising her hand. She immediately\n\nopens up her laptop and starts typing.\n\nAs I squeeze my head between my hands to see if I can make my\n\nheadache hurt less, I wonder how much worse this rollout could get.\n\nBy 2 p.m. Saturday, it’s pretty clear that the bottom is a lot further down\n\nthan I thought possible.\n\nAll stores are now operating in total manual fallback mode. All sales are\n\nbeing processed by those manual credit card imprint machines, with the\n\ncarbon paper imprints being stored in shoeboxes.\n\nStore managers have had employees running to the local office supply\n\nstores to find more carbon paper slips for the card imprint machines, as well\n\nas to the bank, so they could give out correct change.\n\nCustomers using the Phoenix website are complaining about how it is\n\neither down or so slow as to be unusable. We have even managed to turn\n\ninto a Twitter trending topic. All of our customers who had been excited to\n\ntry our service started complaining about our big IT fail after seeing our TV\n\nand newspaper ads.\n\nThose customers who were able to order online had a rude awakening\n\nwhen they went to the store to pick up their order. That’s when we\n\ndiscovered that Phoenix seemed to be randomly losing transactions, and in\n\nother cases, it was double- or triple-charging our customers’ credit cards.\n\nFurious that we’ve potentially lost integrity of the sales order data, Ann\n\nfrom Finance drove in and her team has now set up another war room\n\nacross the hallway, fielding calls from the stores to handle problem orders.\n\nBy noon, there were piles of papers from hundreds of pissed off customers\n\nthat were being faxed in from the stores.\n\nTo support Ann, Wes brought in even more engineers to create some\n\ntools for Ann’s staff to use, in order to process the ever-growing backlog of\n\nscrewed up transactions.\n\nAs I walk past the NOC table for the third time, I decide that I’m too\n\nexhausted to be of use to anyone. It’s almost 2:30 p.m.\n\nWes is arguing with someone across the room, so I wait until he’s done.\n\nI say to him, “Let’s face up to the fact that this is going to be a multiday\n\nordeal. How are you holding up?”\n\nHe yawns and replies, “I managed to get an hour of sleep. Wow, you\n\nlook terrible. Go home and get a couple of hours yourself. I’ve got a handle\n\non everything here. I’ll call you if anything comes up.”\n\nToo tired to argue, I thank him and leave.\n\nI wake with a start when I hear my cell phone ring. I bolt up and grab my\n\nphone. It’s 4:30 p.m. Wes is calling.\n\nI shake my head to gain some semblance of alertness and then answer,\n\n“What’s up?”\n\nI hear him say, “Bad news. In short, it’s all over Twitter that the Phoenix\n\nwebsite is leaking customer credit card numbers. They’re even posting\n\nscreenshots. Apparently, when you empty your shopping cart, the session\n\ncrashes and displays the credit card number of the last successful order.”\n\nI’ve already jumped out of bed and am heading to the bathroom to get\n\nshowered. “Call John. He’s going to have kittens. There’s probably some\n\nprotocol for this, involving tons of paperwork and maybe even law\n\nenforcement. And probably lawyers, too.”\n\nWes replies, “I already called him. He and his team are on the way in.\n\nAnd he is pissed. He sounded just like that dude from Pulp Fiction. He even\n\nquoted the line about the day of reckoning and striking people down with\n\ngreat vengeance and furious anger.”\n\nI laugh. I love that scene with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. It’s\n\nnot how I would have typecast our mild-mannered CISO, but as they say, you\n\nalways have to watch out for the quiet ones.\n\nI take a quick shower. I run into the kitchen and grab a couple of sticks\n\nof the string cheese our son loves to eat. I take these with me in the car and\n\nstart my drive back into the office.\n\nWhen I get on the highway, I call Paige. She answers on the first ring,\n\n“Darling, where have you been? I’m at work and the kids are with my\n\nmom.”\n\nI say, “I was actually at home for an hour. I fell asleep the instant I\n\ncrawled into bed, but Wes just called. Apparently, the Phoenix application\n\nstarted showing the entire world people’s credit card numbers. It’s a huge\n\nsecurity breach, so I’m driving back in right now.”\n\nI hear her sigh disapprovingly. “You’ve been there for over ten years and\n\nyou’ve never worked these kind of hours. I’m really not sure I like this\n\npromotion.”\n\n“You and me both, honey…” I say.\n\nChapter 13 • Monday, September 15\n\nBy Monday, the Phoenix crisis is a public fiasco. We made it onto the front-\n\npage news of all the technology sites. There are rumors that someone from\n\nThe Wall Street Journal was trying to get Steve for an on-the-record\n\ninterview.\n\nI start with a jolt when I think I hear Steve mention my name.\n\nCompletely disoriented, I look around and realize that I’m at work and\n\nthat I must have fallen asleep while waiting for the Phoenix status meeting\n\nto start. I sneak a peek at my watch. 11:04 a.m.\n\nI have to look at my phone to figure out that it’s Monday.\n\nFor a moment, I wonder where my Sunday went, but seeing Steve red-\n\nfaced, and addressing the entire room makes me pay attention.\n\n“—don’t care a goddamned bit whose fault this is. You can bet your ass\n\nthat this won’t ever happen again on my watch. But right now, I don’t give\n\ntwo shits about the future—we are massively screwing our customers and\n\nshareholders. All I want to hear about is how we’re going to dig ourselves\n\nout of this hole and restore normal business operations.”\n\nHe turns and points at Sarah saying, “And you are not off the hook until\n\nevery one of your store managers says that they can transact normally.\n\nManual card swipes? What are we, in some Third World country?”\n\nSarah replies calmly, “I totally understand how unacceptable this is. I’m\n\nmaking sure my entire staff knows that they are accountable and\n\nresponsible.”",

      "content": "“No,” Steve responds quickly and gravely. “You are ultimately\n\naccountable and responsible. Do not forget that.”\n\nMy heart actually lightens for a moment, as I wonder whether Steve has\n\nbroken free of Sarah’s spell.\n\nTurning his attention back to the entire room he says gravely, “When the\n\nstore managers say that we’re no longer operating on life support, I need\n\nfifteen minutes from each and every person who had a hand in this. I expect\n\nyou to clear your calendar. No excuses.\n\n“That means you, Sarah, Chris, Bill, Kirsten, Ann. And even you, John,”\n\nhe says, pointing at people as he names them.\n\nWay to go, John. You picked a great time to finally get noticed by Steve.\n\nHe continues, “I’ll be back in two hours after I get on a phone call with\n\nanother goddamned journalist because of this mess!”\n\nHis door slam shakes the walls.\n\nSarah breaks the silence. “Well, you all heard Steve. Not only do we\n\nneed to get the POS systems up, but we must also get the Phoenix usability\n\nissues fixed. The press is having a heyday with the clunkiness of the\n\nordering interface and everything timing out.”\n\n“Are you out of your mind?” I say, leaning forward. “We are keeping\n\nPhoenix alive by sheer heroics. Wes wasn’t joking when he said that we’re\n\nproactively rebooting all the front-end servers every hour. We can’t\n\nintroduce any more instabilities. I propose code rollouts only twice a day\n\nand restricting all code changes to those affecting performance.”\n\nTo my surprise, Chris immediately chimes in, “I agree. William, what do\n\nyou think?”\n\nWilliam nods. “Absolutely. I suggest we announce to the developers that\n\nall code commits must have a defect number that corresponds to a\n\nperformance problem. Anything that doesn’t will get rejected.”\n\nChris says, “That good enough for you, Bill?”\n\nPleased with the solution, I say, “Perfect.”\n\nAlthough Wes and Patty seem simultaneously pleased and taken aback\n\nby this sudden cooperation from Development, Sarah is not pleased. She\n\nsays, “I don’t agree. We’ve got to be able to respond to the market, and the\n\nmarket is telling us that Phoenix is too hard to use. We can’t afford to screw\n\nthis up.”\n\nChris replies, “Look, the time for usability testing and validation was\n\nmonths ago. If we didn’t get it right the first time, we’re not going to get it\n\nright without some real work. Have your product managers work on their\n\nrevised mockups and proposals. We’ll try to get it in as soon as we can after\n\nthe crisis is over.”\n\nI affirm his position, saying, “I agree.”\n\n“You raise some good points. I approve,” she says, apparently realizing\n\nthat she wasn’t going to win this argument.\n\nI’m not sure Sarah is actually in a position to approve anything. But,\n\nluckily, the discussion turns quickly to how to regain POS functionality.\n\nI revise my opinion of Chris upward a couple of notches. I still think he\n\nwas a willing accomplice of Sarah’s, but maybe I’ll give him the benefit of\n\nthe doubt.\n\nLeaving the Phoenix war room, I see the room across the hallway where\n\nAnn and her team handle problem orders. I’m overcome by a sudden\n\ncuriosity, genuinely wanting to see how they’re doing.\n\nI knock and walk in, still chewing a stale bagel from the meeting. Since\n\nSaturday, there has been an endless supply of pizzas, pastries, Jolt colas,\n\nand coffee to keep all the troops at their tasks.\n\nBefore me is a scene of frenetic activity: There are tables covered with\n\npiles of incoming faxes from the stores and twelve people walk from one to\n\nthe next. Each fax is a problem order waiting to be routed to an army of\n\nfinance and customer service representatives who have been press-ganged\n\ninto service. Their job was to either deduplicate or reverse every one of\n\nthese transactions.\n\nIn front of me, four finance people are sitting at another table, their\n\nfingers flying across ten-key calculators and open laptops. They’re\n\nmanually tabulating the orders, trying to calculate the scale of the disaster\n\nand doing reconciliations to catch any mistakes.\n\nOn the wall, they’re keeping track of the totals. So far, five thousand\n\ncustomers have had either duplicate payments or missing orders, and there\n\nare an estimated twenty-five thousand more transactions that still need to be\n\ninvestigated.\n\nI shake my head in disbelief. Steve is right. We massively screwed the\n\ncustomers this time. It’s downright embarrassing.\n\nOn the other hand, I have to respect the operation the Finance people\n\nhave put in place to handle the mess. It looks organized, with people doing\n\nwhat needs to get done.\n\nA voice next to me says, “Another Phoenix clusterfuck, huh?”\n\nIt’s John, taking in the scene like me. He’s not saying “I told you so,”\n\nbut almost. With him, of course, is his ever-present black three-ring binder.\n\nJohn smacks his face with his palm. “If this were happening to our\n\ncompetitor, I’d be laughing my ass off. I told Chris over and over about this\n\npossibility, but he wouldn’t listen. We’re paying for it now.”\n\nHe walks up to one of the tables and starts looking over people’s\n\nshoulders. I see his body suddenly tense as he picks a pile of papers up. He\n\nflips through the papers, his face ashen.\n\nHe returns to where I’m standing, and whispers, “Bill, we’ve got a\n\nmajor problem. Outside. Now.”\n\n“Look at this order slip,” he hisses as we stand outside. “Do you see the\n\nproblem here?”\n\nI look at the page. It’s a scanned order slip, slanted and low-resolution.\n\nIt’s for a purchase of various auto parts, and the dollar amount seems\n\nreasonable at $53.\n\nI say, “Why don’t you just tell me?”\n\nJohn points to a handwritten number, scrawled by the scanned credit\n\ncard and customer signature. “That three-digit number is the CVV code on\n\nthe back of the credit card. That’s there to prevent credit card fraud, and it’s\n\nstored on track 2 of the magnetic card stripe. Under the Payment Card\n\nIndustry rules, we are not allowed to store or transmit anything on track 2.\n\nEven possessing this is an automatic cardholder data breach and an\n\nautomatic fine. Maybe even front-page news.”\n\nOh, no. Not again.\n\nHe continues, as if reading my mind, “Yeah, but worse this time. Instead\n\nof just being on the local news, imagine Steve being splashed on the front\n\npage of every market where we have customers and stores. And then flying\n\nto DC to be grilled by senators, on behalf of all their outraged constituents.”\n\nHe continues, “This is really serious. Bill, we’ve got to destroy all of\n\nthis information immediately.”\n\nI shake my head, saying, “No way. We’ve got to process every one of\n\nthose orders, so that we don’t charge or even double-charge our customers.\n\nWe’re obligated to do this, otherwise we’re taking money from them that\n\nwe’ll eventually need to return.”\n\nJohn puts his hand on my shoulder, “That may seem important, but\n\nthat’s only the tip of the iceberg. We’re already in deep shit because\n\nPhoenix leaked cardholder data. This may be just as bad. We get fined\n\naccording to the number of cardholders affected.”\n\nHe gestures at all the papers, saying, “This could more than double our\n\nfines. And you think our audits are bad now? This will make them ten times\n\nmore painful, because they’ll classify us as a Level 1 merchant for the rest\n\nof eternity. They may even raise our transaction fees from three percent\n\nto—who knows how high? That could halve our retail store profit margins\n\nand—”\n\nHe stops mid-sentence and opens up his three-ring binder to a calendar.\n\n“Oh, shit! The PCI auditors are on-site today doing a business process walk-\n\nthrough. They’re on the second floor, interviewing the order administration\n\nstaff about our operations. They’re even supposed to use this conference\n\nroom!”\n\n“You’ve got to be kidding me,” I say as the feeling of panic starts to set\n\nin, which amazes me considering that it’s been three days of constant\n\nadrenaline.\n\nI turn to look through the window of the conference door and see very\n\nclearly all the finance people handling all the customer problem orders.\n\nShit.\n\n“Look,” I say, “I know that sometimes people think you’re not on our\n\nside, but I really need your help. You’ve got to keep the auditors off this\n\nfloor. Maybe even out of this building. I’ll put up some curtains on the\n\nwindows, or maybe even barricade the door.”\n\nJohn looks at me and then nods. “Okay, I’ll handle the auditors. But I\n\nstill don’t think you fully understand. As the custodians of cardholder data,\n\nwe cannot allow hundreds of people to have access to it. The risk of theft\n\nand fraud is too high. We’ve got to destroy the data immediately.”\n\nI can’t help but laugh for a moment at the endless stream of problems.\n\nForcing myself to focus, I say slowly, “Okay, I’ll make sure the Finance\n\npeople understand this and handle it. Maybe we can get them all scanned\n\nand shipped to an offshore firm for them to enter.”\n\n“No, no, no. That’s even worse!” he says. “Remember, we’re not\n\nallowed to transmit it, let alone send it to a third party. Understand? Look,\n\njust so we can claim plausible deniability, I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear\n\nthat just now. You’ve got to figure out how to destroy all this prohibited\n\ndata!”\n\nI get pissed off at John’s mention of plausible deniability, regardless of\n\nwhether it was well intentioned or not. I take a deep breath and say to him,\n\n“Keep those auditors off this floor, and I’ll worry about the card imprints.\n\nOkay?”\n\nHe nods and says, “Roger. I’ll call you when I park the auditors\n\nsomewhere safe.”\n\nAs I watch him walk quickly down the hallway to the stairway, I keep\n\nthinking to myself, “He’s only doing his job. He’s only doing his job.”\n\nI swear under my breath and turn back around to look back at the\n\nconference room. And now I see the big printed sign hanging on the door,\n\nproclaiming “Phoenix POS Recovery War Room.”\n\nSuddenly, I feel like I’m in the movie Weekend at Bernie’s, where some\n\nteenage boys keep trying to hide or disguise a dead body from a hit man.\n\nThen I wonder if this is more like the massive around-the-clock shredding\n\noperation that allegedly happened at the offices of Arthur Andersen, the\n\naudit firm investigated after Enron failed. Am I complicit in destroying\n\nimportant evidence?\n\nWhat a mess. I shake my head, and walk back into the conference room\n\nto deliver the bad news.\n\nI finally get back down to the NOC at 2:30 p.m., and survey the carnage as I\n\nmake my way to my office. Seven extra tables have been set up to make\n\nmore meeting spaces, and there are people assembled around each of them.\n\nEmpty pizza boxes are piled up on many of the tables and in one corner of\n\nthe room.\n\nI take a seat behind my desk, sighing in relief. I spent almost an hour\n\nwith Ann’s team on the cardholder data issue, and then another half hour\n\narguing with them that this is really their problem, not mine. I told them that\n\nI could help, but that my team was too tied up trying to keep Phoenix\n\nrunning to take any more responsibility.\n\nI realize with some amazement that this may have been the first time\n\nI’ve been able to say no to anyone in the company since I started in this\n\nrole. I wonder if I could have done it if we weren’t the people almost single-\n\nhandedly keeping our store order entry systems up.\n\nAs I ponder this, my phone rings. It’s John. I answer quickly, wanting an\n\nupdate on the auditor issue. “Hey, John. How’s it going?”\n\nJohn replies, “Not terrible. I’ve got the auditors set up right next to me,\n\nhere in Building 7. I’ve rearranged it so that all the interviews will be done\n\nhere. They won’t go anywhere near the Phoenix war room, and I’ve told the\n\nBuilding 9 security people explicitly not to let them past the front desk.”\n\nI chuckle at seeing John bend all the rules. “That’s great. Thanks for\n\npulling all that together. Also, I think Ann could use your help figuring what\n\nexactly it takes to stay in compliance with the cardholder data regulations. I\n\nhelped as best I could, but…”\n\nJohn says, “No problem. I’m happy to assist.”\n\nHe hesitates for a couple of moments. “I hate to bring it up now, but you\n\nwere supposed to give internal audit the SOX-404 response letter today. How\n\nis that coming along?”\n\nI burst out in laughter. “John, our plan was to get that report done over\n\nthe weekend after the Phoenix deployment. But, as you know, things didn’t\n\nquite go as planned. I doubt anyone has worked on it since Friday.”\n\nIn a very concerned voice, John says, “You know that the entire audit\n\ncommittee looks at this, right? If we blow this deadline, it’s like a red flag\n\nto everyone that we have severe control issues. This could drive up the\n\nlength of the external audit, too.”\n\nI say as reasonably as I can, “Trust me, if there was anything I could do,\n\nI would. But right now, my entire team has been working around-the-clock\n\nto support the Phoenix recovery efforts. Even if they completed the report,\n\nand all I had to do was bend over and pick it up, I couldn’t. We’re that far\n\nunderwater.”\n\nAs I’m talking, I realize how liberating it is to state that my team is\n\nabsolutely at capacity and that there aren’t any calories left over for any\n\nnew tasks, and people actually believe me.\n\nI hear John say, “You know, I could free two engineers up. Maybe they\n\ncould help do some of the legwork around estimating the remediation\n\neffort? Or if you need it, we could even put them into the technical resource\n\npool to help with recovery. They’re both very technical and experienced.”\n\nMy ears perk up. We’ve got everyone deployed doing all sorts of things\n\nthat this emergency requires and most have pulled at least one all-nighter.\n\nSome are monitoring fragile services and systems, others are helping field\n\nphone calls from the store managers, others are helping QA build systems\n\nand write tests, some are helping Development reproduce problems.\n\nI say immediately, “That would be incredibly helpful. Send Wes an e-\n\nmail with a couple of bullet points on each of your engineers. If he doesn’t\n\nhave an urgent need for their skills, I’ll task them on generating the\n\nremediation estimates, as long as it doesn’t require interrupting anyone\n\nworking Phoenix.”\n\n“Okay, great,” John says. “I’ll send the info to Wes later today, and I’ll\n\nlet you know what he and I decide to do.”\n\nHe signs off, and I consider the potential stroke of good fortune that\n\nsomeone could be working on the audit response.\n\nI then wonder if the fatigue is getting to me. Something is really screwy\n\nin the world when I’m finding reasons to thank Development and Security\n\nin the same day.\n\nChapter 14 • Tuesday, September 16\n\nBy late Monday night, we had stabilized the situation. Working with Chris’\n\nteam, the stores finally had working cash registers again, but everyone\n\nknows it’s only a temporary fix. At least we don’t need to keep sensitive\n\ncardholder data anymore, much to John’s relief.\n\nIt’s 10:37 a.m., and I’m standing outside of Steve’s office with Chris.\n\nHe’s leaning against the wall, looking pensively at the floor. Ann, John, and\n\nKirsten are also here, waiting for their turn, like penitent students waiting\n\noutside the principal’s office in elementary school.\n\nThe door to Steve’s office opens and Sarah walks out. She looks ashen\n\nfaced and on the verge of tears. She was the first to go in, and her session\n\ndidn’t even take the whole ten minutes.\n\nShe closes the door behind her, blows out her breath, and says to Chris\n\nand me, “You’re next.”\n\n“Here goes nothing…,” I say, opening the door.\n\nSteve stands by the window, looking out over the corporate campus.\n\n“Take a seat, gentlemen.”\n\nWhen we’re sitting down, Steve starts to pace in front of us. “I’ve talked\n\nwith Sarah. As the project leader, I’m holding her responsible for the\n\nsuccess or failure of Phoenix. I have no idea if I have a leadership problem\n\nor if she just has the wrong people on the bus.”\n\nMy jaw drops. Did Sarah somehow manage to weasel her way out of her\n\npart in this disaster? This whole thing is her fault!",

      "content": "Steve turns to Chris. “We put over $20 million into this project, and the\n\nlion’s share went to your team. From where I’m standing, we’d be better off\n\nif we had nothing to show for it. Instead, I have half my company\n\nscrambling to pick up the wreckage from the damage you caused.”\n\nTurning back to both of us, he continues, “In the good years, we were a\n\nfive percent net margin company. That meant to make $1 million, we had to\n\nsell $20 million in products. Who knows how many sales we lost over the\n\nweekend and how many loyal customers we’ve lost forever.”\n\nHe starts pacing again. “We’ve done a terrible disservice to our\n\ncustomers. They’re the people who need to fix their cars to get to work.\n\nThey’re fathers working on projects with their kids. We’ve also screwed\n\nsome of our best suppliers and clients.\n\n“To appease the people who actually used Phoenix, Marketing is now\n\ngiving away $100 vouchers, which could cost us millions of dollars.\n\nGoddamnit, we’re supposed to take money from customers, not the other\n\nway around!”\n\nAs a former sergeant, I know there’s a time and place for dressing\n\nsomeone down. But this is too much. “No offense, sir, but this is supposed\n\nto be news to me? I called you, explaining what would happen, asking you\n\nto delay the launch. You not only blew me off, you told me to try to\n\nconvince Sarah. Where’s your responsibility in all of this? Or have you\n\noutsourced all your thinking to her?”\n\nAs I’m talking, I realize I may be making a big mistake by saying what I\n\nreally think. Maybe it’s from weeks of crisis-fueled adrenaline, but it feels\n\ngood rattling Steve’s cage. Really good.\n\nSteve stops pacing, pointing his finger at my forehead. “I know more\n\nabout responsibility than you may learn in your entire lifetime. I’m tired of\n\nyour Chicken Little routine, screaming that the sky is falling and then\n\nhappily saying ‘I told you so’ afterward. I need you to come to me with\n\nsome actual solutions.”\n\nLeaning into him, I say, “I told you exactly what was going to happen\n\nwhen your sidekick Sarah brought up this crazy plan almost two weeks ago.\n\nI proposed to you a timeline that would have prevented all this from\n\nhappening. You tell me that I could have done better? I’m all ears.” With\n\nexaggerated respect, I add, “Sir.”\n\n“I’ll tell you what I need from you,” he replies calmly. “I need the\n\nbusiness to tell me it’s no longer being held hostage by you IT guys. This\n\nhas been the running complaint the entire time I’ve been CEO. IT is in the\n\nway of every major initiative. Meanwhile, our competitors pull away from\n\nus, leaving us in the dust. Dammit, we can’t even take a crap without IT\n\nbeing in the way.”\n\nHe takes a deep breath. “None of this is why you’re here today. I called\n\nyou in to tell you two things. First, thanks to this latest IT screwup, the\n\nboard has insisted that we investigate splitting up the company. They think\n\nthe company is worth more sold off in pieces. I’m against this, but they’ve\n\nalready got consultants in our panties investigating its feasibility. There’s\n\nnothing I can do about that.\n\n“Second, I’m done playing Russian roulette with IT. Phoenix just shows\n\nme that IT is a competency that we may not be able to develop here. Maybe\n\nit’s not in our DNA. I’ve given Dick the green light to investigate\n\noutsourcing all of IT and asked him to select a vendor in ninety days.”\n\nOutsourcing all of IT. Holy shit.\n\nThat means everyone in my entire department may not have jobs\n\nanymore.\n\nThat means that I may not have a job anymore.\n\nIn a sudden and sobering instant, I realize that the feeling of elation and\n\nconfidence I felt rattling Steve’s cage was only an illusion. He has all the\n\npower. With a wave of his pen, he could outsource all of us to the lowest-\n\ncost bidder from some random corner of the planet.\n\nI glance over at Chris, and he looks as shaken as I feel.\n\nSteve continues, “I expect you’ll give Dick all the help he requires. If\n\nyou can pull off some sort of miracle during the next ninety days, we’ll\n\nconsider keeping IT in-house.”\n\n“Thank you, gentlemen. Please send in Kirsten,” he says with finality.\n\n“Sorry I’m late,” I say, slumping down in the booth across from Chris.\n\nShell-shocked after our meeting with Steve, he and I decided to meet for\n\nlunch. In front of him is some sort of fruity drink with an umbrella. I always\n\nfigured him to be a blue-collar drinker—more like Pabst Blue Ribbon, not\n\nsome bachelorette party mixed drink.\n\nHe laughs humorlessly. “Trust me. You showing up ten minutes late is\n\nthe least of my problems. Get yourself a drink.”\n\nPaige tells me repeatedly that I shouldn’t trust this guy. She has a great\n\ninstinct for people, but when it comes to me, she’s embarrassingly\n\nprotective, which makes me laugh. I’m the ex-Marine, after all. She’s just a\n\n“nice nurse.”\n\n“Any pilsner you have on tap, please,” I say to the waitress. “And a\n\nscotch and water, too. It’s been a rough day.”\n\n“That’s what I heard. No problem at all, sweetie,” she replies, laughing.\n\nTo Chris, she asks, “Another mai tai for you?”\n\nHe nods, handing her his empty glass. So that’s what a mai tai looks\n\nlike. I’ve never tried one. We Marines are very self-conscious about what\n\nwe’re seen drinking.\n\nChris raises his water glass and says, “To having a common death\n\nsentence.”\n\nI smile wanly and raise my glass. Feeling obligated to inject some\n\noptimism, I say, “And here’s to figuring out how we get a stay of execution\n\nfrom the governor.”\n\nWe clink glasses.\n\n“You know, I’ve been thinking,” Chris says. “Maybe my group being\n\noutsourced wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. I’ve been in software\n\ndevelopment for virtually my entire career. I’m used to everyone\n\ndemanding miracles, expecting the impossible, people changing\n\nrequirements at the last minute, but, after living through this latest\n\nnightmare project, I wonder if it might be time for a change…”\n\nI can’t believe it. Chris has always been confident, even arrogant,\n\nseeming to really love doing what he does. “What kind of change? You\n\nthinking about opening a mai tai bar in Florida or something like that?”\n\nChris shrugs. When he looks down, I can see the huge bags underneath\n\nhis eyes and the fatigue in his face. “I used to love this work, but it’s gotten\n\nso much more difficult over the last ten years. Technology keeps changing\n\nfaster and faster, and it’s nearly impossible to keep up anymore.”\n\nThe waitress comes back with our drinks. Part of me feels guilty about\n\ndrinking during lunch on company time, but I figure I’ve earned it, having\n\ngiven enough of my personal time to the company over the last two weeks.\n\nChris takes a long swig, and so do I.\n\nHe continues, “It’s crazy what programmers, and even managers like\n\nme, have to learn every couple of years. Sometimes it’s a totally new\n\ndatabase technology, a new programming or project management method,\n\nor a new technology delivery model, like cloud computing.\n\n“Just how many times can you throw out everything you know to keep\n\nup with the latest new-fangled trend? I look in the mirror every once in\n\nawhile, asking myself, ‘Will this be the year that I give up? Will I spend the\n\nrest of my career doing COBOL maintenance or become just another has-\n\nbeen middle manager?’”\n\nI laugh sympathetically. I chose to be in the technology backwaters. I\n\nwas happy there. That is, until Steve threw me back into the big, shark-\n\ninfested pool.\n\nShaking his head, he continues, “It’s harder than ever to convince the\n\nbusiness to do the right thing. They’re like kids in a candy store. They read\n\nin an airline magazine that they can manage their whole supply chain in the\n\ncloud for $499 per year, and suddenly that’s the main company initiative.\n\nWhen we tell them it’s not actually that easy, and show them what it takes\n\nto do it right, they disappear. Where did they go? They’re talking to their\n\nCousin Vinnie or some outsourcing sales guy who promises they can do it\n\nin a tenth of the time and cost.”\n\nI laugh. “A couple of years ago, someone in Marketing asked my group\n\nto support a database reporting tool that one of their summer interns wrote.\n\nIt was actually pretty brilliant, given that she only had a couple of months to\n\nwork on it, and then it started being used in daily operations. How in the\n\nhell do you support and secure something that’s written in Microsoft\n\nAccess? When the auditors found out that we couldn’t secure access to all\n\nthe data, we spent weeks cobbling together something that satisfied them.\n\n“It’s like the free puppy,” I continue. “It’s not the upfront capital that\n\nkills you, it’s the operations and maintenance on the back end.”\n\nChris cracks up. “Yes, exactly! They’ll say, ‘The puppy can’t quite do\n\neverything we need. Can you train it to fly airplanes? It’s just a simple\n\nmatter of coding, right?’”\n\nAfter we order food, I tell him about how reluctant I was to accept my\n\nnew role and my inability to get my arms around all the work that my group\n\nhas committed to.\n\n“Interesting,” Chris says. “You know, we’re struggling, too. We’ve\n\nnever had so many problems hitting our ship dates. My engineers keep\n\ngetting pulled off of feature development to handle escalations when things\n\nbreak. And deployments keep taking longer and longer. What used to take\n\nten minutes to deploy starts taking an hour. Then a full day, then an entire\n\nweekend, then four days. I’ve even got some deployments that are now\n\ntaking over a week to complete. Like Phoenix.”\n\nHe continues, “What use is it having all these offshore developers\n\nbuilding features if we aren’t getting to market any faster? We keep\n\nlengthening the deployment intervals, so that we can get more features\n\ndeployed in each batch.”\n\nHe laughs. “I was in a meeting last week where the feature backlog was\n\nso long, the product managers were arguing about which features will get\n\nworked on three years from now! We can’t even plan effectively for one\n\nyear, let alone three years! What’s the use?”\n\nI listen intently. What’s happening with Phoenix is a combination of the\n\nneed to deliver needed features to market, forcing us to take shortcuts,\n\nwhich are causing ever-worsening deployments. He’s put his finger on a\n\nvery important downward spiral we need to break out of.\n\n“Listen, Bill, I know it’s a little late to say this, but better late than never.\n\nI’m really sorry about my part in this Phoenix fiasco. Sarah came to me a\n\nweek before Kirsten’s project management meeting, asking me all sorts of\n\nquestions. She asked when would be the soonest that we could be code-\n\ncomplete. I had no idea she was going to interpret that as the go-live date,\n\nespecially with Steve in the room. William predicted that it was going to be\n\na disaster, and I should have listened to him, too. That was bad judgment on\n\nmy part.”\n\nI look into his eyes for a couple of moments. I finally decide to believe\n\nhim. I nod and say, “Thanks. Don’t worry about it.”\n\nI add, “But don’t do it again. If you do, I’ll break both of your legs, and\n\nthen I’ll have Wes attend every one of your staff meetings. I’m not sure\n\nwhich is more motivating.”\n\nChris smiles, raising his glass. “Here’s to never letting this happen\n\nagain, eh?”\n\nA good thought. I smile and clink my glass against his.\n\nI finish my second beer. “I’m really worried that Sarah is going to try to\n\nblame this whole thing on us, you know?”\n\nChris looks up from his glass and says, “She’s like Teflon. Nothing\n\nsticks to her. We’ve got to stick together. I’ve got your back, and I’ll give\n\nyou a heads-up if I see her trying some weird political crap again.”\n\n“Likewise,” I say emphatically.\n\nI look at my watch. It’s 1:20 p.m. It’s time to head back, so I signal our\n\nwaitress for the check. “This has been great. We need to do this more often.\n\nHow about we meet once a week and figure out what we need to do to head\n\noff this boneheaded idea to outsource all of IT?”\n\n“Absolutely,” he says. “I don’t know about you, but I’m not going to roll\n\nover on this. I’m going down swinging.”\n\nWith that, we shake hands.\n\nEven after eating some food, I feel buzzed. I wonder where I can find some\n\nbreath mints so I won’t smell like I spent the morning in a distillery.\n\nI look at my schedule on my phone, and move all my meetings to later\n\nin the week. At 4 p.m., I’m still in my office when I get an e-mail from\n\nChris.\n\nFrom: Chris Allers\n\nTo: Bill Palmer\n\nDate: September 16, 4:07 PM\n\nSubject: Throwing a little post-Phoenix party\n\nHey, Bill…\n\nIt was good meeting for lunch—I had a great time.\n\nWe’re throwing a little impromptu party to celebrate the\n\ncompletion of Phoenix. It’s nothing elaborate, but I’ve ordered a beer\n\nkeg, some wine and food, and we’re congregating right now in the\n\nBldg 7 lunchroom.\n\nWe’d love to have your folks join us. In my mind, it was one of\n\nthe best team efforts I’ve seen in this company. I ordered enough\n\nbooze for everyone on your team, too. :-)\n\nSee you there,\n\nChris\n\nI genuinely appreciate Chris’ gesture, and I think my team will, too.\n\nEspecially Wes. I forward the e-mail to Wes and Patty, telling them to\n\nencourage everyone to make an appearance. They deserve it.\n\nA couple of moments later my phone vibrates. I look down and read a\n\nreply from Wes:\n\nFrom: Wes Davis\n\nTo: Bill Palmer, Patty McKee\n\nDate: September 16, 4:09 PM\n\nSubject: Re: Fwd: Throwing a little post-Phoenix party\n\nWhat a jackass. Most of my guys won’t be able to make it. We’re\n\nstill busy fixing all the bad transaction data that their shitty code\n\ngenerated.\n\nMust be nice to have the luxury of celebrating. “Mission\n\nAccomplished” and all that, right?\n\nW\n\nI groan. Although the crisis might be over for Chris’ guys on the upper\n\nfloors, the people like us in the basement are still bailing water.\n\nStill, I think it’s important that we get our guys to drop by the party. In\n\norder to succeed, we need to create these relationships with Chris’ team.\n\nEven if it’s only for a half hour.\n\nI grit my teeth and call Wes. As Spock once said, “Only Nixon could go\n\nto China.” And I guess I’m Nixon.\n\nChapter 15 • Wednesday, September 17\n\nEven though I can’t take the entire day off, I take Paige out for breakfast.\n\nShe’s been holding things down on the home front single-handedly while I\n\nhave spent every waking hour at work.\n\nWe’re at Mother’s, one of our favorite breakfast restaurants. We were\n\nhere on their opening day almost eight years ago. The owner has since hit\n\nthe big time. Not only has her restaurant become a local favorite, but she’s\n\nwritten a cookbook, and we saw her all over TV during her book tour.\n\nWe are so happy to see her success. And I know Paige loves it when the\n\nowner recognizes us, even when it’s crowded.\n\nI look in Paige’s eyes as she sits across from me at the table. The\n\nrestaurant is surprisingly crowded on a Wednesday morning. People having\n\nbusiness meetings and local hipsters doing—well, whatever local hipsters\n\ndo in the mornings. Working? Playing? I genuinely have no idea.\n\nShe says, holding the mimosa in her hands, “Thanks for taking some\n\ntime off—are you sure you can’t spend the rest of the day with me?”\n\nAt first, I almost didn’t order one for myself, because I didn’t want to\n\nhave anything alcoholic on a workday. But, for the second day in a row, I\n\nfind myself saying, “Screw it.”\n\nDrinking my orange juice and champagne, I smile sadly, shaking my\n\nhead. “I really wish I could, honey. If we were in Development, I’d give the\n\nentire team the day off like Chris did. But, in Operations, we’re still\n\nfinishing cleaning up from the Phoenix fiasco. I have no idea when life will\n\nbe normal again.”",

      "content": "She shakes her head slowly. “I can’t believe that this is only your third\n\nweek. You’ve changed. I’m not complaining, but I haven’t seen you this\n\nstressed out since…”\n\nShe looks up for a moment, reviewing her memories. She looks back at\n\nme and says, “Ever! Half the time we’re driving in the car, you have this\n\ndistant look on your face. The rest of the time you’re clenching your jaw,\n\nlike you’re reenacting some terrible meeting in your head. You never hear\n\nwhat I’m saying, because you’re so preoccupied by work.”\n\nI start to apologize, but she cuts me off. “I’m not complaining. I don’t\n\nwant to wreck this nice moment while we’re enjoying some time away from\n\nwork and the kids. But, when I think about how happy you were before you\n\naccepted this role, I wonder why you’re doing it.”\n\nI purse my lips together. Even with all the trauma in the past couple of\n\nweeks, I feel like the organization has been better off as a result of my\n\ncontribution. And even with the imminent threat of being outsourced, I’m\n\nglad that I’m one of the people trying to fend them off.\n\nAnd yet, for over five years, I was one of the very few people able to\n\nmaintain any amount of work-life balance. And now that balance is\n\ncompletely gone.\n\nA fellow NCO in the Marines once told me that his priorities were the\n\nfollowing: provider, parent, spouse, and change agent. In that order.\n\nI think about that. First and foremost, my most important responsibility\n\nis to be the provider for my family. My pay raise will help us get our debt\n\npaid down, and we can start saving money again for our children’s college\n\neducation like we always wanted to. It’d be difficult to give that up and go\n\nback to feeling like we’re just treading water.\n\nWe both suspect that our house is now worth less than we paid for it. We\n\ntried to sell it a couple of years ago so we could move across town to be\n\ncloser to her parents. But after nine months, we took it off the market.\n\nWith my promotion, we can pay off our second mortgage sooner. And\n\nmaybe, just maybe, if things go well, in a few years Paige might be able to\n\nstop working.\n\nBut is it worth having to deal with Steve’s raving demands for the\n\nimpossible, day in and day out?\n\nEven worse: having to deal with that nutcase, Sarah.\n\n“See? You’re doing it again. Let me guess,” Paige says, interrupting my\n\nthoughts. “You’re thinking about some meeting that you’ve had with Steve,\n\nand how he’s turned into a total asshole that no one can reason with. Except\n\nfor that nutcase, Sarah.”\n\nI laugh. “How did you know?”\n\nShe smiles. “It’s so easy. You start looking off somewhere, and then\n\nyour shoulders and jaw tense up, and your lips press together.”\n\nI laugh again.\n\nPaige’s expression turns sad. “I keep wishing that they picked someone\n\nelse for this job. Steve knew exactly how to get you to say yes. He just\n\nmade it sound like it was your duty to save his job and the company.”\n\nI nod slowly. “But, honey, now it’s really true—if they outsource all of\n\nIT, almost two hundred people in my group could be out of a job or working\n\nfor some faceless outsourcing firm. And another two hundred people in\n\nChris’ organization. I really feel like I can keep that from happening.”\n\nShe looks dubious, saying, “You really think you and Chris can stop\n\nthem? Based on what you’ve said, it sure sounds like they’ve already made\n\nup their mind.”\n\nAfter I drop off a subdued Paige at home, I take a moment in the driveway\n\nto look at my phone before driving into work.\n\nI’m surprised when I see an upbeat e-mail from Wes.\n\nFrom: Wes Davis\n\nTo: Bill Palmer, Patty McKee\n\nDate: September 19, 9:45 AM\n\nSubject: FW: Whew! A change management close call!\n\nCheck this out, guys. One of the DBAs sent this out to all the other\n\nengineers this morning.\n\n>>> Begin forwarded message:\n\nGuys, the new change process saved our bacon this morning.\n\nToday, we had two groups simultaneously making changes to the\n\nmaterials management database and application servers. Neither\n\ngroup knew about the other.\n\nRajiv spotted the potential collision on the change wall. We\n\ndecided that my changes would go in first, and I’d call him when we\n\nwere done.\n\nWe could have totally made a mess of things.\n\nKeep those change cards coming, guys! It saved our butts today!\n\nThanks to Rajiv, Tom, Shelly, and Brent —\n\nRobert\n\nAt last, some good news. One of the problems of prevention is that you\n\nrarely know about the disasters you averted.\n\nBut here we did. Nice.\n\nAnd even better yet, it came from one of the engineers, not a manager.\n\nWhen I get to my desk, I see the Post-it note on my docking station and\n\nsmile. I carefully power on my laptop, wait patiently for two minutes for the\n\nlogin screen to come up before plugging it into the docking station.\n\nNo screaming alarm. Exactly as documented. Nice.\n\nSomeone knocks on my door.\n\nIt’s Patty. “I’m glad I caught you. Do you have a minute? I think we\n\nhave another problem.”\n\n“Sure,” I say. “What’s on your mind? Let me guess—more people\n\ncomplaining about change management?”\n\nPatty shakes her head, looking grim. “A little more serious than that.\n\nLet’s go to the Change Coordination Room?”\n\nI groan. Every time Patty’s summons me there, it’s because of some new\n\nintractable problem. But problems, like dog poop left in the rain, rarely get\n\nbetter just by ignoring them.\n\nI stand up and say, “Lead on.”\n\nWhen we get to the conference room, I look at the change board.\n\nSomething looks very different. “Uh-oh,” I say.\n\nPatty looks at the board with me and says, “Uh-huh. Obvious, and yet,\n\nstill kind of unexpected, right?”\n\nI can only grunt in response.\n\nOn the board, up until last Thursday, it’s pretty much as I remember it.\n\nOn each day, there are somewhere between forty and fifty changes, each\n\nmarked completed. But on the days following, there are barely any changes\n\nposted at all. It’s like someone just wiped all the cards clean off the board.\n\n“Where did they go?”\n\nShe points at another board on the side of the room that she’s labeled,\n\n“Changes To Be Rescheduled.” There’s a basket underneath, overflowing\n\nwith piles and piles of index cards.\n\nPresumably, six hundred of them.\n\nUnderstanding starting to dawn on me, I ask, “And the reason none of\n\nthe changes got completed is…”\n\nPatty rolls her eyes. “Phoenix happened, that’s what. All scheduled work\n\nwent out the window. We mobilized almost anyone who could type to help.\n\nAnd only now are they being released back to their normal duties. You can\n\nsee on the board that today’s the first day that scheduled changes are\n\nstarting to happen as planned again.”\n\nThis seems important for some reason.\n\nAnd then it hits me.\n\nI had called Erik briefly to tell him that I had discovered three of the\n\nfour categories of work: business projects, internal projects, and changes.\n\nHe merely said that there was one more type of work, maybe the most\n\nimportant type, because it’s so destructive.\n\nAnd in a searing moment of insight, I think I know what the fourth\n\ncategory of work is.\n\nAnd then suddenly, I don’t. My tenuous understanding flickers briefly,\n\nand then goes out entirely.\n\nI say, “Damn!”\n\nPatty looks at me questioningly, but I ignore her while I try to recapture\n\nthat fleeting moment of clarity.\n\nI look at the portion of the change board with no cards on it. It really is\n\nlike some giant hand swept all those change cards aside that we had so\n\nmeticulously scheduled and arranged on the board. And we know what\n\nswept it aside: It was Phoenix blowing up.\n\nBut Phoenix isn’t the fourth category of work.\n\nMaybe what I’m looking for is like dark matter. You can only see it by\n\nwhat it displaces or how it interacts with other matter that we can see.\n\nPatty called it firefighting. That’s work, too, I suppose. It certainly kept\n\neveryone up at all hours of the night. And it displaced all the planned\n\nchanges.\n\nI turn back to Patty and say slowly, “Let me guess. Brent didn’t get any\n\nof his non-Phoenix change work completed either, right?”\n\n“Of course not! You were there, right?” she says, looking at me like I\n\nhad grown eight heads. “Brent was working around-the-clock on the\n\nrecovery efforts, building all the new tooling to keep all the systems and\n\ndata up. Everything else was put on the back-burner.”\n\nAll the firefighting displaced all the planned work, both projects and\n\nchanges.\n\nAh… Now I see it.\n\nWhat can displace planned work?\n\nUnplanned work.\n\nOf course.\n\nI laugh uproariously, which earns me a look of genuine concern from\n\nPatty, who even takes a step back from me.\n\nThat’s why Erik called it the most destructive type of work. It’s not\n\nreally work at all, like the others. The others are what you planned on\n\ndoing, allegedly because you needed to do it.\n\nUnplanned work is what prevents you from doing it. Like matter and\n\nantimatter, in the presence of unplanned work, all planned work ignites with\n\nincandescent fury, incinerating everything around it. Like Phoenix.\n\nSo much of what I’ve been trying to do during my short tenure as VP of\n\nIT Operations is to prevent unplanned work from happening: coordinating\n\nchanges better so they don’t fail, ensuring the orderly handling of incidents\n\nand outages to prevent interrupting key resources, doing whatever it takes\n\nso that Brent won’t be escalated to…\n\nI’ve been doing it mostly by instinct. I knew it was what had to be done,\n\nbecause people were working on the wrong things. I tried to take all\n\nnecessary steps to keep people from doing wrong work, or rather,\n\nunplanned work.\n\nI say, cackling and pumping my arms as if I had just scored a game-\n\nwinning, sixty-yard field goal, “Yes! I see it now! It really is unplanned\n\nwork! The fourth category of work is unplanned work!”\n\nMy ebullient mood is tempered when I look at Patty, who looks puzzled\n\nand genuinely concerned.\n\n“I promise to explain later,” I say. “Just what is it that you wanted me to\n\nsee on the change board?”\n\nShe’s taken aback, but points again at the void of completed changes for\n\nthe past week. “I know you were concerned about when sixty percent of the\n\nchanges weren’t getting completed. So, I thought you’d really flip your lid\n\nwhen one hundred percent of the changes didn’t complete. Right?”\n\n“Yep. This is great work, Patty. Keep it up!” I say agreeably.\n\nAnd then I turn around and head out the door, reaching for my cell\n\nphone. There’s someone I need to call.\n\n“Hey!” Patty calls out. “Aren’t you going to fill me in?”\n\nI yell over my shoulder, “Later! I promise!”\n\nBack at my desk I search everywhere for that slip of paper that Erik gave\n\nme. I’m pretty sure I didn’t throw it away, but I honestly didn’t think that I\n\nwould ever use it.\n\nI hear Ellen say from behind me, “Need help with anything?”\n\nAnd soon, both of us are scrounging all over my desk to find that little\n\npiece of paper.\n\n“Is this it?” she asks, holding up something that she retrieved from my\n\ninbox.\n\nI look more closely, and yes! It’s the crumpled two-inch strip of paper\n\nthat Erik gave me. It looks a gum wrapper.\n\nTaking the piece of paper from her and holding it up, I say, “Great!\n\nThank you so much for finding this—believe it or not, this may be the most\n\nimportant piece of paper I’ve gotten in years.”\n\nI decide to sit outside while I talk. In the bright autumn sunlight, I find a\n\nspot on a bench near the parking lot. As I sit down, there’s not a cloud in the\n\nsky.\n\nI call Erik, who answers on the first ring. “Hey, Bill. How are you guys\n\ndoing after Phoenix crashed and burned so spectacularly?”\n\n“Yeah, well… Things are improving,” I say. “You may have heard that\n\nour POS systems went down, and we also had a small credit card number\n\nbreach.”\n\n“Ha! ‘Small credit card breach.’ I like that. Like ‘small nuclear reactor\n\nmeltdown.’ I’ve gotta write that one down,” he says, snorting.\n\nHe’s chuckling as though he predicted this level of calamity would\n\noccur, which, come to think of it, I suppose he did, in the conference room\n\nwhen I first met him. Something about “clearing the calendar.”\n\nJust like clearing the change board, I realize. I kick myself for not\n\npicking up on his clue sooner.\n\n“I trust you can tell me now what the four categories of work are?” I\n\nhear him ask.\n\n“Yes, I think I can,” I say. “At the plant, I gave you one category, which\n\nwas business projects, like Phoenix,” I say. “Later, I realized that I didn’t\n\nmention internal IT projects. A week after that, I realized that changes are\n\nanother category of work. But it was only after the Phoenix fiasco that I saw\n\nthe last one, because of how it prevented all other work from getting\n\ncompleted, and that’s the last category, isn’t it? Firefighting. Unplanned\n\nwork.”\n\n“Precisely!” I hear Erik say. “You even used the term I like most for it:\n\nunplanned work. Firefighting is vividly descriptive, but ‘unplanned work’ is\n\neven better. It might even be better to call it ‘anti-work,’ since it further\n\nhighlights its destructive and avoidable nature.\n\n“Unlike the other categories of work, unplanned work is recovery work,\n\nwhich almost always takes you away from your goals. That’s why it’s so\n\nimportant to know where your unplanned work is coming from.”\n\nI smile as he acknowledges my correct answer, and am oddly pleased\n\nthat he validated my antimatter notion of unplanned work, as well.\n\nHe says, “What is this change board that you mentioned?”\n\nI tell him about my attempts to get some sort of change process going\n\nand my attempt to elevate the discussion above how many fields there were\n\non the change form, which then resulted in getting people to put their\n\nintended changes on index cards and our need to juggle them on the board.\n\n“Very good,” he says. “You’ve put together tools to help with the visual\n\nmanagement of work and pulling work through the system. This is a critical\n\npart of the First Way, which is creating fast flow of work through\n\nDevelopment and IT Operations. Index cards on a kanban board is one of\n\nthe best mechanisms to do this, because everyone can see WIP. Now you\n\nmust continually eradicate your largest sources of unplanned work, per the\n\nSecond Way.”\n\nUntil now, having been so wrapped up in defining what work is, I had\n\nforgotten about Erik and his Three Ways. I dismissed them before, but I’m\n\nnow listening closely to his every word.\n\nAnd over the next forty-five minutes, I find myself telling him the entire\n\ntale of my short tenure. I’m interrupted only by Erik’s loud laughs and\n\nguffaws as I describe the calamities and my attempts to curb the chaos.\n\nWhen I’m finished, he says, “You’ve come much further than I thought:\n\nYou’ve started to take steps to stabilize the operational environment, you’ve\n\nstarted to visually manage WIP within IT Operations, and you’ve started to\n\nprotect your constraint, Brent. You’ve also reinforced a culture of\n\noperational rigor and discipline. Well done, Bill.”\n\nI furrow my brows and say, “Wait. Brent is my constraint? What do you\n\nmean?”\n\nHe replies, “Ah, well if we’re going to talk about your next steps, you\n\ndefinitely need to know about constraints because you need to increase\n\nflow. Right now, nothing is more important.”\n\nErik assumes a lecturing voice as he starts, “You say you learned about\n\nplant operations management when you were in business school. I hope as\n\npart of your curriculum, you read The Goal by Dr. Eli Goldratt. If you don’t\n\nhave a copy anymore, get another one. You’re going to need it.”\n\nI think my copy of that book is in my office at home. As I jot a quick\n\nreminder to look for it, he continues, “Goldratt taught us that in most plants,\n\nthere are a very small number of resources, whether it’s men, machines, or\n\nmaterials, that dictates the output of the entire system. We call this the\n\nconstraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until\n\nyou create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint,\n\nthe constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely\n\nbeing drastically underutilized.\n\n“That means you’re not delivering to the business the full capacity\n\navailable to you. It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical\n\ndebt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to\n\nincrease over time,” he says.\n\nHe continues, “You’ve identified this Brent person as a constraint to\n\nrestore service. Trust me, you’ll find that he constrains many other\n\nimportant flows of work, as well.”\n\nI try to interrupt to ask a question, but he continues headlong, “There are\n\nfive focusing steps which Goldratt describes in The Goal: Step 1 is to\n\nidentify the constraint. You’ve done that, so congratulations. Keep\n\nchallenging yourself to really make sure that’s your organizational\n\nconstraint, because if you’re wrong, nothing you do will matter. Remember,\n\nany improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes?\n\n“Step 2 is to exploit the constraint,” he continues. “In other words, make\n\nsure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. It should\n\nnever be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always\n\nbe working on the highest priority commitment the IT Operations\n\norganization has made to the rest of the enterprise. Always.”\n\nI hear him say encouragingly, “You’ve done a good job exploiting the\n\nconstraint on several fronts. You’ve reduced reliance on Brent for\n\nunplanned work and outages. You’ve even started to figure out how to\n\nexploit Brent better for the three other types of work: business and IT\n\nprojects and changes. Remember, unplanned work kills your ability to do\n\nplanned work, so you must always do whatever it takes to eradicate it.\n\nMurphy does exist, so you’ll always have unplanned work, but it must be\n\nhandled efficiently. You’ve still got a long way to go.”\n\nIn a more stern voice, he says, “But you’re ready to start thinking about\n\nStep 3, which is to subordinate the constraint. In the Theory of Constraints,\n\nthis is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope. In\n\nThe Goal, the main character, Alex, learns about this when he discovers that\n\nHerbie, the slowest Boy Scout in the troop, actually dictates the entire\n\ngroup’s marching pace. Alex moved Herbie to the front of the line, to\n\nprevent kids from going on too far ahead. Later at Alex’s plant, he started to\n\nrelease all work in accordance to the rate it could be consumed by the heat\n\ntreat ovens, which was his plant’s bottleneck. That was his real-life Herbie.\n\n“Fully two decades after The Goal was published,” he continues, “David\n\nJ. Anderson developed techniques of using a kanban board to release work\n\nand control WIP for Development and IT Operations. You may find that of\n\ninterest. You and Penelope are close with your change board to a kanban\n\nboard that can manage flow.\n\n“So, here’s your homework,” he says. “Figure out how to set the tempo\n\nof work according to Brent. Once you make the appropriate mapping of IT\n\nOperations to work on the plant floor, it will be obvious. Call me when\n\nyou’ve figured it out.”\n\n“Wait, wait,” I say, hurriedly before he hangs up. “I’ll do the homework,\n\nbut aren’t we missing the entire point here? What caused all the unplanned\n\nwork is Phoenix. Why are we focusing on Brent right now? Don’t we need\n\nto address all the issues with Phoenix inside of Development, where all the\n\nunplanned work actually came from?”\n\n“Now you sound just like Jimmy, complaining about things you can’t\n\ncontrol,” he sighs. “Of course Phoenix is causing all the problems. You get\n\nwhat you design for. Chester, your peer in Development, is spending all his\n\ncycles on features, instead of stability, security, scalability, manageability,\n\noperability, continuity, and all those other beautiful ’itties.\n\n“On the other end of the assembly line, Jimmy keeps trying to retrofit\n\nproduction controls after the toothpaste is out of the tube,” he says,\n\nscoffing. “Hopeless! Futile! It’ll never work! You need to design these\n\nthings, what some call ‘nonfunctional requirements,’ into the product. But\n\nyour problem is that the person who knows the most about where your\n\ntechnical debt is and how to actually build code that is designed for\n\nOperations is too busy. You know who that person is, don’t you?”\n\nI groan. “Brent.”\n\n“Yep,” he says. “Without solving your Brent problem, you’ll just be\n\ninviting him to design and architecture meetings with Development, but\n\nhe’ll never show up because…”\n\nBeing prompted again, I respond, “Unplanned work.”\n\n“Good!” he says. “You’re getting better at this. But before you get a big\n\nhead, I’ll tell you that there’s still a big piece of the First Way that you’re\n\nmissing. Jimmy’s problem with the auditors shows that he can’t distinguish\n\nwhat work matters to the business versus what doesn’t. And incidentally,\n\nyou have the same problem, too. Remember, it goes beyond reducing WIP.\n\nBeing able to take needless work out of the system is more important than\n\nbeing able to put more work into the system. To do that, you need to know\n\nwhat matters to the achievement of the business objectives, whether it’s\n\nprojects, operations, strategy, compliance with laws and regulations,\n\nsecurity, or whatever.”\n\nHe continues, “Remember, outcomes are what matter—not the process,\n\nnot controls, or, for that matter, what work you complete.”\n\nI sigh. Just when I think I have a concrete enough understanding of\n\nconstraints, once again Erik becomes illusive.\n\n“Don’t get distracted. Call me when you know how to throttle release of\n\nwork to Brent,” he says and hangs up.\n\nI can’t believe it. I try calling him back twice, but it rolls immediately to\n\nhis voicemail.\n\nSitting down on the bench, I lean back, take a deep breath, and force\n\nmyself to enjoy the warm morning. I hear birds chirping and the noise of\n\ntraffic from the road.\n\nThen, for the next ten minutes, I capture as much as I can remember on\n\nmy clipboard, trying to piece together what Erik covered.\n\nWhen I’m done, I head inside to call Wes and Patty. I know exactly what\n\nI need to do and am excited to get started.\n\nChapter 16 • Thursday, September 18\n\nI’m at my desk, tying up some loose ends when Ellen runs up to me, holding\n\nan e-mail printout. It’s from Dick, raising the alarm with all company\n\nexecutives that something has gone terribly wrong with the company\n\ninvoicing systems. Earlier today, one of the clerks discovered that no\n\ncustomers had been invoiced for three days. Among other things, this means\n\nthat customers haven’t been paying on time, which means the company will\n\nhave less cash in the bank at the end of the quarter than projected, which\n\nwill raise all sorts of uncomfortable questions when the company earnings\n\nare announced.\n\nIt’s clear from Dick’s string of e-mails that he’s livid, and apparently, his\n\nwhole accounts receivable staff and controller have been chain smoking and\n\ndoing damage control at all levels.\n\nFrom: Dick Landry\n\nTo: Steve Masters\n\nCc: Bill Palmer\n\nDate: September 18, 3:11 PM\n\nPriority: Highest\n\nSubject: ACTION NEEDED: Potential $50MM cash shortfall due to IT\n\nfailure\n\nALL CUSTOMER INVOICES ARE STILL STUCK OR MISSING IN THE SYSTEM.\n\nWE CAN’T EVEN RETRIEVE THEM TO MANUALLY SEND INVOICES BY E-MAIL!",

      "content": "We’re trying to figure out how we can resume normal business\n\noperations. There’s likely $50MM of receivables stuck in the system,\n\nwhich will be missing from our cash account at end of quarter.\n\nGet your IT guys to fix this. The hole this blows in our quarterly\n\nnumbers will be impossible to hide, and maybe even impossible to\n\nexplain away.\n\nCall me, Steve. I’ll be on the window ledge.\n\nDick\n\nWe’re all gathered in the NOC conference room. I’m pleased that when\n\nPatty finishes describing the incident, she quickly presented all the relevant\n\nchanges for the last seventy-two hours.\n\nAfter she’s done, I say firmly to the entire team, “First and foremost on\n\nmy mind is the risk of losing transactions. Ladies and gentlemen, I need to\n\nbe very clear about this: DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING WITHOUT GETTING\n\nAPPROVAL FROM ME. This is not an outage we’re dealing with here. We’re in\n\na situation where we could accidentally lose order entry or accounts\n\nreceivable data. This terrifies me. And that should absolutely terrify you.\n\n“As Patty said, we need timelines and hypotheses for what might have\n\ncaused the invoicing system to fail,” I say. “This is our Apollo 13 moment,\n\nand I’m Gene Kranz in Houston Mission Control. I don’t want guesswork. I\n\nwant hypotheses backed up with facts. So get back to your screens,\n\nassemble timelines and data, and I want to hear your best thinking on cause\n\nand effect. Failure is not an option.”\n\nBy 6 p.m., Patty’s team has documented over twenty different potential\n\nfailure causes that have been proposed. After further investigation, eight\n\nremain as likely possibilities. An owner has been assigned to look into each.\n\nRealizing that there’s little more we can do as a group until they\n\ncomplete their research, we agree to reconvene at 10 p.m. tonight.\n\nOn the one hand, I’m frustrated that once again, we’ve been plunged\n\ninto a crisis and our day is dominated by unplanned incident work. On the\n\nother hand, I feel a deep sense of satisfaction at the orderly nature of our\n\nincident investigation and quickly text Paige that I’ll be joining the family\n\nfor dinner shortly.\n\n“Daddy,” I hear, as I’m sitting in bed with Grant, trying to put him to sleep\n\nwhile keeping the thoughts of outages out of my head. “Why doesn’t\n\nThomas the Tank Engine have a tender car? Why?”\n\nSmiling down at him, I marvel at the questions my three-year-old son\n\ncomes up with. We’re going through our nighttime ritual of reading books.\n\nI’m glad to be doing this again, which I do every night. Or did, that is, until\n\nthe Phoenix recovery effort.\n\nMost of the lights are off, but one lamp is still dimly lit. There is a pile\n\nof books on Grant’s bed, and we’re on the third one of the night.\n\nI’m starting to get a little dry-mouthed from reading. The idea of taking\n\na little break and doing some research on the Internet on train tender cars\n\nsounds pretty appealing.\n\nI love how inquisitive my kids are and how much they love books, but\n\nthere are nights when I’m so exhausted that I’ve actually fallen asleep\n\nduring our nightly ritual. My wife will walk in, find me asleep with one of\n\nGrant’s books lying on top of my face and Grant asleep beside me.\n\nDespite how tired I am, I’m grateful to be at home early enough to\n\nresume my nighttime ritual with my older son.\n\n“Yes, we need to find out, Daddy,” Grant demands. I smile at him, and I\n\ndig my phone out from my pocket, intending to do a Google search for\n\n“tank engine tender car.”\n\nBut first, I quickly scan my phone for any new updates on the customer\n\ninvoicing problem. I’m amazed at the difference two weeks can make.\n\nDuring the last Sev 1 incident that hit our credit card processing\n\nsystems, the conference call was full of finger-pointing, denials, and, most\n\nimportantly, wasted time when our customers couldn’t give us money.\n\nAfterward, we did the first of a series of ongoing blameless\n\npostmortems to figure out what really happened and come up with ideas on\n\nhow to prevent it from happening again. Better yet, Patty led a series of\n\nmock incident calls with all hands on deck, to rehearse the new procedures.\n\nIt was terrific to watch. Even Wes saw the value.\n\nI’m pleased to see all the e-mails indicating a lot of good information\n\nand effective discussion among the teams working the problem. They’ve\n\nkept the telephone conference bridge and a chat room open for people\n\nworking the issue, and I plan on calling in at 10 p.m. to see how it’s going.\n\nThat’s forty-five minutes from now. Plenty of time to spend with Grant,\n\nwho should be falling asleep soon.\n\nHe nudges me, obviously expecting more progress on the research front.\n\n“Sorry, Granty. Daddy got distracted,” I say as I open up the browser.\n\nI’m surprised by how many of the search results are all about Thomas the\n\nTank Engine. It’s the book series that spawned a multibillion dollar\n\nfranchise of toy trains, clothing, videos, and coloring books. With two sons,\n\nwe seem destined to own two of every item soon.\n\nI’m reading a promising Wikipedia entry on trains when my phone starts\n\nvibrating and the screen displays “Call from Steve Masters.”\n\nI groan and double-check my watch. It’s 9:15 p.m.\n\nI’ve had way too many meetings and phone calls with Steve lately. In\n\nmy head, I wonder how many of these meetings I can take.\n\nOn the other hand, after the Phoenix debacle, every outage and incident\n\nis trivial in comparison, right?\n\nI say gently, “Hang on, Grant. Daddy has to take a phone call. I’ll be\n\nright back.” I jump out of his bed and walk into the dark hallway.\n\nI’m glad I had just scanned through all the e-mail traffic on the outage\n\njust seconds before. I take a deep breath before I hit the button to answer\n\nthe call.\n\nI say, “Bill here.”\n\nSteve’s loud voice booms in my ear. “Evening, Bill. I’m glad you’re\n\nthere. Of course you know about the customer invoicing problems from\n\nDick?”\n\n“Yes, of course,” I reply, surprised at his tone. “My team declared a\n\nmajor incident early this afternoon and we’ve been working this issue ever\n\nsince. I’ve been sending out status reports every hour. Dick and I spent\n\ntwenty minutes on the phone earlier this evening. I know the problem is\n\nserious, and my team is following the process we’ve created after the\n\npayroll failure. I’m completely satisfied that the process is working.”\n\n“Well I just got off the phone with Dick, and he tells me that you’re\n\ndragging your feet,” says Steve, clearly very angry. “Obviously, I’m not\n\ncalling you at night because I want to chitchat. Do you understand how\n\nintolerable this is? Yet another IT screwup jeopardizing everything. Cash is\n\nthe lifeblood of the company, and if we can’t invoice customers, we can’t\n\nget paid!”\n\nFalling back on old training on handling frustrated people, I calmly\n\nreiterate what I already stated. “As I said, I talked with Dick earlier today.\n\nHe very much impressed upon me all the implications. We’ve activated our\n\nnew incident process, and we’re methodically looking into what could have\n\ncaused the failure. They’re doing exactly what I want them to, because with\n\nso many moving pieces, it’s way too easy to make things worse by jumping\n\nto conclusions—”\n\n“Are you in the office?” Steve demands, cutting me off before I could\n\nfinish.\n\nHis question genuinely catches me off guard.\n\n“Uh… No, I’m at home,” I answer.\n\nIs he worried that I’ve delegated the problem away? To reinforce my\n\nrole in handling the crisis and what my expectations from my team are, I\n\nsay, “I will be calling into the war bridge line at ten o'clock. As always, we\n\nhave a duty officer on site, and those on my staff who need to be in the\n\noffice are there already.”\n\nFinally, I ask bluntly, “Steve, want to tell me what’s on your mind? I’m\n\non top of this situation. What do you need that you aren’t getting right\n\nnow?”\n\nHe responds hotly, “What I need from you is a goddamned sense of\n\nurgency. Dick and his team are burning the midnight oil trying to figure out\n\nhow our quarter will end up in six working days. But I think I already know\n\nwhat the answer will be.”\n\nHe continues, “We’ll probably miss almost every target that we’ve\n\npromised the board: revenue, cash, receivables—everything. In fact, every\n\nmeasure we’ve promised the board is going the wrong way! This screwup\n\nmay confirm the board’s suspicion that we’ve completely lost control of\n\nmanaging this company!”\n\nSteve is almost snarling now as he says, “So, what I want from you, Bill,\n\nis to stay sufficiently on top of things, so that I don’t have my CFO saying\n\nthat you’re dragging your feet. The house is burning down, and all I hear\n\nfrom you is about drawing pictures and timelines. What in the hell is wrong\n\nwith you? You afraid to get people out of bed?”\n\nI start again, “Steve, if I thought it would help, I’d have everyone pull\n\nall-nighters in the data center tonight. For Phoenix, some people didn’t go\n\nhome for nearly a week. Trust me, I know the house is on fire, but right\n\nnow, more than anything, we need situational awareness. Before we send\n\nthe teams crashing through the front door with fire hoses, we have to have\n\nsomeone at least quickly walk the perimeter of the yard—otherwise, we’ll\n\nend up burning down the houses next door!”\n\nI realize that I’ve raised my voice in the relative quiet of our house as\n\nwe’re trying to get the kids to sleep. I resume, more quietly, “And just in\n\ncase you forgot, during the payroll outage, we made the outage worse by\n\nour own actions. We probably could have completed the payroll run during\n\nthe business day if someone hadn’t started screwing with the SAN. Because\n\nof that, we added another six hours to the outage, and we nearly lost payroll\n\ndata!”\n\nMy hopes that the calm voice of reason is reaching him are dashed when\n\nI hear him say, “Oh, yeah? I don’t think your team agrees with you. What\n\nwas the name of that smart guy who you introduced me to? Bob? No, Brent.\n\nI talked with Brent earlier today, and he’s very skeptical of your approach.\n\nHe thinks what you’re doing is separating people who actually do the work\n\nfrom what needs to get done. What is Brent doing right now?”\n\nShit.\n\nI like transparency. I always try to make my team totally accessible to\n\nmy boss and the business. But there’s always risk in doing this.\n\nLike having Brent spout off his crazy theories to the CEO.\n\n“I hope Brent is at home, because that’s exactly where he should be,” I\n\nrespond. “Until we know for sure exactly what went wrong, that’s where I\n\nwant him. Look, it’s rocket scientists like him that often cause the problem\n\nin the first place. Every time we escalate to Brent, we perpetuate our\n\nreliance on him, and make it that much less likely we can fix things without\n\nhim!”\n\nSuspecting that I may be losing Steve, I start again. “The chaotic way\n\nwe currently work, Brent is having to fix the punctured hulls almost every\n\nday. I’m pretty sure, though, that Brent is one of the main reasons the hull is\n\npunctured in the first place. It’s not malicious, of course, but it’s just a side\n\neffect of the way we work and fix outages here.”\n\nThere is a pause. Then he says slowly and decisively, “I’m glad you’re\n\nbeing so professorial about this, but we’ve got a goddamned fire that’s out\n\nof control. Up until now, we’ve done it your way. And now we’re going to\n\ndo it my way.\n\n“I want you to call Brent in, and I want him to roll up his sleeves and\n\nhelp fix this outage. And not just Brent. I want all eyeballs on screens and\n\nall hands on keyboards. I’m Captain Kirk. You’re Scotty. And I need warp\n\nspeed, so get your goddamned engineers off their asses! Do you understand\n\nme?”\n\nSteve is yelling so loudly by now that I’m holding the phone away from\n\nmy ear.\n\nSuddenly, I’m furious. Steve is going to screw this up again.\n\nRecalling my days in the Marines, I finally say, “Permission to speak\n\nfreely, sir?”\n\nI hear Steve on the other end of the line snort dismissively in response.\n\n“Yes, dammit.”\n\n“You think I’m being overly cautious, and that I’m hesitating to do what\n\nneeds to be done. But you are wrong. Dead wrong,” I say adamantly. “If\n\nyou do what I think you’re suggesting, which is basically ‘all hands on\n\ndeck,’ I predict that we’re going to make things much worse.”\n\nI continue, “I tried to advise you of something very similar before the\n\nPhoenix launch. Up until now, we have not been sufficiently disciplined in\n\nhow we work outages. Given all the complexity and moving pieces, there’s\n\ntoo much likelihood of causing another problem. I may not know exactly\n\nwhat caused the customer invoicing issue, but I know enough to absolutely\n\nconclude that what you’re proposing is a very bad idea. I recommend\n\ncontinuing along the lines I am currently prosecuting.”\n\nI hold my breath, waiting to hear how he reacts.\n\nHe says slowly, “I’m sorry you feel that way, Bill, but the drawers open\n\non my side of the desk. I’m telling you that it’s now DEFCON 1, so go get the\n\nsmartest people working on this problem. And I want status updates on this\n\nIT failure every two hours until it’s fixed. Understood?”\n\nBefore I can think about what to say, I find myself saying, “I don’t know\n\nwhy you need me to do that. You’re talking directly to my people, and\n\nyou’re calling all shots on the ground. Do it yourself. I can’t be held\n\nresponsible for the results of this FUBAR situation.”\n\nAnd before I hang up on him, I say with finality, “And expect my\n\nresignation in the morning.”\n\nI wipe the sweat off my forehead, and look up from my phone to see my\n\nwife Paige staring at me wide-eyed.\n\n“Are you insane? You just quit? Just like that? How are we going to pay\n\nthe bills now?” she asks, her voice rising.\n\nI turn the ringer off on my phone and put it back in my pocket, saying,\n\n“Honey, I’m not sure how much of that conversation you heard, but let me\n\nexplain…”\n\nChapter 17 • Monday, September 22\n\nIn the four days since quitting, Paige has been fretting endlessly. On the\n\nother hand, I’m amazed at how much better I’m sleeping at night, as if\n\nsome huge, hidden weight has been lifted from my shoulders.\n\nUninterrupted by e-mails or emergency pages, the weekend was\n\nincredibly peaceful. I was still receiving them on Thursday, but I just\n\ndeleted the e-mail accounts and blocked the text messages.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nI tell Paige not to take Grant to her mother’s. Instead, I’m taking him on\n\nan adventure. Paige reacts with a bemused smile and helps me pack his\n\nThomas the Tank Engine backpack.\n\nBy 8 a.m., we’re out of the house and heading happily to the train\n\nstation, where, for months, I’ve been promising to take him. For an hour we\n\nwatch trains go by, and I’m continually amazed at Grant’s unabashed joy.\n\nDespite the uncertainty around what I’ll be doing next, I feel blessed that I\n\ncan share this moment with Grant.\n\nAs I’m taking pictures of Grant screaming with delight and pointing at\n\nthe diesel trains going by, I realize how few pictures I’ve taken of either of\n\nmy kids in the last month.\n\nWe’re still watching the trains when my phone rings. It’s Wes. I let it\n\nroll to voicemail.\n\nHe calls several more times, and each time he leaves another voicemail.\n\nThen Patty calls, which I let roll to voicemail, too. After three more\n\ncalls, I mutter in exasperation, “For chrissakes, guys…”",

With surprising anger in her voice, she\n\ncontinues, “I’ve got Wes here, and we’re both completely shocked. We\n\nknew something wasn’t right when you didn’t show up for our regular CAB\n\nmeeting on Friday. I just can’t believe you resigned during this outage—and\n\nafter everything we’ve achieved!”\n\n“Look, guys, it has nothing to do with you,” I explain. “Steve and I just\n\nhad some irreconcilable differences about how to resolve the big invoicing\n\nfailure. I’m sure you guys will do fine without me.”\n\nAs I say the last part, I feel slightly disingenuous.\n\n“Well, we’ve pretty much screwed the pooch since you’ve left,” Wes\n\nsays, sounding genuinely abashed, confirming my worst fears. “Steve\n\ninsisted that we bring in all the engineers, including Brent. He said he\n\nwanted a ‘sense of urgency’ and ‘hands on keyboards, not people sitting on\n\nthe bench.’ Obviously, we didn’t do a good enough job coordinating\n\neveryone’s efforts, and…”\n\nWes doesn’t finish his sentence. Patty picks up where he left off, “We\n\ndon’t know for sure, but at the very least, the inventory management\n\nsystems are now completely down, too. No one can get inventory levels in\n\nthe plants or warehouses, and they don’t know which raw materials we need\n\nto replenish. All the finance guys are about to jump from window ledges,\n\nbecause they may not be able to close the books for the quarter on time.\n\nWith all these systems down, no one has the data they need to compute cost\n\nof goods sold, gross profit, and net margin.”\n\n“Holy shit.” Speechless for a moment, I finally say, “That’s incredible.”\n\nGrant grabs at my phone, demanding my attention. I say, “Look, guys,\n\nI’m with my son, and we’re in the middle of something important. I can’t\n\ntalk for very long. But rest assured that I’m really proud of everything that\n\nwe’ve done together, and I know that you guys can get through this crisis\n\nwithout me.”\n\n“That’s a load of junk, and you know it,” Patty says. “How can you\n\nleave us in the lurch like this? We have so many things that we planned on\n\nfixing together, and you’re leaving it all completely unfinished! I never\n\nfigured you as someone who would quit like this!”\n\n“I agree. Leaving now is pretty shitty, if you ask me,” Wes says, chiming\n\nin.\n\nI sigh. I’m never going to tell them about all the frustrating and absurd\n\nmeetings I’ve had to put up with Steve. That’s between him and me.\n\n“I’m sorry to let you down, but it’s something that I had to do,” I say.\n\n“You’ll do just fine. Just don’t let Steve or anyone else micromanage you.\n\nNo one knows the IT systems like you guys do, so don’t let anyone try to\n\ncall the shots, okay?”\n\nI hear Wes mutter, “Too late for that.”\n\nBy now, Grant is trying to hang up my phone. “Guys, I’ve got to run.\n\nWe’ll catch up later, okay? Over beers.”\n\n“Yeah, sure,” Wes says.\n\n“Gee, thanks for everything,” Patty says. “Catch you around.”\n\nWith that, the line disconnects.\n\nI let out a long sigh. Then, looking at Grant, I put away my phone and\n\ngive him my full attention again, intent on recapturing our moment of\n\nhappiness before it was interrupted.\n\nMy phone rings again on our drive home. Grant is asleep in the backseat.\n\nThis time, it’s Steve.\n\nHaving no interest in talking with him just yet, I let it go to voicemail.\n\nThree times.\n\nI pull into our garage and get out of the car, trying to get Grant out of his\n\ncar seat without waking him up. As I walk through the house with him, I see\n\nPaige. I point to Grant, silently mouthing to her, “Asleep.” I pad softly up\n\nthe stairs, at last transferring him to his bed and taking off his shoes.\n\nWith a sigh of relief, I close the door behind me and walk back\n\ndownstairs.\n\nWhen Paige sees me, she says, “That bastard Steve called me this\n\nmorning. I almost hung up on him, but he gave me a long story about doing\n\nall this soul-searching with some guy named Erik. He says he has a\n\nproposition for you. I told him I’d pass along the message.”\n\nWhen I roll my eyes, she says in a suddenly concerned voice, “Look, I\n\nknow you resigned because you felt it was the right thing to do. But you\n\nknow as well as I do that there aren’t many other companies in town that\n\npay as well as Parts Unlimited. Especially after your promotion. I don’t\n\nwant to move away from my family.”\n\nShe looks levelly at me. “Honey, I know he’s a bastard, but we both still\n\nneed to earn a living. Promise me that you’ll listen to what Steve has to say\n\nand keep an open mind, okay? Bill? Okay?”\n\nI merely nod and step into the dining room, hitting the speed dial for\n\nSteve.\n\nSteve answers his cell phone on the first ring. “Good afternoon, Bill.\n\nThanks for calling me back. I had the pleasure of talking with your wife,\n\ntelling her all about what a jackass I’ve been.”\n\n“Yeah, she said something to that effect,” I respond. “She said that you\n\nreally wanted to talk.”\n\nI hear him say, “Look, I wanted to apologize for the way I’ve behaved\n\nsince you graciously accepted my request to become our VP of IT\n\nOperations. Dick thought I was crazy when I told him that I was going to\n\nhave IT report to me. But I told him about how, when I first became a plant\n\nmanager, many decades ago, I worked on the assembly line for a month,\n\njust to make sure that I understood the ins and outs of daily life of everyone\n\nwho worked there.\n\n“I promised Dick that I would get my hands dirty and not just delegate\n\nthe problem away. I’m angry with myself that I haven’t lived up to that\n\npromise. And delegating all the IT issues to Sarah was a total screwup.\n\n“Listen, I know I haven’t been fair to you, especially when you’ve\n\nfulfilled your end of the bargain. You’ve been a straight shooter, and you’ve\n\ngenuinely tried to prevent bad things from happening.”\n\nHe pauses for a couple of moments. “Look, I just got kicked in the ass\n\nby Erik and by the entire audit committee. He held my feet to the fire until I\n\nfinally understood something. It made me realize that I’ve been doing\n\nsomething really wrong for many years, and I want to make it right.\n\n“In short, I’d like you to resume your role as VP of IT Operations,\n\neffective immediately. I’d like to work with you, as Erik coined it, as the\n\ntwo sides of a dysfunctional marriage. Maybe the two of us together can\n\nfigure out what is really going wrong with how IT is managed here at Parts\n\nUnlimited.\n\n“I’m convinced that IT is a competency that we need to develop here. All\n\nI’m asking is that you spend ninety days with me and give it a try. And if at\n\nthe end of the ninety days you still want to bail, then you can do so, with a\n\none-year severance package.”\n\nRemembering my promise to Paige, I choose my words carefully.\n\n“You’ve been pretty consistent in being, as you say, a complete jackass for\n\nthe past month. I’ve been very consistent in presenting to you my analyses\n\nand recommendations, over and over again. And each time, you’ve crapped\n\non it. Why should I trust you now?”\n\nForty-five minutes later, after Steve continually tries to woo me back, I\n\nhang up the phone and go back into the kitchen where Paige is waiting to\n\nhear what happened.\n\nChapter 18 • Tuesday, September 23\n\nThe next morning, I’m driving into work at 6:30 a.m. for Steve’s IT\n\nleadership off-site. He’s calling it an off-site, even though the meeting is in\n\nBuilding 2.\n\nEarlier this morning, I padded softly into Grant and Parker’s rooms to\n\nsay goodbye. Watching Parker sleep, I kissed him and whispered softly,\n\n“Sorry that daddy couldn’t take you on an adventure today. It was your turn,\n\nbut Daddy has to go back to work. This weekend, I promise.”\n\nThis better be worth it, Steve.\n\nThe meeting is in the corporate boardroom. Walking onto the fifteenth\n\nfloor, I still can’t believe how different it is than all the other buildings.\n\nChris, Wes, and Patty are already here, all holding coffee cups and plates\n\nfull of pastries.\n\nPatty barely acknowledges my presence.\n\nWes greets me loudly, saying sarcastically, “Hey, Bill. Nice to see you. I\n\nhope you don’t quit again today.”\n\nThanks, Wes.\n\nChris acknowledges me with an understanding smile, rolling his eyes\n\nand making the motions of getting a beer. I nod and smile, and turn to the\n\nback of the room.\n\nMy mood brightens when I see the Vandal Doughnuts in back, and I\n\nstart loading up my paper plate. As I’m trying to decide whether having six\n\ndoughnuts on my plate is a breach of social protocol, I feel a hand clap me\n\non my shoulder.",

      "content": "It’s Steve. “Good to see you again, Bill. I’m glad you’re here.” Looking\n\ndown at my overflowing plate, he laughs loudly. “Why not just take the\n\nentire platter with you?”\n\n“Good idea. Glad to be here,” I reply.\n\nErik takes a seat right across from me, saying, “Morning, Bill.” Behind\n\nhim is a large suitcase that he had lugged in.\n\nI squint at the suitcase. The last time I saw a suitcase without wheels\n\nwas in my mother’s attic twenty years ago.\n\nErik’s hair is dripping wet, soaking the shoulders of his denim shirt.\n\nWas he running late this morning and had to run out of his hotel without\n\ndrying his hair? Or does he look like this every morning?\n\nWhere exactly did Steve find this guy?\n\n“Good morning,” Steve says, addressing the room. “First, I appreciate\n\neveryone making it here so early. Especially since I know that you and your\n\nteams have been working incredibly long hours over the last two weeks.”\n\n“Ha!” Erik snorts. “That’s probably the understatement of the century.”\n\nEveryone laughs nervously, going to extra lengths to not make eye\n\ncontact with anyone else.\n\nSteve smiles sadly. “I know that the last couple of weeks have been\n\nharrowing. I now realize just how much responsibility I bear for all of this.\n\nNot just for the Phoenix disaster, but everything leading up to the audit\n\nissues, the customer invoicing and inventory failures over the last couple of\n\ndays, and the trouble we’re having with the auditors.”\n\nHe stops, obviously distraught and needing a moment to compose\n\nhimself.\n\nIs he tearing up?\n\nNow here’s a side of Steve you don’t see every day. What the heck\n\nhappened to Steve after I left?\n\nHe puts down an index card that he’s been holding, shrugs his shoulders\n\nand gestures to Erik. “Erik described the relationship between a CEO and a\n\nCIO as a dysfunctional marriage. That both sides feel powerless and held\n\nhostage by the other.”\n\nHis fingers worry at the card. “There are two things I’ve learned in the\n\nlast month. One is that IT matters. IT is not just a department that I can\n\ndelegate away. IT is smack in the middle of every major company effort we\n\nhave and is critical to almost every aspect of daily operations.”\n\nHe says, “I know that right now, nothing, absolutely nothing, is more\n\nimportant to the company’s success than how this leadership team performs.\n\n“The second thing I’ve learned is that my actions have made almost all\n\nour IT problems worse. I turned down Chris and Bill’s requests for more\n\nbudget, Bill’s request for more time to do Phoenix right, and micromanaged\n\nthings when I wasn’t getting the results I wanted.”\n\nSteve then looks at me. “The person I wronged the most was Bill. He\n\ntold me things that I didn’t want to hear, and I shut him down. In hindsight,\n\nhe was completely right, and I was completely wrong. And for that, Bill,\n\nI’m very sorry.”\n\nI see Wes’ jaw drop open.\n\nCompletely embarrassed, I merely say, “All water under the bridge now.\n\nLike I said to you yesterday, Steve, apology not expected, but appreciated.”\n\nSteve nods and looks at his card for several moments. “The huge\n\nchallenges ahead of us will require an outstanding team operating at their\n\nabsolute best. Yet, we don’t completely trust one another. I know that I am\n\npartially to blame, but that needs to end now.\n\n“Over the weekend, I thought back on my career, which as you may\n\nknow, could end at any moment, as my board has made clear. I know that\n\nmy most rewarding times were always when I was part of a great team.\n\nThat goes for both my professional and personal life.\n\n“A great team doesn’t mean that they had the smartest people. What\n\nmade those teams great is that everyone trusted one another. It can be a\n\npowerful thing when that magic dynamic exists.\n\nSteve continues, “One of my favorite books about team dynamics is\n\nFive Dysfunctions of a Team, by Patrick Lencioni. He writes that in order to\n\nhave mutual trust, you need to be vulnerable. So, I’m going to tell you a\n\nlittle about myself and what makes me tick. And then I’m going to ask you\n\nto do the same.\n\n“It may make you uncomfortable, but it’s part of what I need from you\n\nas leaders. If you can’t do it for yourself, do it for the livelihood of the\n\nnearly four thousand Parts Unlimited employees and their families. I don’t\n\ntake that responsibility lightly, and you shouldn’t either.”\n\nOh, shit. That’s another part of “management off-sites” I forgot about.\n\nTouchy-feely crap.\n\nSteve ignores the skyrocketing tension in the room as everyone, like me,\n\nputs up their deflector shields. “My family was dirt poor, but I’m extremely\n\nproud to be the first one to actually make it to college. No one before me\n\nmade it out of high school. Growing up in rural Texas, my parents worked\n\nin a cotton mill. During the summers, my brothers and I were too young to\n\nwork there, so we’d pick cotton in the fields.”\n\nPeople picked cotton in the last century? I quickly do the math in my\n\nhead, wondering if this was possible.\n\n“So there I am, on top of the world at the University of Arizona. My\n\nparents don’t have money to pay tuition, so I find a job at a copper mine.\n\n“I don’t know if OSHA existed back then, but if they visited that mine,\n\nthey would have shut it down. It was dangerous and filthy.” He points at his\n\nleft ear, saying, “I lost most of my hearing in this ear when some explosives\n\nwent off too close to me.\n\n“I finally get my first big break when I land a job at a pipe\n\nmanufacturing plant, helping with equipment maintenance. This is the first\n\njob where I’m paid to think.\n\n“I study management, and more than anything, I want to go into sales\n\nafter college. From what I see at the plant, those sales guys have the best\n\njobs in the world. They get paid to wine and dine clients, and they travel\n\nfrom city to city, seeing what all the best factories are doing.”\n\nSteve shakes his head ruefully. “But that’s not how it turns out. To help\n\npay for school, I join ROTC where I get my first glimpse of what kids from\n\nmiddle-class America are like. And it means that after college, instead of\n\ngoing to work in industry, I have to fulfill my obligations to the US Army,\n\nwhich is where I discover my love for logistics. I make sure materials get to\n\nwhere they need to. Soon, I have a reputation of being the go-to guy when\n\nyou really need just about anything.”\n\nI’m riveted. Steve’s a good storyteller.\n\n“But it’s hard being a poor country hick, surrounded by people from\n\nprivileged families. I feel like I need to prove myself to everyone. I’m\n\ntwenty-five years old, and I still have fellow officers constantly calling me\n\ndumb and slow because of my accent and upbringing…” he says, as his\n\nvoice cracks slightly.\n\n“It makes me even more determined to prove myself. After nine years,\n\nI’m ready to leave the Army after a distinguished career. Right before I’m\n\ndischarged, my commanding officer tells me something that changes my\n\nlife.\n\n“He says that although I’ve gotten consistently high ratings over the\n\nyears, without exception, none of the people who served under me would\n\nwant to work with me again. He tells me that if there were an Asshole of the\n\nDecade Award, I’d win by a wide margin. And that if I want to make\n\nsomething of myself, I need to get this fixed.”\n\nIn the corner of my eye, I see Wes roll his eyes at Chris, who pointedly\n\nignores him.\n\n“I know what you’re thinking,” Steve says, nodding at Wes. “But it’s\n\none of the most crushing moments of my life, and I realize that I’ve made a\n\ncritical mistake in how I was living my life, betraying my own values.\n\n“Over the next three decades, I became a constant student of building\n\ngreat teams that really trust one another. I did this first as a materials\n\nmanager, then later as a plant manager, as head of Marketing, and later, as\n\nhead of Sales Operations. Then twelve years ago, Bob Strauss, our CEO at\n\nthe time, hired me to become the new COO.”\n\nSteve exhales slowly, rubbing his face, suddenly looking very tired and\n\nold. “Somehow, I’ve made the wrong turn again, just like I did in the Army.\n\nI’ve become that person I promised myself I’d never be again.”\n\nHe stops talking and looks around the room. The silence goes on for a\n\nlong time as we watch him stare out the window. The bright sun is starting\n\nto stream in through the conference room windows.\n\nSteve says, “We have big problems in front of us that we need to fix.\n\nErik is right. IT is not just a department. IT is a competency that we need to\n\ngain as an entire company. And I know that if we can reforge ourselves into\n\na great team, where we can all trust one another, we can succeed.”\n\nHe then says, “Are you guys willing to do what it takes to help create a\n\nteam where we can all trust one another?”\n\nSteve looks around the table. I see that everyone is looking back at him\n\nwith rapt attention.\n\nThe silence lengthens uncomfortably.\n\nChris is the first to speak. “I’m in. Working in a screwed up team sucks,\n\nso if you’re offering to help fix it, I’m all for it.”\n\nI see Patty and Wes also nodding, and then everyone turns to look at me.\n\nChapter 19 • Tuesday, September 23\n\nAt last, I nod, too.\n\nPatty says, “You know, Bill, I think you’ve done a fantastic job in the\n\npast couple of weeks. And I’m sorry for how I reacted when you quit. I’ve\n\nseen such a difference in how the entire IT organization works. This is an\n\norganization that has resisted adopting any sort of process and had real\n\nproblems with trust between departments. It’s amazing to see, and I give\n\nmost of the credit to you.”\n\n“I’m with her. I suppose I’m glad you’re back, too, you big quitter,” Wes\n\nlaughs loudly. “Whatever I might have said on that first day, I don’t want\n\nyour job. We need you here.”\n\nEmbarrassed, I just smile, acknowledging their remarks but not wanting\n\nthem to blather on, saying, “Okay. Thanks, guys.”\n\nSteve nods, watching our interaction. At last, he says, “Let’s go around\n\nthe table and have each of you share something from your personal history.\n\nWhere were you born? How many siblings did you have and where did you\n\nfit in? What childhood events helped form you as an adult?”\n\nSteve continues, “The goal of this exercise is to get to know one another\n\nas people. You’ve learned a bit about me and my vulnerabilities. But that’s\n\nnot enough. We need to know more about one another. And that creates the\n\nbasis for trust.”\n\nHe looks around. “Who wants to go first?”\n\nOh, shit.",

      "content": "Marines don’t like this kind of touchy-feely stuff. I immediately avert\n\nmy eyes, not wanting to be called on first.\n\nMuch to my relief, Chris volunteers.\n\nHe starts off, “I was born in Beirut as the youngest of three children.\n\nBefore the age of eighteen, I had lived in eight different countries. As a\n\nresult, I speak four languages.”\n\nChris tells us about how he and his wife tried for five years to have\n\nchildren, the agony of having to administer the fertility treatment injections\n\nto her, and just not being able to go through it a third time.\n\nThen he tells about the miracle of having identical twin boys, only to\n\nhave complications, and having to stay with his wife in the intensive care\n\nunit for three months after they were born prematurely. And spending night\n\nafter night, praying that they would be okay, and not wanting one twin to\n\nlive his life without the other when they were destined to be able to\n\nunderstand each other in a way that no other person in the world could.\n\nAnd how this experience taught him how selfish he was and his\n\nnewfound desire to be unselfish.\n\nTo my surprise, I blink back tears, seeing Chris’ earnest aspirations for\n\nhis kids’ future. I furtively notice others doing the same.\n\n“Thank you for sharing, Chris,” says Steve solemnly after a moment and\n\nthen looks around the room. “Who’s next?”\n\nTo my surprise and relief, Wes goes next.\n\nI learn that he’s been engaged three times in his life, and at the last\n\nminute, called off each one. And when he finally does get married, he\n\nquickly got divorced because she was tired of his maniacal car racing habit.\n\nHow can a guy who weighs nearly 250 pounds race cars?\n\nWes has four cars, and even if he weren’t a Parts Unlimited employee,\n\nhe would be one of our most fanatic customers. He spends most of his off-\n\nhours working on his Mazda Miata and old Audi that he races competitively\n\nalmost every weekend. Apparently, he’s struggled with a life-long battle to\n\nlose weight, even as a young child. He talked about being the outcast.\n\nHe still battles his weight. Not to make friends or for his health, but to\n\ntry to keep up with the skinny Asian teenage car racers half his age, even\n\ngoing to weight-loss camp. Twice.\n\nThere is a long silence.\n\nI’m too nervous to laugh.\n\nSteve finally says, “Thanks for sharing, Wes. Who’s next?”\n\nI purse my lips together and am again relieved when Patty raises her\n\nhand.\n\nWe learn that she was actually an art major. She’s one of those people\n\nI’ve made fun of all my life? But she seems so reasonable!\n\nShe tells us what it’s like growing up being the “smart girl with big\n\nboobs and glasses,” trying to decide what to do in life. She switched majors\n\nfive times in college, dropping out to become a singer-songwriter in Athens,\n\nGeorgia, spending two years touring clubs around the country with her\n\nband. She went back to get her MFA but after confronting the potential\n\npoverty of making a living as an artist, applied to work at Parts Unlimited.\n\nShe almost didn’t get the job because of a civil disobedience arrest that was\n\nstill on her record.\n\nWhen Patty stops talking, Steve thanks her. And then smiling at my\n\ndiscomfort, he says, “Thank you. That leaves you, Bill…”\n\nEven though I’ve known this moment is coming, the room seems to fade out.\n\nI hate talking about myself. In the Marines, I was able to create a\n\npersona where I could just yell at people and tell them what needed to be\n\ndone. I got paid to keep my people alive by being slightly smarter than they\n\nwere and having great vocal cords.\n\nI do not share my feelings with work colleagues.\n\nOr with almost anyone, for that matter.\n\nI look at the notepad in front of me, where I’ve been writing down ideas\n\nof what to share. All I see is nervous doodling.\n\nThe silence is nearly absolute, with everyone now looking at me\n\nexpectantly. Not impatiently, I see. Instead, they seem patient and kind.\n\nI see Patty’s expression turn sympathetic.\n\nI purse my lips together for a moment, and then just blurt out, “What\n\ninfluenced me most? When I realized that my mom did everything for us,\n\nand that my dad was completely undependable. He was an alcoholic and\n\nwhen things weren’t going well, all my brothers and sisters hid from him.\n\nBut it got to a point where I finally had enough and ran away. And I left\n\nthem behind. And my youngest sister was only eight years old.”\n\nI keep going, “You know, getting arrested was one of the best things that\n\never happened to me. The alternative was having to go home. So instead, I\n\njoined the Marines. That introduced me to an entirely new world, where I\n\nlearned that there was a totally different way of living your life. It taught me\n\nthat you could be rewarded by doing things right and taking care of your\n\nfellow soldiers.\n\n“What did I learn? That my main goal is to be a great father, not like the\n\nshitty father I had. I want to be the man that my sons deserve.” I feel tears\n\nstarting to fall down my cheeks, which I wipe away, angry that my body is\n\nbetraying me.\n\n“That good enough for you, Steve?” I say with a lot more anger than I\n\nhad intended.\n\nSteve nods with a half smile, saying slowly, “Thank you, Bill. I know\n\nthat was as difficult for you as it was for all of us.”\n\nI exhale slowly. And breathe deeply one more time, trying to regain\n\nsome equilibrium that I hadn’t realized I’d lost.\n\nThe uncomfortable silence goes on.\n\n“I know this isn’t my place to say, Bill,” Wes says slowly. “But, I’m\n\npretty sure your dad would be incredibly proud of you. And he would\n\nrealize what a total piece of shit he was, compared to you.”\n\nI hear laughter around the table, and Patty says quietly, “I agree with\n\nWes. Those kids of yours are luckier than they’ll ever know.”\n\nWes grunts in agreement, and Chris nods at me. And I find myself\n\ncrying for the first time in over thirty years.\n\nEmbarrassed, I pull myself together and look up at everyone.\n\nI’m relieved to see everyone shifting mental gears and turning their\n\nattention back to Steve, who looks around the room.\n\n“First, I’d like to thank all of you for giving of yourself and doing that\n\nexercise with me,” he says. “Although it’s nice to get to know each of you\n\nbetter, I wouldn’t do this if I didn’t think it was important. Solving any\n\ncomplex business problem requires teamwork, and teamwork requires trust.\n\nLencioni teaches that showing vulnerability helps create a foundation for\n\nthat.\n\n“I know it’s unrealistic to think we’re going to leave this meeting\n\nknowing exactly what we need to do, with priorities and owners assigned,”\n\nhe continues. “But I would like to have a joint vision as we move toward a\n\nsolution.”\n\nSteve puts both hands in front of him, and says, “Just to get the ball\n\nrolling, I’d like to propose that one of our main problems is that we blow\n\nevery commitment and schedule that we make. People outside of IT are\n\nalways grumbling that we miss whatever expectations we set. By a mile.\n\n“Which makes me think,” he says, looking around the room, “that we’re\n\nprobably not good at making internal commitments to one another here\n\nwithin IT. Thoughts?”\n\nUncomfortable silence.\n\n“Look, I don’t want to split hairs,” Chris finally says defensively. “But if\n\nyou look at the actual metrics, my group has delivered almost every major\n\nproject on time. We make our dates.”\n\n“Yeah, just like you hit the Phoenix date, right?” Wes says, jeering.\n\n“Now that was a huge success. I heard Steve was really proud of your\n\nperformance last week.”\n\nChris turns red, raising both hands in front of him. “That’s not what I\n\nmeant.” He thinks for a moment, adding, “It was a total disaster. But,\n\ntechnically, we did hit the date.”\n\nInteresting.\n\n“If that’s true,” I say, digging in, “there’s something really wrong with\n\nour definition of what a ‘completed project’ is. If it means ‘Did Chris get all\n\nhis Phoenix tasks done?’ then it was a success. But if we wanted Phoenix in\n\nproduction that fulfilled the business goals, without setting the entire\n\nbusiness on fire, we should call it a total failure.”\n\n“Let’s stop pussyfooting here,” Steve interrupts. “I’ve told Sarah that\n\nPhoenix was one of the worst executed projects in the history of our\n\ncompany. What’s a better definition of success?”\n\nThinking for a moment, I finally say, “I don’t know. But this is a\n\nrecurring pattern. Chris’ group never factors in all the work that Operations\n\nneeds to do. And even when they do, they use up all the time in the\n\nschedule, leaving none for us. And we’re always left cleaning up the mess,\n\nlong afterward.”\n\nChris nods understandingly. “Well, you and I are fixing some of this.\n\nPart of it is a planning and architecture issue, which you and I have talked\n\nabout fixing. But you’re underestimating how much of a bottleneck your\n\ngroup is. We’ve got a bunch of other applications that need to be deployed,\n\nbut because your team is tied up, all the other deployments waiting in line\n\nget delayed as well.”\n\nHe adds, “On any given week, we’ve got five or six application groups\n\nwaiting in line for your group to deploy something or another. And when\n\nanything goes wrong, everything gets stacked up. No offense, but when you\n\nguys are late, it’s like an airport that closes down. Before you know it, you\n\nhave a bunch of airplanes circling, all waiting to land.”\n\nWes grumbles loudly, “Yeah, well, that’s what happens when the\n\nairplane you’ve built crash lands, totally destroying the runway.”\n\nThen Wes raises a placating hand. “Look, I’m not blaming you, Chris.\n\nI’m just stating a well-known fact. When deployments don’t go as planned,\n\nwhether the plan was written by your group or mine, it affects everybody\n\nelse. That’s all I’m saying.”\n\nI nod, agreeing with Wes’ characterization. And surprisingly, Chris is\n\nnodding, as well.\n\nI reply, “Erik has helped me understand that there are four types of IT\n\nOperations work: business projects, IT Operations projects, changes, and\n\nunplanned work. But, we’re only talking about the first type of work, and\n\nthe unplanned work that get’s created when we do it wrong. We’re only\n\ntalking about half the work we do in IT Operations.”\n\nI turn to look at Steve, saying, “I showed you our project list. On top of\n\nthe thirty-five business projects, we’ve got another seventy-five or so Ops\n\nprojects we’re working. We’ve got a backlog of thousands of changes that\n\napparently all need to execute for some reason or another. On top of that,\n\nwe have an ever increasing amount of unplanned work, mostly caused by\n\nall our fragile applications breaking, which includes Phoenix.”\n\nI say flatly, “We are way over capacity, given the amount of work in\n\nfront of us. And we haven’t even counted properly the big audit finding\n\nremediation project yet, which Steve says is still top-priority.”\n\nI see the understanding start to dawn on Steve and Chris.\n\nSpeaking of which…\n\nI look around, puzzled. “Hey, where’s John? If we’re talking about\n\ncompliance, shouldn’t he be here, too? And isn’t he a part of the IT\n\nleadership team as well?”\n\nWes groans softly, rolling his eyes, saying, “Oh, great, that’s just who\n\nwe need.”\n\nSteve looks startled. He looks at the index card he was holding earlier.\n\nThen he runs his finger down a printed calendar in front of him. “Shit. I\n\nforgot to invite him.”\n\nChris mutters, “Well, we were getting so much done. It was probably a\n\nblessing in disguise, right?”\n\nThere’s more uncomfortable laughter, but people seem embarrassed that\n\nwe’re making fun of John without him here.\n\n“No, no, no, that’s not what I meant,” Steve says quickly, looking most\n\nembarrassed of all. “Bill is right—we need him here. Everyone, let’s take a\n\nfifteen-minute break. I’m going to have Stacy track him down.”\n\nI decide to take a walk to clear my head.\n\nWhen I return in ten minutes, I see the strewn remains of a corporate\n\nmeeting in progress: Styrofoam cups half-filled with coffee, plates of\n\nleftover food, crumpled up napkins.\n\nAcross the room, Patty and Wes are having an animated discussion with\n\nChris. At the other end of the table, Steve is talking on his cell phone with\n\nsomeone, while Erik looks at the pictures of automotive parts hanging on\n\nthe wall.\n\nI’m considering joining Patty and Wes when I see John walk in the\n\nroom. Underneath his arm, of course, is the black three-ring binder.\n\n“Stacy said you were looking for me, Steve?” he said. He makes a point\n\nof looking around slowly at the evidence of a meeting started without him\n\nlong ago. “Did I miss a meeting notice? Or did I just get left out from yet\n\nanother one?”\n\nAs almost everyone goes to extraordinary lengths to avoid eye contact\n\nwith him, he says even more loudly, “Hey, it smells like people just had sex\n\nin here. Did I miss anything good?”\n\nChris, Patty, and Wes break off their conversation, and with exaggerated\n\nnonchalance, grab their original seats.\n\n“Ah, good, you’re here. I’m glad you could make it,” says Steve,\n\nappearing completely unfazed. “Please grab a seat. Everyone, let’s get\n\nstarted again.”\n\n“John, my apologies for not sending you an invite. It’s completely my\n\nfault,” Steve says, as he makes his way to the head of the table. “I organized\n\nthis meeting yesterday at the last minute, right after the audit committee\n\nmeeting. After recognizing my part in making all the IT problems worse, I\n\nwanted to assemble the IT leadership team to see if we could agree on a\n\ngeneral direction of the solution to the issues we’re having around projects,\n\noperational stability, and compliance.”\n\nJohn looks at me questioningly, lifting an eyebrow.\n\nI’m curious at Steve’s omission of the vulnerability exercise and all that.\n\nProbably he figured if he can’t redo it, he might as well not even bring it up.\n\nI nod reassuringly at John.\n\nSteve turns to me. “Bill, please continue.”\n\n“When you brought up the word commitment, it reminded me of\n\nsomething Erik asked me last week that stuck with me,” I say. “He asked on\n\nwhat basis do we decide whether we can accept a new project. When I said\n\nthat I didn’t know, he took me on another tour of MRP-8 manufacturing\n\nplant. He took me to Allie, the Manufacturing Resource Planning\n\nCoordinator, and asked her how she decides on whether to accept a new\n\norder.”\n\nI flip back to my notes. “She said that she would first look at the order\n\nand then look at the bill of materials and routings. Based on that, she would\n\nlook at the loadings of the relevant work centers in the plant and then\n\ndecide whether accepting the order would jeopardize any existing\n\ncommitments.\n\n“Erik asked me how we made the same type of decision in IT,” I recall.\n\n“I told him then, and I’ll tell you now, I don’t know. I’m pretty sure we\n\ndon’t do any sort of analysis of capacity and demand before we accept\n\nwork. Which means we’re always scrambling, having to take shortcuts,\n\nwhich means more fragile applications in production. Which means more\n\nunplanned work and firefighting in the future. So, around and around we\n\ngo.”\n\nTo my surprise, Erik interrupts. “Well put, Bill. You’ve just described\n\n‘technical debt’ that is not being paid down. It comes from taking shortcuts,\n\nwhich may make sense in the short-term. But like financial debt, the\n\ncompounding interest costs grow over time. If an organization doesn’t pay\n\ndown its technical debt, every calorie in the organization can be spent just\n\npaying interest, in the form of unplanned work.”\n\n“As you know, unplanned work is not free,” he continues. “Quite the\n\nopposite. It’s very expensive, because unplanned work comes at the\n\nexpense of…”\n\nHe looks around professorially for an answer.\n\nWes finally speaks up, “Planned work?”\n\n“Precisely!” Erik says jovially. “Yes, that’s exactly right, Chester. Bill\n\nmentioned the four types of work: business projects, IT Operations projects,\n\nchanges, and unplanned work. Left unchecked, technical debt will ensure\n\nthat the only work that gets done is unplanned work!”\n\n“That sure sounds like us,” Wes says nodding. He then looks firmly at\n\nErik, saying, “And it’s Wes, not Chester. I’m Wes.”\n\n“Yes, I’m sure you are,” Erik says agreeably.\n\nHe addresses the rest of the room. “Unplanned work has another side\n\neffect. When you spend all your time firefighting, there’s little time or\n\nenergy left for planning. When all you do is react, there’s not enough time\n\nto do the hard mental work of figuring out whether you can accept new\n\nwork. So, more projects are crammed onto the plate, with fewer cycles\n\navailable to each one, which means more bad multitasking, more\n\nescalations from poor code, which mean more shortcuts. As Bill said,\n\n‘around and around we go.’ It’s the IT capacity death spiral.”\n\nI’m smile to myself at Erik mangling Wes’ name. I’m not sure what kind\n\nof mental game he’s playing, but it’s amusing to watch.\n\nUncertain, I ask Steve, “Are we even allowed to say no? Every time I’ve\n\nasked you to prioritize or defer work on a project, you’ve bitten my head\n\noff. When everyone is conditioned to believe that no isn’t an acceptable\n\nanswer, we all just became compliant order takers, blindly marching down a\n\ndoomed path. I wonder if this is what happened to my predecessors, too.”\n\nWes and Patty nod slightly.\n\nEven Chris nods.\n\n“Of course you can say no!” Steve replies heatedly, with a look of\n\ngenuine irritation on his face. He then takes a deep breath before saying,\n\n“Let me be clear. I need you to say no! We cannot afford to have this\n\nleadership team be order takers. We pay you to think, not just do,\n\ngoddamnit!”\n\nSteve looks increasingly angry, saying, “What’s at stake here is the\n\nsurvival of the company! The outcomes of these projects dictate whether\n\nthis entire company succeeds or fails!”\n\nHe looks right at me. “If you, or for that matter, anyone knows that a\n\nproject will fail, I need you to say so. And I need it backed up with data.\n\nGive me data like that plant coordinator showed you, so we can understand\n\nwhy. Sorry, Bill, I like you a lot, but saying no just based on your gut is not\n\nenough.”\n\nErik snorts and mutters, “That’s some pretty nice, soaring rhetoric,\n\nSteve. Very moving. But you know what your problem is? You guys in the\n\nbusiness are punch drunk on projects, taking on new work that doesn’t have\n\na prayer of succeeding. Why? Because you have no idea what capacity you\n\nactually have. You’re like the guy who is always writing checks that\n\nbounce, because you don’t know how much money you have and never\n\nbother opening your mail.\n\n“Let me tell you a story,” he says. “Let me tell you about what that MRP-\n\n8 plant was like before I arrived. Those poor bastards would get these\n\nmanila envelopes that would just show up, containing all sorts of crazy\n\norders. The business would make absurd commitments to ship something at\n\nsome impossible date, oblivious to all the work already in the system.”\n\nHe continues, “It was a nightmare everyday. They had inventory piled\n\nup to the ceiling. And was there a systematic way to get WIP through the\n\nplant? Hell, no! What got worked on was based on who yelled the loudest\n\nor most often, who could engineer the best side deals with the expediters, or\n\nwho could get the ear of the highest ranking executive.”\n\nErik is as animated as I’ve ever seen him. “We started restoring sanity\n\nwhen we figured out where our constraint was. Then we protected it,\n\nmaking sure that time on the constraint was never wasted. And we did\n\neverything to make sure work flowed through it.”\n\nErik then grows still and merely says, “To fix your problem, you need to\n\ndo a lot more than just learning how to say no. That’s the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nWe all look at him, waiting for him to keep going. But instead, he stands\n\nup, walks to his suitcase, and opens it, revealing a jumble of clothes, a\n\nsnorkel, a garbage bag, and boxer shorts.\n\nHe starts digging, takes out a granola bar, closes the suitcase, and\n\nreturns to the table.\n\nWe all watch as he opens up the granola bar package and starts eating it.\n\nSteve, looking as mystified as the rest of us, eventually says, “Erik,\n\nthat’s an intriguing story. Please keep going.”\n\nErik sighs. “No, that’s all I intended to say. If you can’t figure out from\n\nthat what you need to do, then there’s really not much hope for any of you.”\n\nSteve slaps the table, exasperated.\n\nBut my mind is racing.\n\nWhat we need to do isn’t merely to prioritize better. I’ve already learned\n\nwhat the priorities are, however inconvenient: Phoenix. Making the audit\n\nfindings go away. All while keeping everything running.\n\nWe think we know where the constraint is. It’s Brent. Brent, Brent,\n\nBrent. And we’ve already taken steps to protect Brent from unplanned\n\nwork.\n\nI know I can’t hire more resources.\n\nI also know that the workload in my organization is totally out of\n\ncontrol.\n\nNo amount of heroics on my part can make a big dent in the tidal wave\n\nof work that’s been allowed to get into the system. Because no one ever said\n\nno.\n\nOur mistakes were made long before it came to me. The mistakes were\n\nmade by accepting the project and all the resulting shortcuts that Chris had\n\nto make before it reached me.\n\nHow can we reverse this insanity?\n\nThen a strange idea hits me.\n\nI think about it for another moment. It sounds utterly absurd, yet I can’t\n\nfind any flaws in the logic.\n\nI say, “Steve, I have an idea. But please let me finish telling you the\n\nentire idea before you react.”\n\nAnd I tell them what I’m thinking.\n\nSteve is the first to speak. “You must be out of your goddamned mind,”\n\nSteve says, his initial disbelief turning into exasperation. “You want to just\n\nstop doing work? Who do you think we are? Subsidized potato farmers paid\n\nnot to grow crops?”\n\nBut before I can respond, John speaks up. “I agree. Your idea seems like\n\nexactly the wrong thing to do. We’ve got a burning platform right now to\n\nfinally do the right thing. We need to strike while the iron is hot. This is a\n\nperfect storm for us to finally get the budget we need to not only do the\n\nright things, but do the right things right.”\n\nHe starts rattling off the points on his fingers, “We’ve got the audit\n\nfinding that has board visibility, the high-visibility project that can’t fail,\n\nand an operational failure that can’t happen again, either. We should pour\n\non the gas and put in the security controls we need, once and for all.”\n\nWes interjects, chortling to John, “I’m stunned! I thought you would\n\nlove Bill’s idea. I mean, you love stopping things from getting done and\n\nsaying no, right? This should be like a dream come true for you!”\n\nJohn turns bright red, obviously preparing a scathing reply. But Wes\n\nputs his big, meaty hand on his shoulder, and says with a smile, “Hey, I’m\n\njust kidding, okay? Just making a joke.”\n\nEveryone starts talking at once when Erik suddenly stands up, crumples\n\nhis granola bar wrapper, and throws it across the room into the wastebasket.\n\nHe leans back in his chair, saying, “Bill, I think your proposal is very\n\nastute.”\n\nLooking at John, he continues, “Remember, Jimmy, the goal is to\n\nincrease the throughput of the entire system, not just increase the number of\n\ntasks being done. And if you don’t have a trustworthy system of work, why\n\nshould I trust your system of security controls? Bah. A total waste of time.”\n\nJohn looks back at Erik, puzzled. “What?”\n\nErik sighs and rolls his eyes. Instead of responding to John, he turns his\n\ngaze to Steve. “You’ve been a plant manager. Think of it as freezing\n\nmaterials release until enough WIP completes and leaves the plant. In order\n\nto control this system, we need to reduce the number of moving parts.”\n\nWhen Steve doesn’t appear convinced, Erik leans way forward in his\n\nchair and asks him pointedly, “Suppose you’re managing the MRP-8 plant,\n\nand you have inventory piled to the ceiling. What would happen if you\n\nstopped releasing jobs and materials onto the plant floor?”\n\nSurprised to be the target of the question, Steve considers it for a\n\nmoment. “The amount of WIP in the plant goes down, because work will\n\nstart leaving the plant as finished goods.”\n\n“Correct,” Erik says, nodding approvingly. “And what will likely\n\nhappen to due-date performance?”\n\n“Due-date performance goes up, because WIP went down.” Steve says,\n\nlooking increasingly suspicious and reluctant about where Erik might be\n\nleading him.\n\n“Yes, very good,” Erik says encouragingly. “But on the other hand, what\n\nhappens to inventory levels if you allow the plant to continue to accept\n\norders and release new jobs?”\n\nHe says after a moment, “WIP goes up.”\n\n“Excellent,” Erik says. “And what happens to due-date performance?”\n\nSteve looks like he’s just swallowed something that isn’t agreeing with\n\nhim, and he says eventually, “Everyone knows that in manufacturing, as WIP\n\nincreases, due-date performance goes down.\n\n“Wait a goddamned minute, here,” he says, squinting at Erik. “You’re\n\nnot actually suggesting that this applies to IT, too? That by halting all work\n\nexcept for Phoenix, we’ll reduce the amount of WIP in IT, and that this will\n\nsomehow improve due-date performance? Is that seriously what you’re\n\nsuggesting?”\n\nErik leans back in his chair looking pleased with himself. “Yes.”\n\nWes says, “Won’t that leave most of us just twiddling our thumbs with\n\nnothing to do? That’s 130 people in IT Operations just sitting around.\n\nDoesn’t that sound a bit…wasteful?”\n\nErik scoffs and says, “I’ll tell you about wasteful. How about over a\n\nthousand changes stuck in the system, with no apparent way of ever getting\n\nthem completed?”\n\nWes frowns. Then he nods, saying, “That’s true. The number of cards on\n\nPatty’s change board keeps going up. If that’s work in process, it’s\n\ndefinitely spiraling out of control. We’re probably only a couple weeks\n\naway from having those cards stacked to the ceiling, too.”\n\nI nod. He’s right.\n\nThe idea is for IT Operations and Development to not accept any new\n\nprojects for two weeks and to stop all work in IT Operations except for work\n\nrelated to Phoenix.\n\nI look around. “If we single-task on the most important project for two\n\nweeks and still aren’t able to make a big dent, then I think we should all\n\nfind new day jobs.”\n\nChris nods. “I think we should give it a shot. We’ll keep working on the\n\nother active projects, but we’ll freeze all deployment work except Phoenix.\n\nFrom Bill’s perspective, it will look like that’s the only thing we’re working\n\non. Make no mistake, Phoenix will be everyone’s top priority.”\n\nPatty and Wes nod in agreement.\n\nJohn crosses his arms. “I’m not sure if I can support this insane\n\nproposal. First, I’ve never seen any organization do anything even remotely\n\nlike this before. Second, I’m very concerned that if we do this, we’ll lose\n\nour shot at getting all the audit issues fixed. As Steve has already said, those\n\naudit findings could kill the company, too.”\n\n“You know what your problem is?” Erik says, pointing a finger at John.\n\n“You never see the end-to-end business process, so I guarantee you that\n\nmany of the controls you want to put in aren’t even necessary.”\n\nJohn says, “What?”\n\nAgain, Erik waves John’s question away. “Don’t worry about it for now.\n\nLet the inevitable happen, and we’ll see what we can learn from it.”\n\nSteve turns to John. “I understand your concerns about security. But the\n\nbiggest risk to the company is not the unresolved audit findings. The\n\nbiggest risk to the company is that we don’t survive. We need Phoenix to\n\nregain competitive parity.”\n\nHe pauses and says, “Let’s give this project freeze one week and see if it\n\nmakes a difference in the Phoenix work. If we don’t, we’ll put the\n\nremediation work back on the front burner. Okay?”\n\nJohn nods reluctantly. He then flips to a page in his three-ring binder,\n\nand makes some notes. He’s probably recording Steve’s promise.\n\n“Steve, we definitely need your help to make this happen,” I say. “My\n\nguys are routinely strong-armed into doing pet projects by almost every\n\nmanager in this company. I think we need an e-mail from you to the entire\n\ncompany, not only explaining why you’re doing this, but what the\n\nconsequences will be if someone tries to put unauthorized work into the\n\nsystem.”\n\nErik makes an encouraging noise.\n\n“No problem,” Steve quickly replies. “I’ll send you all a draft after this\n\nmeeting. Revise it and I’ll send it out to all the company managers. Good\n\nenough for you?”\n\nTrying to keep the disbelief out of my voice, I say, “Yes.”\n\nIt’s astonishing what we agree to in the next hour. IT Operations will\n\nfreeze all non-Phoenix work. Development can’t idle the twenty-plus non-\n\nPhoenix projects, but will freeze all deployments. In other words, no work\n\nwill flow from Development to IT Operations for another two weeks.\n\nFurthermore, we will identify the top areas of technical debt, which\n\nDevelopment will tackle to decrease the unplanned work being created by\n\nproblematic applications in production.\n\nThis will all make a huge difference in my team’s workload.\n\nFurthermore, Chris and Kirsten will review all Phoenix tasks not being\n\nworked, and steal resources from other projects to get them in work again.\n\nEveryone seems energized and excited to put the plan into place—even\n\nJohn.\n\nBefore we all leave, Steve says, “Thank you all for your good thinking\n\ntoday and for sharing something about yourself. I feel like I know all of you\n\nbetter now. And, as unbelievable as I think Bill’s crazy project freeze idea\n\nis, I think it could work. I look forward to this being the first of many great\n\ndecisions this team will make.\n\n“As I said, one of my goals is that we create a team where we can all\n\ntrust one another,” he continues. “Hopefully, we made a small step in that\n\ndirection, and I encourage you to keep demanding honest and truthful\n\ncommunications between you.”\n\nHe looks around the room and asks, “Is there anything that you guys\n\nneed from me in the meantime?”\n\nThere are no requests, so we adjourn.\n\nAs we all get up to leave, Erik says loudly, “Great work, Bill. Couldn’t\n\nhave done it better myself.”\n\nChapter 20 • Friday, September 26\n\nThree days later, I’m at my desk, trying to read a report on Phoenix\n\nprogress from Kirsten on my laptop. As it whirs and wheezes, I wonder how\n\nmany weeks it’s been since John’s security patch bricked my laptop.\n\nGetting replacement laptops is like a lottery. It’s tempting to bribe one of\n\nthe service desk people, as one of the Marketing managers suggested, but I\n\nrefuse to jump the queue. I have to keep playing by the rules since I’m the\n\nperson responsible for making and enforcing them. I make a note to talk\n\nwith Patty about our urgent need to reduce lead times on these laptop\n\nreplacements.\n\nFinally, the e-mail comes up:\n\nFrom: Kirsten Fingle\n\nTo: Steve Masters,\n\nCc: Bill Palmer, Chris Allers, Sarah Moulton\n\nDate: September 26, 10:33 AM\n\nSubject: Great news on project front!\n\nSteve,\n\nWe are finally making headway. The project freeze and the\n\nresulting IT focus on Phoenix has broken the logjam. We’ve\n\naccomplished more in the previous seven days that we typically get\n\ndone in an entire month.\n\nKudos to everyone on the team!",

      "content": "On a side note: many project sponsors are very frustrated about\n\ntheir projects being put on hold. In particular, Sarah Moulton believes\n\nthat her projects are exempt from the freeze. I referred her to you.\n\nAttached is the formal status report. Please let me know if you\n\nhave any questions.\n\nKirsten\n\nAlthough the note about Sarah making trouble again makes my jaw\n\nclench, this is absolutely fantastic news.\n\nWe were expecting it, but the good news is welcome, nonetheless,\n\nespecially after earlier in the week. We had a big setback because of a Sev 1\n\nincident that took out all the internal phone and voicemail systems, bringing\n\nSales and Manufacturing to its knees on the last day of the quarter.\n\nTwo hours into the outage, we discovered it was caused by one of our\n\nnetworking vendors who accidentally made a change to our production\n\nphone system instead of the hot spare.\n\nThe outage will impact our quarterly revenue, but we don’t know how\n\nmuch yet. In order to prevent this from happening again, we’re putting\n\ntogether a project to monitor our critical systems for unauthorized changes.\n\nThis monitoring project is what Wes, Patty, and John are talking about,\n\nhuddled around Patty’s conference table.\n\nI say, “Sorry to interrupt, but I wanted to share the good news.” I show\n\nthem Kirsten’s e-mail.\n\nWes leans back and says, “Well, that makes it official. Your project\n\nfreeze is actually working.”\n\nPatty looks over at him, appearing surprised. “You actually doubted it?\n\nCome on, we’ve both been talking about how we’ve never seen people so\n\nfocused before. It’s amazing how the project freeze has reduced the priority\n\nconflicts and bad multitasking. We know it’s made a huge difference in\n\nproductivity.”\n\nWes shrugs then smiles. “Until Kirsten gives us credit, it’s all just in our\n\nheads.”\n\nHe’s got a point. It really is great to have Kirsten acknowledge the\n\nprogress we’re making.\n\n“By the way,” Patty says, “She’s is not kidding about the business\n\nmanagers freaking out. I’ve had more and more VPs calling me, demanding\n\na waiver for their various pet projects or asking to get some work done off\n\nthe books. It’s not just Sarah—she’s just the most blatant and vocal.”\n\nI frown. “Okay, that’s part of our job and we expected this. But, I don’t\n\nwant this kind of pressure being applied to any of our people. Wes?”\n\n“I’ve told everyone on my team that they’re to route any complaints to\n\nme. And trust me, I call each of those guys back and give them an earful,”\n\nhe says.\n\nPatty says, “I’m already getting anxious about what we do after we lift\n\nthe project freeze. Won’t that be like opening up the floodgates?”\n\nOnce again, she has put her finger on something important. I say, “I’ll\n\ncall Erik, but before I do, how do we currently prioritize our work? When\n\nwe commit to work on a project, a change, a service request, or anything\n\nelse, how does anyone decide what to work on at any given time? What\n\nhappens if there are competing priorities?”\n\n“That happens every freaking day!” says Wes, looking incredulous.\n\n“That’s what’s so great about freezing all the projects except for one. No\n\none has to decide what they’re working on. No multitasking allowed.”\n\n“That’s not my question,” I say. “When we have multiple streams of\n\nwork going on simultaneously, how does anyone decide what needs to get\n\nworked on at any given time?”\n\n“Well,” Wes says, “we trust them to make the right decision, based on\n\nthe data they have. That’s why we hire smart people.”\n\nThis is not good.\n\nRecalling my twenty minutes observing Brent before the project freeze,\n\nI ask, “And on what data do all our smart people base their prioritization\n\ndecisions?”\n\nWes says defensively, “We all try to juggle the competing priorities as\n\nbest as we can. That’s life, right? Priorities change.”\n\n“Let’s be honest,” Patty says. “Priority 1 is whoever is yelling the\n\nloudest, with the tie-breaker being who can escalate to the most senior\n\nexecutive. Except when they’re more subtle. I’ve seen a bunch of my staff\n\nalways prioritizing a certain manager’s requests, because he takes them out\n\nto lunch once a month.”\n\nOh, great. In addition to some engineers being bullied, I have other\n\nengineers who are like Corporal Max Klinger from M*A*S*H, running their\n\nown black market of IT work.\n\n“If this is true, there’s no way we can lift the project freeze. Don’t you\n\nsee that we don’t have any way of releasing work into IT and be able to trust\n\nthat it will get worked on?”\n\nTrying to keep the resignation out of my voice, I say, “Patty is right. We\n\nhave a lot to figure out before the project freeze ends. Which is in exactly\n\none week.”\n\nI decide to take a quick walk outside. I have thirty minutes before my next\n\nmeeting, and I need to think.\n\nI’m more unsettled than ever. When we have more than one project in\n\nthe system at the same time, how do we protect the work from being\n\ninterrupted or having its priority trumped by almost anyone in the business\n\nor someone else in IT?\n\nThe sun shines down on me. It’s 11 a.m., and the air smells like autumn.\n\nThe leaves on the trees are starting to turn orange and brown, and there are\n\npiles of them starting to form in the parking lot.\n\nDespite my fretting, I realize how refreshing it is to be able to think\n\nabout what work we need to be doing and how to prioritize and release it.\n\nFor a moment, I marvel at the lack of constant firefighting that dominated\n\nso much of my career in IT.\n\nThe types of issues we’re having to solve lately are so…cerebral.\n\nIt’s what I thought management was all about when I got my MBA.\n\nI’m convinced that if we do a good job thinking, we can make a real\n\ndifference. In that moment, I decide to call Erik.\n\n“Hello?” I hear him say.\n\n“Hi, it’s Bill. Do you have a couple of minutes to talk? I have some\n\nquestions about the project freeze.” I pause, and then add, “Or rather, what\n\nhappens after we lift the project freeze.”\n\n“Well, it’s about time. I was wondering when you’d figure out that you\n\nhave a huge, new problem on your hands.”\n\nI quickly fill him in on the good news from Kirsten. I outline the\n\nproblems we’ve stumbled upon while we consider the monitoring project\n\nand how we protect work in the system.\n\n“Not bad, junior!” Erik says. “You’ve obviously put our discussion\n\nabout constraints into practice and are doing everything you can to protect\n\nthat constraint from being hit by unplanned work. You’re asking some very\n\nimportant questions about the First Way and how you manage your flow of\n\nplanned work. Until you can do that, you can’t really manage much of\n\nanything, can you?\n\n“You’re confused because you’re realizing you don’t know how work is\n\nactually worked,” he continues.\n\nI suppress an irritated sigh.\n\n“I think it’s time for another trip to MRP-8. How soon can you get\n\nthere?” he asks.\n\nSurprised, I ask, “You’re in town?”\n\n“Yep” he says. “There’s a meeting with the auditors and the finance\n\nguys this afternoon that I wouldn’t miss for the world. Make sure you’re\n\nthere for it. We’re going to make John’s head fall off.”\n\nI tell him that I can be at MRP-8 in fifteen minutes.\n\nErik’s in the middle of the lobby waiting for me.\n\nI do a double take. He’s wearing a faded T-shirt and a zippered, hooded\n\nsweatshirt with a faded union logo. He already has a visitor badge and is\n\ntapping his foot impatiently.\n\n“I came as fast as I could.” I say.\n\nErik merely grunts and gestures for me to follow him. Again, we climb\n\nthe staircase and stand on the catwalk overlooking the plant floor.\n\n“So tell me what you see,” he says, gesturing toward the plant floor.\n\nI look down, confused, not knowing what he wants to hear. Starting with\n\nthe obvious, I say, “Like last time, I see raw materials coming in from the\n\nloading docks on the left. And on the right, I see finished goods leaving the\n\nother set of loading docks.”\n\nSurprisingly, Erik nods approvingly. “Good. And in between?”\n\nI look down at the scene. Part of me feels foolish, afraid of looking like\n\nthe Karate Kid being quizzed by Mr. Miyagi. But I asked for this meeting,\n\nso I just start talking. “I see materials and work in process, flowing from\n\nleft to right—but, obviously, moving very slowly.”\n\nErik peers over the catwalk, and says, “Oh, really? Like some sort of\n\nriver?”\n\nHe turns to me, shaking his head with disgust, “What do you think this\n\nis, some sort of poetry reading class? Suddenly, WIP is like water running\n\nover smooth stones? Jesus. Get serious. How would a plant manager answer\n\nthe question? From where to where does the work go, and why?”\n\nTrying again, I say, “Okay, okay. WIP goes from work center to work\n\ncenter, as dictated by the bill of materials and routings. And all that is in the\n\njob order, which was released at that desk over there.”\n\n“That’s better,” Erik says. “And can you find the work centers where the\n\nplant constraints are?”\n\nI know that Erik had told me on that first odd trip to this plant.\n\n“The heat treat ovens and paint curing booths,” I say suddenly.\n\n“There,” I say, after scanning the plant floor and finally spotting a set of\n\nlarge machines by the far wall. “And there,” I say, pointing at the large\n\nrooms with signs saying, “Paint Booth #30-A” and “Paint Booth #30-B.”\n\n“Good. Understanding the flow of work is key to achieving the First\n\nWay,” Erik says, nodding. More sternly, he asks, “So now, tell me again\n\nwhich work centers you’ve determined to be the constraints in your\n\norganization?”\n\nI smile, answering easily, “Brent. We talked about that before.”\n\nHe scoffs, turning back to look at the plant floor.\n\n“What?” I nearly shout. “How can it not be Brent? You even\n\ncongratulated me when I told you it was Brent a couple of weeks ago!”\n\n“Suddenly Brent is a robotic heat treat oven? You’re telling me your\n\nequivalent of that paint curing booth down there is Brent?” he says with\n\nmock disbelief. “You know, that might be the dumbest thing I’ve ever\n\nheard.”\n\nHe continues, “So, where would that leave your two managers, Chester\n\nand Penelope? Let me guess. Maybe they’re equivalent to that drill press\n\nstation and that stamping machine over there? Or maybe it’s that metal\n\ngrinder?”\n\nErik looks sternly at me, “Get serious. I asked you what work centers\n\nare your constraints. Think.”\n\nCompletely confused, I look back down at the plant floor.\n\nI know that part of the answer is Brent. But when I blurt it out so\n\nconfidently, Erik all but smacks me on the head. Again.\n\nErik seems aggravated that I named an actual person, suggesting that\n\nBrent was a piece of equipment.\n\nI look again at the heat treat oven. And then I see them. There are two\n\npeople wearing coveralls, hard hats, and goggles. One is in front of a\n\ncomputer screen, punching in something, while the other is inspecting a pile\n\nof parts on a loading pallet, scanning something with his handheld\n\ncomputer.\n\n“Oh,” I say, thinking out loud. “The heat treat oven is a work center,\n\nwhich has workers associated with it. You asked what work centers are our\n\nconstraints, and I told you that it was Brent, which can’t be right, because\n\nBrent isn’t a work center.\n\n“Brent is a worker, not a work center,” I say again. “And I’m betting\n\nthat Brent is probably a worker supporting way too many work centers.\n\nWhich is why he’s a constraint.”\n\n“Now we’re getting somewhere!” Erik says, smiling. Gesturing broadly\n\nat the plant floor below, he says, “Imagine if twenty-five percent of all the\n\nwork centers down there could only be operated by one person named\n\nBrent. What would happen to the flow of work?”\n\nI close my eyes to think.\n\n“Work wouldn’t complete on time, because Brent can only be at one\n\nwork center at a time,” I say. Enthusiastically, I continue, “That’s exactly\n\nwhat’s happening with us. I know that for a bunch of our planned changes,\n\nwork can’t even start if Brent isn’t on hand. When that happens, we’ll\n\nescalate to Brent, telling him to drop whatever he’s doing, so some other\n\nwork center can get going. We’ll be lucky if he can stay there long enough\n\nfor the change to be completely implemented before he’s interrupted by\n\nsomeone else.”\n\n“Exactly!” he says.\n\nI’m slightly dismayed at the warm feeling of approval that I feel in\n\nresponse.\n\n“Obviously,” he continues, “every work center is made up of four\n\nthings: the machine, the man, the method, and the measures. Suppose for\n\nthe machine, we select the heat treat oven. The men are the two people\n\nrequired to execute the predefined steps, and we obviously will need\n\nmeasures based on the outcomes of executing the steps in the method.”\n\nI frown. These factory terms are vaguely familiar from my MBA years.\n\nBut I never thought they’d be relevant in the IT domain.\n\nLooking for some way to write this down, I realize I left my clipboard in\n\nmy car. I pat my pockets and find a small crumpled index card in my back\n\npocket.\n\nI hurriedly write down, “Work center: machine, man, method, measure.”\n\nErik continues, “Of course, on this plant floor, you don’t have one\n\nquarter of the work centers dependent upon one person. That would be\n\nabsurd. Unfortunately for you, you do. That’s why when Brent takes a\n\nvacation, all sorts of work will just grind to a halt, because only Brent\n\nknows how to complete certain steps—steps that probably only Brent even\n\nknew existed, right?”\n\nI nod, unable to resist groaning. “You’re right. I’ve heard my managers\n\ncomplain that if Brent were hit by the proverbial bus, we’d be completely\n\nup the creek. No one knows what’s in Brent’s head. Which is one of the\n\nreason I’ve created the level 3 escalation pool.”\n\nI quickly explain what I did to prevent escalations to Brent during\n\noutages to keep him from being interrupted by unplanned work and how\n\nI’ve attempted to do the same thing for planned changes.\n\n“Good,” he says. “You’re standardizing Brent’s work so that other\n\npeople can execute it. And because you’re finally getting those steps\n\ndocumented, you’re able to enforce some level of consistency and quality,\n\nas well. You’re not only reducing the number of work centers where Brent\n\nis required, you’re generating documentation that will enable you to\n\nautomate some of them.”\n\nHe continues, “Incidentally, until you do this, no matter how many more\n\nBrents you hire, Brent will always remain your constraint. Anyone you hire\n\nwill just end up standing around.”\n\nI nod in understanding. This is exactly as Wes described it. Even though\n\nhe got the additional headcount to hire more Brents, we never were able to\n\nactually increase our throughput.\n\nI feel a sudden sense of exhilaration as the pieces fall into place in my\n\nhead. He’s confirming some of my deeply held intuitions and providing an\n\nunderpinning theory for why I believe them.\n\nMy elation is short-lived. He looks me over disapprovingly, “You’re\n\nasking about how to lift the project freeze. Your problem is that you keep\n\nconfusing two things. Until you can separate them in your head, you’ll just\n\nwalk around in circles.”\n\nHe starts walking and I hurry after him. Soon, we’re standing over the\n\nmiddle of the plant floor.\n\n“You see that work center over there, with the yellow blinking light?” he\n\nasks, pointing.\n\nWhen I nod, he says, “Tell me what you see.”\n\nWondering what it would take to have a normal conversation with him, I\n\nresume my dumb trainee role. “Some piece of machinery is apparently\n\ndown—that’s what I’m guessing the blinking light indicates. There are five\n\npeople huddled off to the side, including what looks like two managers.\n\nThey all look concerned. There are three more people crouched down,\n\nlooking into what I’m guessing is the machine inspection panel. They have\n\nflashlights and—yeah—they’re also holding screwdrivers—definitely a\n\nmachine down…”\n\n“Good guess,” he says. “That’s probably a computerized grinder that is\n\nout of commission, and the maintenance team is working on getting it back\n\nonline. What would happen if every piece of equipment down there needs\n\nBrent to fix it?”\n\nI laugh. “Every outage escalated immediately to Brent.”\n\n“Yes.” He continues, “Let’s start with your first question. Which\n\nprojects are safe to release when the project freeze is lifted? Knowing how\n\nwork flows through certain work centers and how some work centers\n\nrequire Brent and some do not, what do you think the answer is?”\n\nI slowly repeat what Erik just recited, trying to piece together the answer\n\n“I got it,” I say, smiling. “The candidate projects which are safe to\n\nrelease are those that don’t require Brent.”\n\nI smile even wider when he says, “Bingo. Pretty simple, yes?”\n\nMy smile disappears as I think through the implications. “Wait, how do\n\nI know which projects don’t require Brent? We never think we actually\n\nneed Brent until we’re halfway through the work!”\n\nI immediately regret asking the question as Erik glares at me. “I’m\n\nsupposed to give you the answer to everything that you’re too disorganized\n\nto be able to figure out for yourself?”\n\n“Sorry. I’ll figure it out,” I say quickly. “You know, I’ll be so relieved\n\nwhen we finally know all the work that actually requires Brent.”\n\n“Damn right,” he says. “What you’re building is the bill of materials for\n\nall the work that you do in IT Operations. But instead of a list of parts and\n\nsubassemblies, like moldings, screws, and casters, you’re cataloging all the\n\nprerequisites of what you need before you can complete the work—like\n\nlaptop model numbers, specifications of user information, the software and\n\nlicenses needed, their configurations, version information, the security and\n\ncapacity and continuity requirements, yada yada…”\n\nHe interrupts himself, saying, “Well, to be more accurate, you’re\n\nactually building a bill of resources. That’s the bill of materials along with\n\nthe list of the required work centers and the routing. Once you have that,\n\nalong with the work orders and your resources, you’ll finally be able to get\n\na handle on what your capacity and demand is. This is what will enable you\n\nto finally know whether you can accept new work and then actually be able\n\nto schedule the work.”\n\nAmazing. I think I almost get it.\n\nI’m about ask some questions, but Erik says, “Your second question was\n\nwhether it was safe to start your monitoring project. You already established\n\nit doesn’t require Brent. Furthermore, you say that the goal of this project is\n\nto prevent outages, which prevents Brent escalations. More than that, when\n\noutages do occur, you’ll need less of Brent’s time to troubleshoot and fix.\n\nYou’ve already identified the constraint, exploited it to squeeze the most out\n\nof it, and then you’ve subordinated the flow of work to the constraint. So,\n\nhow important is this monitoring project?”\n\nI think for a moment. And then groan at the obvious answer.\n\nI run my fingers through my hair. “You said that we always need to be\n\nlooking for ways to elevate the constraint, which means I need to do\n\nwhatever is required to get more cycles from Brent. That’s exactly what the\n\nmonitoring project does!”\n\nI say with some disbelief that I didn’t see this before, “The monitoring\n\nproject is probably the most important improvement project we have—we\n\nneed to start this project right away.”\n\n“Precisely,” Erik says. “Properly elevating preventive work is at the\n\nheart of programs like Total Productive Maintenance, which has been\n\nembraced by the Lean Community. TPM insists that we do whatever it takes\n\nto assure machine availability by elevating maintenance. As one of my\n\nsenseis would say, ‘Improving daily work is even more important than\n\ndoing daily work.’ The Third Way is all about ensuring that we’re\n\ncontinually putting tension into the system, so that we’re continually\n\nreinforcing habits and improving something. Resilience engineering tells us\n\nthat we should routinely inject faults into the system, doing them frequently,\n\nto make them less painful.\n\n“Mike Rother says that it almost doesn’t matter what you improve, as\n\nlong as you’re improving something. Why? Because if you are not\n\nimproving, entropy guarantees that you are actually getting worse, which\n\nensures that there is no path to zero errors, zero work-related accidents, and\n\nzero loss.”\n\nSuddenly, it’s so obvious and evident. I feel like I need to call Patty right\n\naway to tell her to start the monitoring project immediately.\n\nErik continues, “Rother calls this the Improvement Kata,” he continues.\n\n“He used the word kata, because he understood that repetition creates\n\nhabits, and habits are what enable mastery. Whether you’re talking about\n\nsports training, learning a musical instrument, or training in the Special\n\nForces, nothing is more to mastery than practice and drills. Studies have\n\nshown that practicing five minutes daily is better than practicing once a\n\nweek for three hours. And if you want to create a genuine culture of\n\nimprovement, you must create those habits.”\n\nTurning back to the plant floor, he continues, “Before we leave, turn\n\nyour attention from the work centers to all the space between the work\n\ncenters. Just as important as throttling the release of work is managing the\n\nhandoffs. The wait time for a given resource is the percentage that resource\n\nis busy, divided by the percentage that resource is idle. So, if a resource is\n\nfifty percent utilized, the wait time is 50/50, or 1 unit. If the resource is\n\nninety percent utilized, the wait time is 90/10, or nine times longer. And if\n\nthe resource is ninety-nine percent utilized?”\n\nAlthough I’m not quite understanding the relevance, I do the math in my\n\nhead: 99/1. I say, “Ninety-nine.”\n\n“Correct,” he says. “When a resource is ninety-nine percent utilized, you\n\nhave to wait ninety-nine times as long as if that resource is fifty percent\n\nutilized.”\n\nHe gestures expansively, “A critical part of the Second Way is making\n\nwait times visible, so you know when your work spends days sitting in\n\nsomeone’s queue—or worse, when work has to go backward, because it\n\ndoesn’t have all the parts or requires rework.\n\n“Remember that our goal is to maximize flow. Here at MRP-8, we had a\n\nsituation many years ago where certain components were never showing up\n\nat final assembly on time. Was it because we didn’t have enough resources\n\nor because certain tasks were taking too long?\n\n“No! When we actually followed the parts around on the plant floor, we\n\nfound that for the majority of time, the parts were just sitting in queues. In\n\nother words, the ‘touch time’ was a tiny fraction of ‘total process time.’ Our\n\nexpediters had to search through mountains of work to find the parts, and\n\npush them through the work center,” he says incredulously.\n\n“That’s happening at your plant, too, so watch for it,” he says.\n\nI nod and say, “Erik, I’m still stuck on releasing the monitoring project.\n\nPeople always insist that their special project is urgent, and needs to be\n\nworked at the expense of everything else. Where do all the urgent audit and\n\nsecurity remediation projects that John is screaming for fit in?”\n\nErik looks intently at my face and finally says, “Have you heard a\n\ndamned word I’ve been saying in the last two weeks?”\n\nHe looks at his watch and says, “Gotta go.”\n\nStartled, I watch him as he walks quickly to the catwalk exit. I have to\n\nrun to catch him. He’s a big guy, probably a little over fifty years old.\n\nDespite the extra pounds he’s carrying, he moves fast.\n\nWhen I catch up to him, I say, “Wait. Are you saying that audit issues\n\naren’t important enough to fix?”\n\n“I never said that,” he says, stopping in his tracks and turning to face\n\nme. “You screw up something that jeopardizes the business’ ability to\n\nmaintain compliance with relevant laws and regulations? You better fix it—\n\nor you should be fired.”\n\nHe turns around and resumes his pace, saying over his shoulder, “Tell\n\nme. All those projects that Jimmy your CISO is pushing. Do they increase the\n\nflow of project work through the IT organization?”\n\n“No,” I quickly answer, rushing to catch up again.\n\n“Do they increase operational stability or decrease the time required to\n\ndetect and recover from outages or security breaches?”\n\nI think a bit longer. “Probably not. A lot of it is just more busywork, and\n\nin most cases, the work they’re asking for is risky and actually could cause\n\noutages.”\n\n“Do these projects increase Brent’s capacity?”\n\nI laugh humorlessly. “No, the opposite. The audit issues alone could tie\n\nup Brent for the next year.”\n\n“And what would doing all of Jimmy’s projects do to WIP levels?” he\n\nasks, opening the door that takes us back into the stairwell.\n\nExasperated, I say as we descend the two sets of stairs, “It would go\n\nthrough the roof. Again.”\n\nWhen we reach the bottom, Erik suddenly stops and asks, “Okay. These\n\n‘security’ projects decrease your project throughput, which is the constraint\n\nfor the entire business. And swamp the most constrained resource in your\n\norganization. And they don’t do squat for scalability, availability,\n\nsurvivability, sustainability, security, supportability, or the defensibility of\n\nthe organization.”\n\nHe asks deadpan, “So, genius: Do Jimmy’s projects sound like a good\n\nuse of time to you?”\n\nAs I start to answer, he just opens the exit door and walks through it.\n\nApparently, it was a rhetorical question.\n\nChapter 21 • Friday, September 26\n\nDespite breaking every speed limit on the way, I’m twenty minutes late to\n\nthe audit meeting in Building 2. When I step into the conference room, I’m\n\nstunned at how packed it is.\n\nIt’s immediately obvious that this is a high-stakes meeting, fraught with\n\npolitical nuance. Dick and our corporate counsel are at the head of the table.\n\nOpposite them are the external auditors who are legally liable for\n\nfinding financial reporting errors and fraud, and yet they still want to keep\n\nus as clients.\n\nDick and his team will try to show that everything the auditors have\n\nfound is all a genuine misunderstanding. Their goal is to appear earnest, but\n\nindignant that their precious time is being wasted.\n\nIt’s all political theater but high-stakes political theater that is definitely\n\nabove my pay grade.\n\nAnn and Nancy are also here along with Wes and some other folks who\n\nlook familiar.\n\nThen I see John and do a double take.\n\nMy God, he looks terrible—like someone on his third day of quitting an\n\naddiction. He looks as if he thinks that the entire room will turn on him at a\n\nmoment’s notice and tear him to shreds, which may not be that far from the\n\ntruth.\n\nSitting next to John is Erik, who is the picture of composure.\n\nHow did he get here so quickly? And where did he change into those\n\nkhaki pants and denim shirt? In the car? While he was walking?",

      "content": "As I sit down next to Wes, he leans toward me. He gestures at a stapled\n\nset of papers and whispers, “The agenda for this meeting is to go through\n\nthese two material weaknesses and the sixteen significant deficiencies.\n\nThere’s John, looking like he’s in front of the firing squad, waiting for the\n\nbullet.”\n\nI see the sweat stains under John’s arms, and think to myself, Good\n\ngrief, John. Pull yourself together. I’m the operational manager where all\n\nthose IT deficiencies reside, so I’m actually the one on the firing line, not\n\nyou.\n\nBut unlike John, I’ve had the benefit of having Erik’s constant\n\nreassurances that everything will work out.\n\nThen again, Erik doesn’t have his ass on the line and for a brief moment,\n\nI wonder whether I should be as nervous as John.\n\nFive hours later, the conference table is covered with marked-up papers and\n\nempty cups of coffee, the room smelling stale and rank from all the tension\n\nand heated arguments.\n\nI look up at the sound of the audit partner closing his briefcase.\n\nHe says to Dick, “Given this new data, it does appear that for the two\n\npotential material weaknesses, the IT controls may indeed be out of scope\n\nand thus can be resolved very quickly. Thank you in advance for making\n\nyourselves available to get us the documentation we need to close out these\n\nissues as expeditiously as possible.\n\n“We will take all this under advisement and send you something in the\n\nnext day or two,” he continues. “Most likely, we’ll want to schedule further\n\ntesting of these newly documented downstream controls to make sure they\n\nwere in place and operating—to support the financial statement assertions\n\nyou’re making.”\n\nAs he stands up, I stare in disbelief at the audit partner. We really\n\ndodged the bullet. Looking around the table, the Parts Unlimited team looks\n\nequally surprised.\n\nOne exception is Erik, who just nods approvingly, obviously irritated\n\nthat it took so long to finally have the auditors on the run.\n\nThe other exception is John. He looks extremely distraught, sitting with\n\nhis shoulders slumped over that I’m suddenly concerned about his well-\n\nbeing.\n\nI’m about to get up to check on John when the audit partner shakes\n\nDick’s hand and, to my surprise, Erik gets up to give him a hug.\n\n“Erik, it’s been a long time since GAIT and Orlando,” the audit partner\n\nsays warmly. “I was sure our paths would cross again, but I never would\n\nhave guessed it would be at a client engagement! What have you been up to\n\nlately?”\n\nErik laughs and says, “Mostly, happily sailing on my boat. A friend\n\nasked me to join the Parts Unlimited board, partly due to their external\n\nauditors making trouble with a bunch of young, bottom-up auditors who\n\nstrayed off the reservation. I should have known you’d be involved.”\n\nThe audit partner looks genuinely embarrassed, and they huddle\n\ntogether, whispering.\n\nFor the past five hours, John, Wes, and I sat on the sidelines while the\n\nbusiness managers walked the auditors through a precise discussion about\n\nhow the IT control issues simply couldn’t lead to an undetected financial\n\nreporting error. They pulled out something called the “GAIT Principles”\n\ndocument and cited some of the enclosed flowcharts.\n\nLike watching a tennis match, the ball went back and forth between our\n\nteam and the auditors, using words like “linkage,” “significance,” and\n\n“controls reliance.” On occasion, Dick would trot in a bunch of experts\n\nfrom the relevant business areas to show that even if someone malicious\n\nmanaged to cause a failure in the IT control, the fraud would still be caught\n\nby another control somewhere downstream.\n\nManagers from Materials Management, Order Entry, Treasury, and\n\nHuman Resources showed that even if the application, database, operating\n\nsystem, and firewall were riddled with security holes and thoroughly\n\ncompromised, the fraudulent transaction would still be caught by some\n\ndaily or weekly inventory reconciliation report.\n\nOver and over again, they went through scenarios that assumed all the IT\n\ninfrastructure was made of Swiss cheese, where any disgruntled or\n\nwrongdoing employee or external, malicious hacker could log in and\n\ncommit fraud with impunity.\n\nBut they would still detect any material error in the financial statements.\n\nOnce, Dick pointed out that an entire department of twenty people is\n\nresponsible for spotting erroneous, let alone fraudulent, orders. They, and\n\nnot an IT control, served as the business safety net.\n\nEach time, the auditors, often reluctantly, agreed that controls reliance\n\nwas placed on finance doing reconciliations. And not on the IT systems or\n\nthe IT controls within.\n\nThis was news to me. But I certainly wasn’t going to disagree with\n\nthem. In fact, if shutting up and staying silent would allow Parts Unlimited\n\nto escape all the audit findings, I’d be happy to drool and pretend to be\n\nunable to read.\n\n“You have a minute to talk?” I hear John say beside me in a scratchy\n\nvoice.\n\nHe’s still slumped over, his head in his hands.\n\n“Sure,” I say, looking around at the nearly empty room. It’s just John\n\nand me at the large conference table, while Erik continues his whispered\n\npowwow with the audit partner in the far corner.\n\nJohn looks awful. If his shirt were just a little more wrinkled, and maybe\n\nhad a stain or two in front, he could almost pass as a homeless person.\n\n“John, are you coming down with something? You don’t look so hot,” I\n\nsay.\n\nHis expression turns ugly, “Do you know how much political capital\n\nI’ve spent over the last two years, trying to get everyone to do the right\n\nthing? This goddamned organization has been kicking the information\n\nsecurity can down the road for a decade. I put absolutely everything on the\n\nline. I told them the world would end if they didn’t go beyond lip-service,\n\nand at least try to fix some of these systemic IT security issues… I mean, we\n\nneed to at least pretend to care.”\n\nFrom the other side of the room, I see Erik turn to look at us. The audit\n\npartner doesn’t seem to have heard John. Nevertheless, Erik puts his arm\n\naround him and collegially moves the conversation into the hallway, closing\n\nthe door loudly behind him.\n\nOblivious, John continues, “You know, there are times when I think I’m\n\nthe only person in this entire company that actually cares about the security\n\nof our systems and data. Do you know how it feels to have the entire Dev\n\norganization hiding their activities from me, and having to beg people to tell\n\nme where they’re meeting? What is this, elementary school? I’m only trying\n\nto help them do their jobs!”\n\nWhen I don’t say anything, he just sneers at me. “Don’t look at me like\n\nthat. I know you look down at me, Bill.”\n\nI look at him with genuine surprise.\n\n“I know you never read my e-mails. I have to call you to even get you to\n\nopen them up—I know, because I get the read receipts while we’re on the\n\nphone, you asshole.”\n\nAh.\n\nBut I’ve read many of his e-mails without him having to call me first.\n\nHowever, before I can respond, he barrels forward, “You all look down on\n\nme. You know, I used to manage servers, just like you do. But I found my\n\ncalling doing information security. I wanted to help catch bad guys. I\n\nwanted to help organizations protect themselves from people who were out\n\nto get them. It came out of a sense of duty and a desire to make the world a\n\nbetter place.\n\n“But ever since I’ve been here, all I do is fight the corporate\n\nbureaucracy and the business, even though I’m trying to protect them from\n\nthemselves.” Laughing harshly he says, “The auditors were supposed to put\n\nthe screws on us. They were supposed to punish us sinners for our ungodly\n\nways. And you know what? All afternoon, we just watched the audit partner\n\npamper us with kid gloves. What is the point of even having an information\n\nsecurity program at all? Even the auditors don’t care! Everything just got\n\nbrushed under the rug for the cost of a golf game.”\n\nJohn is almost shouting, “Our auditors should be put on trial for\n\nincompetence! All those findings they dismissed were basic hygiene issues!\n\nWe live in a goddamned cesspool of risk. I’m amazed this place doesn’t just\n\ncollapse under its own weight from lack of caring. I’ve waited for years for\n\neverything to come crashing down upon us.”\n\nHe pauses, whispering, “And yet, here we still are…”\n\nJust then, Erik enters the room again, slamming the door behind him. He\n\ngrabs the seat closest to the door and looks sternly at John.\n\n“You know what your problem is, Jimmy?” Erik says, pointing his\n\nfinger at him. “You are like the political commissar who walks onto the\n\nplant floor, proudly flashing your badge at all the line workers, sadistically\n\npoking your nose in everybody’s business and intimidating them into doing\n\nyour bidding, just to increase your own puny sense of self-worth. Half the\n\ntime, you break more than you fix. Worse, you screw up the work schedules\n\nof everyone who’s actually doing important work.”\n\nThis is going way overboard.\n\nJohn sputters, “Who do you think you are? I’m trying to keep this\n\norganization secure and keep the auditors away! I’m—”\n\n“Why, thank you for nothing, Mr. CISO,” Erik says, interrupting him. “As\n\nyou just observed, the organization can keep the auditors away without you\n\nhaving to do anything at all. You are like the plumber who doesn’t even\n\nrealize that you’re servicing an airplane, let alone the route you’re flying, or\n\nthe business condition of the airline.”\n\nBy now, John is white as a sheet, his jaw hanging open.\n\nI’m about to intervene on his behalf, when Erik stands up and shouts to\n\nJohn, “I don’t have anything further to say to you until you prove to me that\n\nyou understand what just happened in this room. The business managed to\n\ndodge the SOX-404 audit bullet, without any help from your team. Until you\n\nfigure out how and why, you don’t have any business interfering with the\n\ndaily operations of this organization. This should be your guiding principle:\n\nyou win when you protect the organization without putting meaningless\n\nwork into the IT system. And you win even more when you can take\n\nmeaningless work out of the IT system.”\n\nHe then turns to me and says, “Bill, you just may be right. You guys\n\naround here sure seem to have completely screwed up information\n\nsecurity.”\n\nI never said any such thing. I turn to look at John, intending to convey\n\nthat I have no idea what he’s talking about, but John doesn’t notice me. He’s\n\nstaring at Erik with an expression of intense hatred on his face.\n\nErik says to me, pointing his thumb at John, “This guy is like the QA\n\nmanager who has his group writing millions of new tests for a product we\n\ndon’t even ship anymore and then files millions of bug reports for features\n\nthat no longer exist. Obviously, he is making what you and I would call a\n\n‘scoping error.’”\n\nJohn is shaking with outrage. He says, “How dare you! As a potential\n\nboard director, I can’t believe you’re telling us to put our customer data and\n\nfinancial statements at risk!”\n\nErik looks calmly back at John. “You really don’t get it, do you? The\n\nbiggest risk to Parts Unlimited is going out of business. And you seem hell-\n\nbent on making it go out of business even faster, with all your ill-conceived,\n\nirrelevant technical minutia. No wonder you’ve been marginalized!\n\nEveryone else is at least trying to help the business survive. If this were an\n\nepisode of Survivor, you’d have been voted off a long time ago!”\n\nBy now, Erik is standing over John. “Jimmy, Parts Unlimited has at least\n\nfour of my family’s credit card numbers in your systems. I need you to\n\nprotect that data. But you’ll never adequately protect it when the work\n\nproduct is already in production. You need to protect it in the processes that\n\ncreate the work product.”\n\nPutting his hands in his pockets, he says more softly, “You want a clue?\n\nGo to MRP-8 plant and find the plant safety officer. Go talk to her, find out\n\nwhat she’s trying to accomplish and how she does it.”\n\nErik’s expression brightens slightly and he adds, “And please convey\n\nmy regards to her. I’ll be ready to talk with you again when Dick says he\n\nactually wants you around.”\n\nWith that, he walks out the door.\n\nJohn looks at me, “What the hell?”\n\nPulling myself out of my chair, I say, “Don’t let it get to you. He says\n\nsimilar things to me. I’m exhausted and I’m going home. I suggest you do\n\nthe same.”\n\nJohn stands up wordlessly. With the calm expression remaining on his\n\nface, he pushes the three-ring binder off the table. It hits the ground with a\n\nlarge thump, all the contents scattering everywhere. Hundreds of pages are\n\nnow strewn across the floor.\n\nHe looks at me with a humorless smile and says, “I will. Go home, that\n\nis. I don’t know if I’ll be in tomorrow—or ever. What’s the point, really?”\n\nHe then walks out of the room.\n\nI stare at John’s binder, not quite believing he discarded it so carelessly.\n\nHe’s been carrying it around for over two years. In front of where he was\n\nsitting is a single piece of paper, almost blank with a few lines scribbled on\n\nit. Wondering if it’s a suicide note or a resignation letter, I sneak a quick\n\npeek at what appears to be a poem.\n\nA haiku?\n\nHere I sit, hands tied\n\nRoom angry, I could save them\n\nIf only they knew\n\nChapter 22 • Monday, September 29\n\nThe Monday following the audit meeting, John disappeared. There is a\n\nbetting pool in the NOC speculating whether he suffered a nervous\n\nbreakdown, was fired, is just hiding, or worse.\n\nI see Wes and some of his engineers, all laughing loudly, presumably at\n\nJohn’s expense.\n\nI clear my throat to get Wes’ attention. When he walks over, I turn\n\naround so that my back is to the NOC, shielding everyone from hearing what\n\nI’m telling Wes. “Do me a favor? Don’t fan the rumor mill about John.\n\nRemember what Steve was trying to impress upon us at the off-site? We\n\nneed to build a mutually respectful and trusted working relationship with\n\nhim.”\n\nWes’ smile disappears and after a moment, he finally says, “Yeah, I\n\nknow. I’m just kidding, okay?”\n\n“Good,” I say, nodding. “Okay, enough of that. Follow me. I need to talk\n\nto you and Patty about the monitoring project.” We go to her office, where\n\nshe’s sitting at her desk, typing away in a project management application,\n\nfull of Gantt charts.\n\n“Got a half hour?” I ask her.\n\nWhen she nods, we gather around her conference table. I say, “I talked\n\nwith Erik on Friday before the audit meeting. Here’s what I learned.”\n\nI tell them how Erik validated that we can release the monitoring project\n\nand how important this project is to further elevate Brent. I then try to",

Bill of resources and routings?” Wes says, suddenly\n\nlooking very dubious. “Bill, I don’t need to remind you that we’re not\n\nrunning a factory here. This is IT work. We use our brains to get things\n\ndone, not our hands. I know Erik has said a couple of smart things here and\n\nthere, but come on… This sounds like some sort of consultant parlor trick.”\n\n“Look, I’m having trouble getting my head around this, too,” I say. “But\n\ncan you really say that the conclusions we’re making based on his thinking\n\nare wrong? Do you think it’s unsafe to release the monitoring project?”\n\nPatty wrinkles her forehead. “We know that IT work can be projects or\n\nchanges. And in many of the projects, there are many tasks or subprojects\n\nthat show up over and over again. Like setting up a server. It’s recurring\n\nwork. I guess you could call that a subassembly.”\n\nShe stands up, walks to the whiteboard, and draws some boxes. “Let’s\n\nuse the example of configuring a server. It involves procurement, installing\n\nthe OS and applications on it according to some specification, and then\n\ngetting it racked and stacked. Then we validate that it’s been built correctly.\n\nEach of these steps are typically done by different people. Maybe each step\n\nis like a work center, each with its own machines, methods, men, and\n\nmeasures.”\n\nWith less certainty, she continues, “But I’m not sure if I know what the\n\nmachine would be.”\n\nI smile as Patty scrawls on the board. She’s making some leaps that I\n\nhaven’t been able to make. I don’t know where she’ll end up, but I think\n\nshe’s on the right track.\n\n“Maybe the machine,” I speculate, “is the tools necessary to do the\n\nwork? The virtualization management consoles, terminal sessions, and\n\nmaybe the virtual disk space that we attach to it?”\n\nPatty shakes her head. “Maybe. The consoles and terminals sound like\n\nthey could be the machine. And I think disk space, the applications, license\n\nkeys, and so forth are all actually inputs or the raw materials needed to\n\ncreate the outputs.”\n\nShe stares at the whiteboard. At last, she says, “I suspect that until we do\n\na couple of these, we’ll just be stumbling in the dark. I’m starting to think\n\nthat this whole work center notion actually describes IT work pretty well.\n\nFor this server setup example, we know that it’s a work center that gets hit\n\nby almost every business and IT project. If we nail this down, we’ll actually\n\nbe able to provide better estimates to Kirsten and all her project managers.”\n\n“Give me a break, guys,” Wes says. “First, our work is not repetitive.\n\nSecond, it requires a lot of knowledge, unlike the people who just assemble\n\nparts or tighten screws. We hire very smart people with experience. Trust\n\nme. We can’t standardize our work like manufacturing does.”\n\nI consider Wes’ point. “Last week, I think I would have agreed with you,\n\nWes. But I watched one of the final assembly work centers on the\n\nmanufacturing floor for fifteen minutes last week. I was overwhelmed with\n\neverything that was going on. Frankly, I could barely keep up with it.\n\nDespite trying to make everything repetitive and repeatable, they still had to\n\ndo an incredible amount of improvisation and problem solving just to hit\n\ntheir daily production goals. They’re doing a whole lot more than tightening\n\nscrews. They’re performing heroics every day, using every bit of experience\n\nand smarts they have.”\n\nI say adamantly, “They really earned my respect. If it weren’t for them,\n\nwe all wouldn’t even have jobs. I think we have a lot to learn from plant\n\nfloor management.”\n\nI pause. “Let’s start the monitoring project as soon as we can. The\n\nsooner we start, the sooner we’ll get the benefits. We need to protect each of\n\nour resources as if they were all Brents, so let’s get this done.”\n\n“There’s one more thing,” Patty says. “I keep thinking about the lanes of\n\nwork we’re trying to create. I’d like to test some of these concepts with the\n\nincoming service requests, like account add/change/deletes, password\n\nresets, and—you know—laptop replacements.”\n\nShe looks uncomfortably at my giant laptop, which is in even worse\n\nshape than when I first got it three weeks ago. I’ve had to put even more\n\nduct tape on it to keep it from falling apart, due to some further damage I\n\ncaused when I used my car keys to pry it open. And now, half the paint on\n\nthe screen lid has flaked off.\n\n“Oh, for chrissakes,” Wes groans, looking at it, genuinely embarrassed.\n\n“I can’t believe we haven’t gotten you a replacement. We don’t suck that\n\nmuch. Patty, I’ll find someone for you to dedicate to the laptop and desktop\n\nbacklog.”\n\n“Fantastic,” Patty replies. “I have a little experiment in mind that I’d\n\nlike to try out.”\n\nNot wanting to get in the way, I say, “Make it so.”\n\nWhen I get to the office on the following Monday, Patty is waiting for me.\n\n“You have a second?” she asks, obviously eager to show me something.\n\nNext thing I know, I’m standing in Patty’s Change Coordination Room.\n\nI immediately spot on the back wall a new board. On it: index cards\n\narranged in four rows.\n\nThe rows are labeled “Move worker office,” “Add/change/delete\n\naccount,” “Provision new desktop/laptop,” and “Reset password.”\n\nEach row has been divided up into three columns, labeled “Ready,”\n\n“Doing,” and “Done.”\n\nInteresting. This looks vaguely familiar. “What is this? Another change\n\nboard?”\n\nPatty breaks out into a grin and says, “It’s a kanban board. After our last\n\nmeeting, I went to MRP-8 myself. I was so curious about this work center\n\nnotion that I had to see it in action. I managed to find one of the supervisors\n\nthat I’ve worked with before, and he spent an hour with me showing how\n\nthey managed the flow of work.”\n\nPatty explains that a kanban board, among many other things, is one of\n\nthe primary ways our manufacturing plants schedule and pull work through\n\nthe system. It makes demand and WIP visible, and is used to signal upstream\n\nand downstream stations.\n\n“I’m experimenting with putting kanbans around our key resources. Any\n\nactivities they work on must go through the kanban. Not by e-mail, instant\n\nmessage, telephone, or whatever.\n\n“If it’s not on the kanban board, it won’t get done,” she says. “And more\n\nimportantly, if it is on the kanban board, it will get done quickly. You’d be\n\namazed at how fast work is getting completed, because we’re limiting the\n\nwork in process. Based on our experiments so far, I think we’re going to be\n\nable to predict lead times for work and get faster throughput than ever.”\n\nThat Patty is now sounding a bit like Erik is both unsettling and\n\nexciting.\n\n“What I’ve done,” she continues, “is take some of our most frequent\n\nservice requests, documented exactly what the steps are and what resources\n\ncan execute them, and timed how long each operation takes. Here’s the\n\nresult.”\n\nShe hands me a piece of paper proudly.\n\nIt’s titled, “Laptop replacement queue.” On it is a list of everyone who’s\n\nrequested either a new or replacement laptop or desktop along with when\n\nthey submitted the request and the projected date they’ll receive it. They’re\n\nsorted by the oldest requests first.\n\nI’m apparently fourteenth in line, with my laptop projected to arrive four\n\ndays from now.\n\n“You actually believe this schedule?” I say, trying to be skeptical.\n\nHowever, it really would be fantastic if we could actually publish this to\n\neveryone, and be able to hit those dates.\n\n“We worked on this all weekend long,” she replies. “Based on the trials\n\nwe’ve done since Friday, we’re pretty confident that we understand the time\n\nrequired go from start to finish. We’ve even figured out how to save a\n\nbunch of steps by changing where we’re doing disk mirroring. Between you\n\nand me, based on the time savings we’re generating, I think that we’ll beat\n\nthese dates.”\n\nShe shakes her head. “You know, I did a quick poll of people we’ve\n\nissued laptops to. It usually takes fifteen turns to finally get them configured\n\ncorrectly. I’m tracking that now, and trying to drive this down to three.\n\nWe’re putting in checklists everywhere, especially when we do handoffs\n\nwithin the team. It’s really making a difference. Error rates are way down.”\n\nI smile and say, “This is important. Getting executives and workers the\n\ntools they need to do their jobs is one of our primary responsibilities. I’m\n\nnot saying I don’t believe you, but let’s keep these time estimates to\n\nourselves for now. If you can generate a week’s track record of hitting the\n\ndates, then let’s start publishing this to all the requesters and their managers,\n\nokay?”\n\nPatty smiles in return. “I was thinking the same thing. Imagine what this\n\nwill do to user satisfaction if we could tell them when they make the request\n\nhow long the queue is, tell them to the day when they’ll get it, and actually\n\nhit the date, because we’re not letting our workers multitask or get\n\ninterrupted!\n\n“My plant supervisor friend also told me about the Improvement Kata\n\nthey’ve adopted. Believe it or not, Erik helped them institute it many years\n\nago. They have continual two-week improvement cycles, each requiring\n\nthem to implement one small Plan-Do-Check-Act project to keep them\n\nmarching toward the goal. You don’t mind that I’ve taken the liberty of\n\nadopting this practice in our group to keep us moving toward our own\n\ngoals, right?”\n\nErik had mentioned this kata term and the continual two-week\n\nimprovement cycles before. Once again, Patty is at least one step ahead of\n\nme.\n\n“This is great work, Patty. Really, really well done.”\n\n“Thanks,” she modestly responds, but she’s grinning from ear to ear.\n\n“I’m really excited by what I’m learning. For the first time, I’m seeing how\n\nwe should be managing our work, and even for these simpler service desk\n\ntasks, I know it’s going to make a big difference.”\n\nShe points at the change board at the front of the room. “What I’m really\n\nlooking forward to is to start using these techniques for more complex\n\nwork. Once we figure out what our most frequently recurring tasks are, we\n\nneed to create work centers and lanes of work, just like I did for my service\n\nrequests. Maybe we can even get rid of some of this scheduling, and create\n\nkanban boards instead. Our engineers could then take any card from the\n\nReady column, move them to Doing, until they’re Done!”\n\nUnfortunately, I can’t visualize it. “Keep going. Just make sure you’re\n\nworking with Wes on this, and that he’s onboard, okay?”\n\n“Already on it,” she replies quickly. “In fact, I have a meeting with him\n\nlater today to discuss putting a kanban around Brent, to further isolate him\n\nfrom our daily crises. I want to formalize how Brent gets work and increase\n\nour ability to standardize what he’s working on. It’ll give us a way to figure\n\nout where all of Brent’s work comes from, both on the upstream and\n\ndownstream sides. And of course, it will give us one more line of defense\n\nfrom people doing drive-bys on Brent.”\n\nI give her a thumbs-up, and get ready to leave. “Wait, the change board\n\nlooks different. Why are the cards different colors?”\n\nShe looks at the board and says, “Oh, I haven’t told you? We’re color-\n\ncoding the cards to help us get ready for when we lift the project freeze.\n\nWe’ve got to have some way to make sure we’re working on the most\n\nimportant things. So, the purple cards are the changes supporting one of the\n\ntop five business projects, otherwise, they’re yellow. The green cards are for\n\ninternal IT improvement projects, and we’re experimenting with allocating\n\ntwenty percent of our cycles just for those, as Erik recommended we do. At\n\na glance, we can confirm that there’s the right balance of purple and green\n\ncards in work.”\n\nShe continues, “The pink sticky notes indicate the cards that are blocked\n\nsomehow, which we’re therefore reviewing twice a day. We’re also putting\n\nall these cards back into our change tracking tool, so we’re putting the\n\nchange IDs on each of the cards, too. It’s a bit tedious, but at least now part\n\nof the tracking is automated.”\n\n“Wow, that’s…incredible,” I say, with genuine awe.\n\nLater that day, I’m sitting down at another conference table with Wes and\n\nPatty to figure out how we’re going to turn the project faucet back on\n\nslowly enough so we can drink but don’t end up drowning.\n\n“As Erik pointed out, we actually have two project queues that we need\n\nto sequence: business and internal projects,” Patty says, pointing to the thin\n\nstapled set of papers in front of us. “Let’s do the business projects first,\n\nbecause they’re easier. We have the top five most important projects\n\nidentified, as ranked by all the project sponsors. Four of these will require\n\nsome work from Brent. When the freeze lifts, we propose that we only\n\nrelease these five projects.”\n\n“That was easy,” Wes laughs. “I can’t believe how much arguing,\n\nposturing, horse-trading, and backstabbing went on to get the top five\n\nprojects identified. It was worse than Chicago politics!”\n\nHe’s right. But in the end, we got our prioritized list.\n\n“Now to the hard part. We’re still struggling on how to prioritize our\n\nown seventy-three internal projects,” she says, her expression turning glum.\n\n“There’s still way too many. We’ve spent weeks with all the team leads\n\ntrying to establish some sort of relative importance level, but that’s all\n\nwe’ve done. Argue.”\n\nShe flips to the second page. “The projects seem to fall into the\n\nfollowing categories: replacing fragile infrastructure, vendor upgrades, or\n\nsupporting some internal business requirement. The rest are a hodgepodge\n\nof audit and security work, data center upgrade work, and so forth.”\n\nI look at the second list, scratching my head. Patty is right. How does\n\none objectively decide whether “consolidating and upgrading e-mail server”\n\nis more or less important than “upgrading thirty-five instances of SQL\n\ndatabases”?\n\nI run my fingers down the page, trying to see if anything jumps out at\n\nme. It’s the same list I saw during my first week on the job, and they still all\n\nlook important.\n\nRealizing that Wes and Patty have spent almost a week with this list, I\n\ntry to elevate my thinking. There’s got to be some simple way to prioritize\n\nthis list that doesn’t look like moving a bunch of boxes around.\n\nSuddenly, I remember how Erik described the importance of preventive\n\nwork, such as the monitoring project. I say, “I don’t care how important\n\neveryone thinks their project is. We need to know whether it increases our\n\ncapacity at our constraint, which is still Brent. Unless the project reduces\n\nhis workload or enables someone else to take it over, maybe we shouldn’t\n\neven be doing it. On the other hand, if a project doesn’t even require Brent,\n\nthere’s no reason we shouldn’t just do it.”\n\nI say assertively, “Give me three lists. One that requires Brent work, one\n\nthat increases Brent’s throughput, and the last one is everything else.\n\nIdentify the top projects on each list. Don’t spend too much time ordering\n\nthem—I don’t want us spending days arguing. The most important list is the\n\nsecond one. We need to keep Brent’s capacity up by reducing the amount of\n\nunplanned work that hits him.”\n\n“That sounds familiar,” Patty says. She digs up the list of fragile\n\nservices that we created for the change management process. “We should\n\nmake sure we have a project to replace or stabilize each one of these. And\n\nmaybe we suspend indefinitely any infrastructure refresh project for\n\nanything that’s not fragile.”\n\n“Now hang on a minute,” Wes says. “Bill, you said it yourself.\n\nPreventive work is important, but it always gets deferred. We’ve been trying\n\nto do some of these projects for years! This is our chance to get caught up.”\n\nPatty says quickly, “Didn’t you hear what Erik told Bill? Improving\n\nsomething anywhere not at the constraint is an illusion. You know, no\n\noffense, but you sort of sound like John right now.”\n\nDespite my best attempts, I still laugh.\n\nWes turns red for a moment, and then laughs loudly. “Ouch. Okay, you\n\ngot me. But I’m just trying to do the right thing.”\n\n“Doh!” he says, interrupting himself. “I did it again.”\n\nWe all laugh. It makes me wonder how John is doing. To the best of my\n\nknowledge, no one has seen him all day.\n\nWhile Wes and Patty are scribbling notes, I scan the list of internal\n\nprojects again. “Hey, why is there a project for upgrading the BART database\n\neven though it’s going to be decommissioned next year?”\n\nPatty peers down at her list and then looks embarrassed. “Oh, jeez. I\n\ndidn’t see that because we never reconciled the business and IT projects\n\nwith each other. We’re going to have to scrub the lists one more time to find\n\ndependencies like this. I’m sure there are others.”\n\nPatty thinks for a moment, “It’s strange. Even though we have so much\n\ndata on projects, changes, and tickets, we’ve never organized and linked\n\nthem all together this way before.\n\n“Here’s another thing we can learn from manufacturing, I think,” she\n\ncontinues. “We’re doing what Manufacturing Production Control\n\nDepartments do. They’re the people that schedule and oversee all of\n\nproduction to ensure they can meet customer demand. When they accept an\n\norder, they confirm there’s enough capacity and necessary inputs at each\n\nrequired work center, expediting work when necessary. They work with the\n\nsales manager and plant manager to build a production schedule so they can\n\ndeliver on all their commitments.”\n\nAgain, Patty is way ahead of me. This answers one of the first questions\n\nthat Erik tasked me with before I quit. I make a note for us to visit MRP-8 to\n\nsee their production control processes.\n\nI get a creeping suspicion that “managing the IT Operations production\n\nschedule” should be somewhere in my job description.\n\nTwo days later, I’m surprised to see a new laptop in my office. My old\n\nlaptop has been disconnected and moved to the side.\n\nI look at my clipboard, flipping back to the laptop/desktop replacement\n\nschedule that Patty gave me earlier this week.\n\nHoly crap.\n\nPatty had promised laptop delivery for Friday, and I’m receiving it two\n\ndays early.\n\nI log on to make sure it’s been configured properly. All the applications\n\nseem to be there, all my data have been transferred, e-mail is working, the\n\nnetwork drives show up like before, and I can install new applications.\n\nI feel tears of gratitude welling up when I see how fast my new laptop\n\nis. Grabbing Patty’s schedule, I go next door. “I love the new laptop. Two\n\ndays ahead of schedule, even. Everyone ahead of me got their systems, too,\n\nright?”\n\nPatty grins. “Yep. Every single one of them. A couple of the early ones\n\nwe delivered had a few configuration errors or were missing something.\n\nWe’ve corrected it in the work instructions, and we seem to be batting one\n\nhundred percent delivering correct systems for the past two days.”\n\n“Great work, Patty!” I say, excitedly. “Go ahead and start publishing the\n\nschedule. I want to start showing this off!”\n\nChapter 23 • Tuesday, October 7\n\nAs I drive into work the following Tuesday morning, I get an urgent phone\n\ncall from Kirsten. Apparently, Brent is now almost a week late delivering\n\non another Phoenix task—allegedly something that Brent said would only\n\ntake an hour to do. Once again, the entire Phoenix testing schedule is in\n\njeopardy.\n\nOn top of that, several other of my group’s critical tasks are late, putting\n\neven more pressure on the deadline. This is genuinely dispiriting to hear. I\n\nthought all our recent breakthroughs would solve these due-date\n\nperformance issues.\n\nHow can we unfreeze more work if we can’t even keep up now?\n\nI leave Patty a voicemail. To my surprise, it takes her three hours to call\n\nme back. She tells me that something is going terribly wrong with our\n\nscheduling estimates and that we need to meet right away.\n\nOnce again, I’m in a conference room, with Patty at the whiteboard, and\n\nWes scrutinizing the printouts she’s taped up.\n\n“Here’s what I’ve learned so far,” Patty says, pointing at one of the\n\nsheets of paper. “The task that Kirsten called about is delivering a test\n\nenvironment to QA. As she said, Brent estimated that it would take only\n\nforty-five minutes.”\n\n“Sounds about right,” Wes says. “You just need to create a new\n\nvirtualized server and then install the OS and a couple of packages on it. He\n\nprobably even doubled the time estimate to be safe.”",

      "content": "“That’s what I thought, too,” Patty said, but she’s shaking her head.\n\n“Except it’s not just one task. What Brent signed up for is more like a small\n\nproject—there’s over twenty steps involving at least six different teams!\n\nYou need the OS and all the software packages, license keys, dedicated IP\n\naddress, special user accounts set up, mount points configured, and then\n\nyou need the IP addresses to be added to an ACL list on some file server. In\n\nthis particular case, the requirements say that we need a physical server, so\n\nwe also need a router port, cabling, and a server rack where we have\n\nenough space.”\n\n“Oh, for chrissakes…,” Wes says, sounding exasperated, reading what\n\nPatty is pointing at. He mumbles, “Physical servers are such a pain in the\n\nass.”\n\n“You’re missing the point. This would still be happening, even if it were\n\nvirtualized,” Patty says. “First, Brent’s ‘task’ turns out to be considerably\n\nmore than just a task. Second, we’re finding that it’s multiple tasks\n\nspanning multiple people, each of whom have their own urgent work to do.\n\nWe’re losing days at each handoff. At this rate, without some dramatic\n\nintervention, it’ll be weeks before QA gets what they need.”\n\n“At least we don’t need a firewall change,” Wes says, snidely. “Last\n\ntime we needed one of those, it took John’s group almost a month. Four\n\nweeks for a thirty-second change!”\n\nI nod, knowing exactly what Wes is referring to. The lead time for\n\nfirewall changes has become legendary.\n\nWait. Didn’t Erik mention something like this? For a firewall change,\n\neven though the work only required thirty seconds of touch time, it still\n\ntook four weeks of clock time.\n\nThat’s just a microcosm of what’s happening with Brent. But what’s\n\nhappening to us right now is much, much worse, because there are\n\nhandoffs.\n\nWith a groan, I put my head on the conference table.\n\n“You okay?” Patty asks.\n\n“Give me a second,” I say. I walk up to the whiteboard and struggle to\n\ndraw a graph with one of the markers. After a couple of tries, I end up with\n\na graph that looks like this:\n\nI tell them what Erik told me at MRP-8, about how wait times depend\n\nupon resource utilization. “The wait time is the ‘percentage of time busy’\n\ndivided by the ‘percentage of time idle.’ In other words, if a resource is fifty\n\npercent busy, then it’s fifty percent idle. The wait time is fifty percent\n\ndivided by fifty percent, so one unit of time. Let’s call it one hour. So, on\n\naverage, our task would wait in the queue for one hour before it gets\n\nworked.\n\n“On the other hand, if a resource is ninety percent busy, the wait time is\n\n‘ninety percent divided by ten percent’, or nine hours. In other words, our\n\ntask would wait in queue nine times longer than if the resource were fifty\n\npercent idle.”\n\nI conclude, “So, for the Phoenix task, assuming we have seven handoffs,\n\nand that each of those resources is busy ninety percent of the time, the tasks\n\nwould spend in queue a total of nine hours times the seven steps…”\n\n“What? Sixty-three hours, just in queue time?” Wes says, incredulously.\n\n“That’s impossible!”\n\nPatty says with a smirk, “Oh, of course. Because it’s only thirty seconds\n\nof typing, right?”\n\n“Oh, shit,” Wes says, staring at the graph.\n\nSuddenly, I recall my conversation with Wes right before Sarah and\n\nChris decided to deploy Phoenix at Kirsten’s meeting. Wes complained\n\nabout tickets related to Phoenix bouncing around for weeks, which delayed\n\nthe deployment.\n\nIt was happening then, too. That wasn’t a handoff between IT Operations\n\npeople. That was a handoff between the Development and IT Operations\n\norganization, which is far more complex.\n\nCreating and prioritizing work inside a department is hard. Managing\n\nwork among departments must be at least ten times more difficult.\n\nPatty says, “What that graph says is that everyone needs idle time, or\n\nslack time. If no one has slack time, WIP gets stuck in the system. Or more\n\nspecifically, stuck in queues, just waiting.”\n\nAs we digest this, Patty continues. “Each of those sheets of paper on the\n\nboard is like this Phoenix ‘task,’” she says, making air quotes with her\n\nhands. “It looks like a single person task, but it’s not. It’s actually multiple\n\nsteps with multiple handoffs among multiple people. No wonder Kirsten’s\n\nproject estimates are off.\n\n“We need to correct this on Kirsten’s schedule and her work breakdown\n\nstructure, or WBS. Based on what I’ve seen, fully one-third of our\n\ncommitments to Kirsten fall into this category.”\n\n“Just great,” Wes says. “It’s like Gilligan’s Island. We keep sending\n\npeople off on three-hour tours, and months later, we wonder why none of\n\nthem come back.”\n\nPatty says, “I wonder if we could create a kanban lane for each of these\n\n‘tasks?’”\n\n“Yes, that’s it,” I say. “Erik was right. You’ve just found a big pile of\n\nrecurring work! If we can document and standardize this recurring work,\n\nand gain some mastery over it, just like you did with laptop replacement,\n\nI’m sure we can improve flow!”\n\nI add, “You know, if we can standardize all our recurring deployment\n\nwork, we’ll finally be able to enforce uniformity of our production\n\nconfigurations. That would be our infrastructure snowflake problem—you\n\nknow—no two alike. How Brent turned into Brent is that we allowed him to\n\nbuild infrastructure only he can understand. We can’t let that happen again.”\n\n“Good point,” Wes grunts. “You know, it’s odd. So many of these\n\nproblems we’ve been facing are caused by decisions we made. We have met\n\nthe enemy. And he is us.”\n\nPatty says, “You know, deployments are like final assembly in a\n\nmanufacturing plant. Every flow of work goes through it, and you can’t ship\n\nthe product without it. Suddenly, I know exactly what the kanban should\n\nlook like.”\n\nOver the next forty-five minutes, we create our plan. Patty is going to\n\nwork with Wes’ team to assemble the top twenty most frequently recurring\n\ntasks.\n\nShe will also figure out how to better manage and control tasks when\n\nthey are queued. Patty proposes a new role, a combination of a project\n\nmanager and expediter. Instead of day-by-day oversight, they would\n\nprovide minute-by-minute control. She says, “We need fast and effective\n\nhandoffs of any completed work to the next work center. If necessary, this\n\nperson will wait at the work center until the work is completed and carry to\n\nthe next work center. We’ll never let critical work get lost in a pile of tickets\n\nagain.”\n\n“What? Someone assigned to carry around tasks from person to person,\n\nlike a waiter?” Wes asks in disbelief.\n\n“At MRP-8, they have a ‘water spider’ role that does exactly that,” she\n\ncounters. “Almost all of this latest Phoenix delay was due to tasks waiting\n\nin queues or handoffs. This will make sure it doesn’t happen again.\n\n“Eventually,” she adds, “I’ll want to move all the kanbans, so that we\n\ndon’t need a person acting as the signaling mechanism for work handoffs.\n\nDon’t worry. I’ll have it figured out in a couple of days.”\n\nWes and I don’t dare doubt her.\n\nChapter 24 • Saturday, October 11\n\nThe following Saturday was relatively peaceful. In fact, it’s the most\n\nrelaxing weekend my family has had since I took my new job. With\n\nHalloween a few weeks away, Paige insisted that we take the whole family\n\nout to the pumpkin patch.\n\nIt was a chilly Saturday morning, so we were exhausted just bundling up\n\nthe kids and getting them in the car. When we arrived at the nearby farm,\n\nPaige and I laughed uncontrollably at Parker, who looked like a giant, angry\n\nsausage stuffed into his blue parka. She couldn’t resist taking pictures while\n\nGrant orbited us in excitement, taking pictures with his own camera.\n\nAfterward, we went to a local microbrewery, enjoying lunch on the patio\n\nin the warm afternoon sun.\n\n“I’m so glad we could do this,” Paige says. “It’s really nice. You seem\n\nless stressed lately. I can really tell things are getting better.”\n\nShe’s right. It felt like we had turned a corner at work somehow. Just\n\nlike how I wasn’t wasting as much time fighting my ancient laptop, it\n\nseemed like my team was spending more and more of our time doing\n\nproductive work and less and less firefighting.\n\nAlthough I know getting a new laptop has absolutely nothing to do with\n\nour organizational performance, getting rid of that old clunker was like\n\ngetting rid of a thousand-pound anchor that someone had tied around my\n\nneck while I was swimming across the ocean.\n\nWe’re still grappling with gradually melting the project freeze. I’m\n\nguessing that we’ll probably be able to unfreeze twenty-five percent of all",

      "content": "the projects, along with a bunch of other new projects designed to further\n\nelevate Brent.\n\nThere were still so many uncertainties. But unlike before, our challenges\n\nfeel within our ability to understand and conquer. Our goals finally seem\n\nachievable. I no longer feel like I am always on my heels, with more and\n\nmore people piling on, trying to push me over.\n\nWith the business agreeing, with the exception of Sarah, on what the\n\npriorities are, my job actually seems fair. It feels like we have the initiative\n\nand are attacking the problem, instead of the other way around.\n\nI like it.\n\nI look up to see Paige smiling back at me and then yell out in panic as I\n\nsee Parker knocking over her glass of beer.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon passes too quickly, but it’s one of the best days\n\nI’ve had all year.\n\nLater that evening, Paige is curled up with me on the couch. We’re\n\nwatching the Clint Eastwood movie Pale Rider. The kids have gone to\n\nsleep, and this is the first time we’ve actually watched a movie together in\n\nmonths.\n\nI laugh uncontrollably watching the main character, “the Preacher”\n\nplayed by Eastwood, methodically pick off the gang of nine evil deputies.\n\nPaige looks at me with amused disapproval.\n\n“What exactly is so funny about this?” she asks.\n\nThis makes me laugh harder. When another deputy gets shot in the\n\nbackground, I say, “Look at that! You know what’s going to happen, but the\n\nmarshal just stands there in the middle of the street, watching the carnage!\n\nLook at the way the wind rustles through his coat! And his gun isn’t even\n\ndrawn! I love it!”\n\n“I’ll never understand you,” Paige says, shaking her head with a smile.\n\nJust then, my cell phone rings. I instinctively reach for it.\n\nHoly crap. It’s John. No one has seen or heard from him since that audit\n\nmeeting, over two weeks ago. We’re pretty sure he hasn’t been fired, but no\n\none knows more than that. I’ve been meaning to check the local hospitals to\n\nmake sure he’s not convalescing alone somewhere.\n\nAs much as I want to talk with him, I don’t want to leave Paige and the\n\nmovie. I look at the clock, and see that there’s probably only fifteen more\n\nminutes until the end. Not wanting to miss the final gunfight, I mute the\n\nphone. I’ll call him back when the movie is over.\n\nA couple of seconds later, my phone rings again, and I again hit the\n\nmute button.\n\nMy phone rings again. For the third time, I mute the phone, but quickly\n\nsend him a text message: Grt hearing from u. Can’t talk right now. Will call\n\nu in 20m.\n\nUnbelievably, my phone buzzes again, so I turn the ringer off, putting\n\nmy phone underneath some cushions on the couch.\n\nPaige asks, “Who keeps calling?”\n\nWhen I say, “John,” she rolls her eyes, and we watch the remaining ten\n\nminutes of the movie.\n\n“I can’t believe I haven’t seen that movie until tonight!” I say, giving\n\nPaige a squeeze. “That was such a great idea, darling!”\n\n“It’s been a great day. It’s so nice having a normal life again,” she says,\n\nreturning my hug, and then with a smile, she gets up, taking the empty beer\n\nbottles with her.\n\nI agree. I pick up my phone, my heart skipping a beat when I see “15\n\nmissed calls.”\n\nSuddenly afraid that I may have missed something truly disastrous, I\n\nquickly look to see who called. Every call was from John. I call him\n\nimmediately.\n\n“Billy, so good to hear your voice again—my friend—my dear, dear\n\nold—dear ol’ friend,” he slurs. Good Lord. He’s completely drunk.\n\n“Sorry I couldn’t return your calls right away. I was out with Paige,” I\n\nsay, feeling guilty at my slight mistruth.\n\n“No problem. Look, I just wanted to see you one—one lasht time before\n\nI left—be leaving,” he says.\n\n“Leaving? What do you mean ‘leaving’? Where are you going?” I say\n\nwith alarm, wondering how long he’s been drinking. Maybe I should have\n\ncalled back sooner. I suddenly visualize him on the other end of the phone\n\nwith an open bottle of sleeping pills in his hand, already half-empty.\n\nI hear him laugh, maybe a bit hysterically. “Don’t worry, Billy. I’m not\n\ngoing to kill myself. Haven’t had enough to drink—yet. Har-har! I just\n\nwanted to see you before I left town tonight. Let me buy you one last\n\ndrink.”\n\n“Uh, can’t this wait until tomorrow? It’s almost midnight,” I say,\n\nslightly relieved.\n\nHe tells me that he’ll be long gone by tomorrow and convinces me to\n\njoin him at the Hammerhead Saloon downtown.\n\nWhen I pull into the parking lot, I immediately spot John’s Volvo station\n\nwagon. Hitched behind his car is a U-Haul trailer, and there’s a pile of\n\nempty beer cans right outside the driver’s side door.\n\nI find him in a booth at the back of the crowded bar, and it’s obvious\n\nhe’s been here all day. He doesn’t seem to have bathed or changed his\n\nclothes since I last saw him. His hair is greasy and wildly askew as if he just\n\nwoke up, his face is covered in stubble, and there are food stains on his\n\nshirt. His keys and wallet have been tossed carelessly next to the salt and\n\npepper shakers.\n\nJohn urgently waves over a waitress, taking a moment to rehearse his\n\nwords, but still slurring as he says, “I’d like two double scotches, neat, for\n\nme and my friend here. And those yummy nachos… Please.”\n\nShe looks over at me questioningly, obviously having already served\n\nhim plenty. I nod, but say quietly, “Let’s start with two cups of coffee,\n\nplease. I’ll take care of him.” As I say it, I reach over and take his keys off\n\nthe table.\n\nFor a moment, she looks dubious but gives me a small smile and walks\n\naway.\n\n“Dude, you look like shit,” I say candidly.\n\n“Thanks, pal. So do you,” he replies, before bursting out laughing.\n\n“Nice. Where the hell have you been? Everyone has been looking for\n\nyou,” I say.\n\n“I’ve been at home,” he says, grabbing some popcorn from our table.\n\n“I’ve been mostly reading and watching TV. Whoa, there is some crazy shit\n\non TV these days. Crazy! But then I started thinking it’s time for me to move\n\non, so I spent most of today packing. I just wanted to ask you one little\n\nquestion before I left.”\n\n“You mentioned that on the phone,” I say, as the waitress arrives with\n\ntwo cups of coffee and the nachos. John looks with confusion at the mugs\n\non the table, so I say, “Don’t worry. Our drinks are on the way.”\n\nWhen I get him to take a sip of coffee, he asks, “Just tell me straight. Is\n\nit really true that I haven’t done anything of value for you? In all the three\n\nyears that we’ve worked together, I’ve never, ever been helpful?”\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to decide what to tell him. A friend told me\n\nyears ago, “To tell the truth is an act of love. To withhold the truth is an act\n\nof hate. Or worse, apathy.”\n\nI had laughed at those words at the time, but over the years, I’ve realized\n\nthat having people give you honest feedback is a rare gift. Looking across at\n\nJohn, even though he looks like a completely broken man, I wonder\n\nwhether the right thing to do is to just let him off easy and tell him what he\n\nwants to hear.\n\nFinally, I say, “Look, John. You’re a good guy, and I know your heart is\n\nin the right place, but up until you helped hide us from the PCI auditors\n\nduring the Phoenix meltdown, I would have said no. I know that’s not what\n\nyou want to hear, but…I wanted to make sure that I wasn’t feeding you a\n\nline of bullshit.”\n\nAmazingly, John looks even more crestfallen than before. “Where’s that\n\ngoddamned scotch?” he yells out. Turning back to look at me, he says, “Are\n\nyou serious? After three whole goddamned years of working together,\n\nyou’re telling me that I haven’t helped you, not even in the slightest bit?”\n\n“Well, for most of those years, I was in charge of the midrange group,\n\nwhich you didn’t get too involved with,” I explain calmly. “We found our\n\nown security guidance on the web. When we did interact, you just tried to\n\ndump a bunch of work on me. Look, I care about security, and we always\n\nlook for risks to our systems and data, but we’re always up to our eyeballs\n\nin urgent work, trying to keep our heads above water. And in my new role,\n\nI’m just trying to help the company survive.”\n\nJohn says, “But don’t you see, that’s what I’m trying to do, too! I’m just\n\ntrying to help you and the business survive!”\n\nI reply, “I know. But, in my world, I’m responsible for keeping all our\n\nservices up and running, and deploying new services like Phoenix. Security\n\nhad to take a backseat. Trust me, I’m well aware of the risks of bad security,\n\nand I know it would be a career-ending move to have a large-scale security\n\nbreach on my watch.”\n\nI shrug my shoulders. “I’m making the best possible decisions given my\n\nknowledge of the risks. I just don’t think that all the stuff you wanted me to\n\ndo would have helped the business as much as all the other things on my\n\nplate.\n\n“Come on,” I continue, “Does it bother you deep down that the business\n\ngot through the SOX-404 audit without you? Does that make you question\n\nthe importance and validity of your recommendations?”\n\nJohn just stares back at me.\n\nAs if on cue, our waitress arrives with the two scotches. John picks his\n\nup, and finishes it in one gulp. “Another round, please.”\n\nWhen she looks at me, I shake my head and mouth the words, “Check,\n\nplease? And call a cab?”\n\nShe nods and disappears. I take a sip of my scotch and look back at\n\nJohn. His head is now lolling backward and he’s muttering something. By\n\nnow, he’s completely unintelligible.\n\nI feel sorry for him.\n\nI take his wallet off the table.\n\n“Hey!” he says.\n\n“Our waitress is tipping out, and I’ve got to pay her, but, I forgot my\n\nwallet at home,” I say.\n\nHe laughs at me, looking at me blearily. “No problem, old pal. I’ll get\n\nthis one. I always get them, don’t I?”\n\n“Thanks,” I say, and grab his driver’s license. I wave over the waitress\n\nand point to his home address.\n\nReturning John’s wallet, I pull out my own and pay.\n\nI help John up and pour him into the cab, making sure his wallet and\n\nkeys are back in his pocket. Not wanting John to deal with the cabbie, I pay\n\nthe cabbie, too.\n\nWatching him leave, and then looking at his station wagon and U-Haul\n\nfull of only a fraction of his worldly belongings, I just shake my head. I\n\nhead back to my car, wondering when I’m going to see him next.\n\nThe next day, I call John a couple of times on his cell phone, but he never\n\nanswers. I finally leave him a voicemail telling him that I hoped he got\n\nhome okay, where his car was, and to give me a ring if he needs anything.\n\nThe rumor mill is abuzz. There’s talk that he was hospitalized, arrested,\n\nabducted by aliens, or locked up in a mental institution.\n\nI’m not sure how these rumors were starting, as I didn’t tell anyone\n\nabout my late-night meeting with him, nor was I ever going to.\n\nI’m just finishing up putting Grant to bed on Monday night when I get a\n\ntext message from John. I quickly read it: Thanks for the lift home the other\n\nday. Been thinking. I told Dick that u’ll be joining our 8am mtg tomorrow.\n\nShould be interesting.\n\nWhat meeting with Dick?\n\nI stare at my phone. On the one hand, John is alive and seems able to\n\nwork. That’s good.\n\nOn the other hand, John is now talking about meeting with Dick, the\n\nsecond most powerful executive in the company, tomorrow morning,\n\npotentially in some mentally unbalanced state and has already broadcast\n\nthat I’m his coconspirator.\n\nThat’s not so good. I quickly tap out my reply to him: Good hearing\n\nfrom u. Hope you’re doing ok? What is Dick meeting about? May not be\n\nable to make it.\n\nHe responds immediately: I’ve been arrogant. Realized yest that I don’t\n\nactually know much about Dick. Must change that. Together.\n\nWorried that John may be completely off his rocker, I immediately call\n\nhim. He answers on the first ring, sounding oddly cheery. I hear him say,\n\n“Good evening, Bill. Thanks again for Saturday night. What’s up?”\n\n“What exactly are you up to, John?” I say. “What’s this meeting\n\ntomorrow with Dick about, and why are you dragging me into it?”\n\nHe replies, “I spent most of yesterday in bed, since I could barely get\n\nmyself to the bathroom and back. My head felt like it was a lemon smashed\n\nby a brick. What drinks were you buying me that night?”\n\nHe doesn’t wait for me to answer before continuing, “I kept thinking\n\nabout our last conversation at the bar. I realized that if I haven’t done\n\nanything useful for you, who I should have the most in common with, then\n\nit stands to reason that I haven’t been useful to almost everyone else, who I\n\nhave nothing in common with.\n\n“That’s got to change,” he says adamantly.\n\nI bite my tongue, wanting to hear John out before I recommend that he\n\ncancel tomorrow’s meeting.\n\nHe continues, “I kept thinking about what Erik said, that he’d be ready\n\nto talk to me when Dick says he wants me around.”\n\n“Uh, I don’t think a quick thirty-minute ‘getting to know you’ meeting is\n\ngoing to get you there,” I say, seriously skeptical.\n\nHe responds with complete calm, “Wouldn’t you agree, like so many\n\nthings in life, that we must always start by at least gaining an understanding\n\nof the person we’re dealing with? What could go wrong? I just want to learn\n\nmore about his job.”\n\nIn my head, I immediately envision John asking or saying something\n\nstupid, completely pissing Dick off, and Dick firing him on the spot, and\n\nthen firing me, too, just to eliminate the contagion.\n\nYet I find myself saying, “Okay, I’ll be there.”\n\nChapter 25 • Tuesday, October 14\n\nThe next morning at 7:50 a.m., I’m heading toward Dick’s office. As I\n\nround the corner, I see John already chatting amiably with Dick’s assistant.\n\nMy jaw drops. John’s physical appearance has completely changed.\n\nHe’s obviously showered and cleaned up. He’s also shaved his head and\n\nappears to have lost fifteen pounds. He’s wearing what I can only describe\n\nas a European styled shirt and a vest. Unlike the slightly baggy shirts he\n\nusually wears, the pink shirt he’s wearing fits tightly on him. Combined\n\nwith the vest, he looks like a…fashion model? London clubber? Las Vegas\n\ncard dealer?\n\nWith the shaved head, his calm friendly smile and perfect posture, he\n\nlooks like some sort of enlightened monk.\n\nMost significantly, I notice that his three-ring binder is nowhere to be\n\nseen. Instead, he’s carrying only a pristine black and white lab notebook\n\nand a pen.\n\n“Good morning, Bill,” John says with beatific calm.\n\n“Hi,” I finally say. “Uh, you’re looking better than the last time I saw\n\nyou.”\n\nHe just smiles, and then says something quietly to Dick’s assistant that\n\nmakes her clap her hands over mouth and laugh loudly. She then gets up,\n\nwalks over to Dick’s door and gestures both of us to follow her, saying,\n\n“Let’s see if we can start your meeting a little early. It’ll give you more time\n\nwith him.”\n\nI’m walking into Dick’s office, trailing behind John.",

      "content": "“Nice haircut,” Dick says to John with a smile, pointing at his own bald\n\nhead. Then in a business-like tone, he says, “So what can I do for you? I\n\nhave a commitment at 8:30, so let’s not waste time.”\n\nJohn opens his notebook to the first page, which is completely blank.\n\n“Thanks for taking the time to meet with us on such short notice. I promise\n\nyou that we won’t waste your time. And to make sure I don’t have any\n\nincorrect or preconceived notions, could you start by telling us what exactly\n\nyou do here at Parts Unlimited? What is your exact role?”\n\nMy eyes widen in horror at John’s question. This is what gets asked on\n\nBring Your Kid To Work Day but not by company executives.\n\nI quickly look over to gauge Dick’s reaction. He looks surprised for a\n\nmoment, but then blandly replies, “Interesting question.”\n\nHe pauses briefly and then seems to just play along. “I started here at\n\nParts Unlimited fifteen years ago as CFO, which, back then, was defined in a\n\npretty traditional way. I was primarily responsible for managing the\n\nfinancial risks of the organization and leading the financial planning and\n\noperations processes. Even back then, we had a huge number of regulatory\n\ncompliance issues, which I also owned.\n\n“Shortly after Steve became CEO, he told me that we needed a senior\n\nexecutive to own planning and operations across the entire organization and\n\nthen gave those responsibilities to me. To help ensure that the company\n\nachieves our goals, I set up the objectives and measurements program for\n\nthe entire management team. I wanted to keep all our managers\n\naccountable, ensure that they have the skills necessary to succeed, and help\n\nmake sure that complex initiatives always have the right stakeholders\n\ninvolved and so forth.”\n\nJohn looks up from furiously taking notes on the first page in his new\n\nnotebook. “I’ve heard many people call you the ‘de facto COO’ around here,\n\nand that you’re basically Steve’s right-hand man.”\n\nDick considers his comments for a moment, before saying, “My official\n\ntitle doesn’t have ‘operations’ anywhere in it, but it’s the part of my job that\n\nI love most. When a company is as big as we are, with so many business\n\nprocesses, so many managers and workers, almost everything is complex.\n\nAs smart as Steve is, even he needs help making sure the company strategy\n\nand goals are realistic and making an objective assessment of what we’re\n\nactually capable of.”\n\nWith a very small smile, he adds, “Want to hear something funny?\n\nPeople say that I’m more approachable than Steve! Steve’s incredibly\n\ncharismatic, and let’s face it, I’m an asshole. But when people have\n\nconcerns, they don’t want to have their minds changed. They want someone\n\nto listen to them and help make sure Steve gets the message.”\n\nI find myself leaning forward. I’m surprised to hear Dick giving John,\n\nand therefore me, such candid and informative answers.\n\n“What differentiates a good day from a bad day for you?” John\n\ncontinues.\n\nMomentarily taken aback, Dick laughs loudly. “I’ll tell you what a good\n\nday feels like. It feels like the end of the year when we’re beating the pants\n\noff the competition—when we haven’t closed the books yet, but everyone\n\nknows that it’s going to be a monster quarter. All the sales people would\n\nhave hit quota, and the ones on top would have hit their accelerators. A\n\ngood day feels like my staff panicking about the size of the commission\n\nchecks we’re going to be writing them.\n\n“I’m not worried, because those big commission checks would mean the\n\ncompany is making money,” he says, smiling even more broadly. “Steve\n\nwould be excited to announce to Wall Street and the analysts how well the\n\ncompany is performing—all made possible because we had a winning\n\nstrategy, and also because we had the right plan and the ability to operate\n\nand execute. It means that we got all the parts of this organization to click\n\nas a team and win.\n\n“That’s a fun day for me. We can plan and plan until the cows come\n\nhome, but until we execute and achieve the goals, it’s academic,” he says.\n\nThen his smile disappears. “Of course, we haven’t had a day like that in\n\nover four years…\n\n“A bad day is like the one we had two weeks ago,” he says, now looking\n\nfrustrated and even angry. “We can’t close the quarter because of some IT\n\nfailure, we can’t seem to execute on our most critical project to close the\n\ngap with the competition, we keep losing customers, the auditors are\n\nmaking noises about some restatement project, and the board of directors is\n\ndebating whether to fire all of us because we’re such screwups.”\n\nDick shakes his head, with a wan, tired smile, “In those moments, you\n\nwonder whether the problem is the economy, our strategy, our management\n\nteam, you IT guys, or, quite frankly, maybe the entire problem is me. Those\n\nare the days I just want to retire.”\n\nJohn looks down at his notes and then asks, “What are your goals,\n\nobjectives, and measurements for this year?”\n\nDick gets up from the sitting area to walk to his desk, saying, “Here, I’ll\n\nshow you.”\n\nHe picks up a thin, black three-ring binder that was open on his desk,\n\nsits back down across from us, and shows us the open binder. “Here are two\n\nslides I look at every day.”\n\nCFO GOALS\n\nHealth of company\n\nRevenue\n\nMarket share\n\nAverage order size\n\nProfitability\n\nReturn on assets\n\nHealth of Finance\n\nOrder to cash cycle\n\nAccounts receivable\n\nAccurate and timely financial reporting\n\nBorrowing costs\n\n“These are the company goals and the objectives I’ve set for finance,”\n\nhe explains. “I’ve learned that while the finance goals are important, they’re\n\nnot the most important. Finance can hit all our objectives, and the company\n\nstill can fail. After all, the best accounts receivables team on the planet can’t\n\nsave us if we’re in the wrong market with the wrong product strategy with\n\nan R&D team that can’t deliver.”\n\nStartled, I realize he’s talking about Erik’s First Way. He’s talking about\n\nsystems thinking, always confirming that the entire organization achieves\n\nits goal, not just one part of it.\n\nAs I’m pondering this, Dick then points to the second slide, saying, “So\n\nthat’s what’s on the second slide, which shows what I believe are the more\n\nimportant company goals. I look at this slide every day.”\n\nAre we competitive?\n\nUnderstanding customer needs and wants: Do we know what to build? Product portfolio: Do we have the right products? R&D effectiveness: Can we build it effectively? Time to market: Can we ship it soon enough to matter? Sales pipeline: Can we convert products to interested prospects? Are we effective? Customer on-time delivery: Are customers getting what we promised them? Customer retention: Are we gaining or losing customers? Sales forecast accuracy: Can we factor this into our sales planning process?\n\nJohn and I lean forward to study the slide. Usually company managers\n\nlike me only see our departmental objectives. This slide shows the bigger\n\npicture.\n\nAs I’m thinking, John points at the slide and asks, “Which of these\n\nmeasurements are most at risk?”\n\nDick laughs humorlessly. “All of them! From a product portfolio\n\nperspective, the competition is killing us and taking market share away\n\nfrom us each day. We’re $20 million and years into Project Phoenix, and\n\nwe’re still not competitive in the market yet. On the retailing and\n\nmanufacturing side of the business, customer satisfaction is dropping, and\n\nwe’re losing customers, despite Sales’ promise that we can win them back\n\nsomehow.”\n\nJohn underlines some of his notes. “Can we have a copy of this? Bill\n\nand I would like to study this further and make sure our teams understand\n\nthis, so we can ensure that everything we do helps advance these goals.”\n\nDick thinks for a moment. “Sure. Can’t hurt, I suppose. I’ll have my\n\nassistant give you both a copy on your way out.”\n\n“One more thing,” John says. “For each of these initiatives and\n\nmeasurements, who are the managers held responsible and accountable?”\n\nDick looks at John appraisingly, as do I. I’ve never seen this side of\n\nJohn before, either.\n\nDick says, “My assistant will get you the spreadsheet with those names\n\non it, as well.”\n\nJohn thanks him and then looks at his watch. “We’re almost out of time.\n\nThis has been really terrific. Thank you for taking the time to tell us about\n\nyour daily life. Is there anything that either of us can do for you?”\n\n“Sure,” he replies. “Stay focused and get Phoenix working. Without it,\n\nwe are stuck in the mud.”\n\nI frown. I look at the second slide again. I feel like Phoenix is not what\n\nDick should be asking me to focus on.\n\nUnable to articulate why, I merely say, “Yes, sir. We’ll surely have some\n\ngood news to share by the end of the month.” I’m not entirely sure what\n\nthat good news will be, but I’ve learned that when dealing with senior\n\nofficers, there’s a time and a place for telling bad news. This is neither of\n\nthem.\n\n“Good,” he says, giving us a tight-lipped smile.\n\nWe exchange parting pleasantries and head out of his office.\n\nAs the elevator doors open, John says to me, “You know, I think there’s\n\nsomething very similar about us dodging the SOX-404 audit bullet and\n\nwhat’s on Dick’s second slide,” he says. “I can’t quite put my finger on it,\n\nbut I think there’s something here that we need to understand better.”\n\n“You’re right,” I say. “I don’t think Dick realizes how much his\n\nmeasurements depend on IT. He asked me about Phoenix, but he should\n\nhave asked me about all the objectives.”\n\nWe both step into the elevator. I continue, “Are you available later today\n\nto meet? Let’s see if we can connect all these dots. I suspect that we’re\n\nsitting on the missing link that might explain both why the company keeps\n\nmissing its goals as well as why IT keeps being undervalued.”\n\n“Absolutely,” he says excitedly.\n\nI can barely contain my sense of excitement. John’s crazy meeting with\n\nDick seems to have revealed something genuinely important.\n\nI believe with utter certainty that whatever we’re trying to figure out is\n\ncritical to the First Way. He talked about the need to understand the true\n\nbusiness context that IT resides in.\n\nI’m pretty sure no one has linked Dick’s top measurements to the\n\nprerequisite IT objectives.\n\nNo wonder Dick just has a vague sense that IT is screwing up—it’s a\n\ndull, throbbing ache that he can’t localize. Our next step is obvious: We\n\nmust make those pains very specific and visible to convince Dick that IT is\n\ncapable of not just screwing up less often but helping all of the business\n\nwin.\n\nThis is too important and urgent to struggle blindly in the dark, and I\n\nneed to call Erik for advice. Standing in the lobby of Building 2, I speed-\n\ndial him.\n\n“Yeah?” I hear him answer.\n\nI say, “Good morning, Erik. I’ve just had a remarkable meeting with\n\nDick. Do you have some time to help me think this through?”\n\nWhen he grunts, “Yes,” I describe to him the meeting and how it came\n\nabout and my certainty that it has uncovered something critical.\n\n“Well, good for Jimmy. Or maybe I should call him ‘John.’ He finally\n\ngot his head far enough out of his ass to begin to see,” I hear Erik say as he\n\nlaughs, not unkindly. “As part of the First Way, you must gain a true\n\nunderstanding of the business system that IT operates in. W. Edwards\n\nDeming called this ‘appreciation for the system.’ When it comes to IT, you\n\nface two difficulties: On the one hand, in Dick’s second slide, you now see\n\nthat there are organizational commitments that IT is responsible for helping\n\nuphold and protect that no one has verbalized precisely yet. On the other\n\nhand, John has discovered that some IT controls he holds near and dear\n\naren’t needed, because other parts of the organization are adequately\n\nmitigating those risks.\n\n“This is all about scoping what really matters inside of IT. And like\n\nwhen Mr. Sphere told everyone in Flatland, you must leave the realm of IT\n\nto discover where the business relies on IT to achieve its goals.” I hear him\n\ncontinue, “Your mission is twofold: You must find where you’ve under-\n\nscoped IT—where certain portions of the processes and technology you\n\nmanage actively jeopardizes the achievement of business goals—as\n\ncodified by Dick’s measurements. And secondly, John must find where he’s\n\nover-scoped IT, such as all those SOX-404 IT controls that weren’t necessary\n\nto detect material errors in the financial statements.\n\n“You may think that we’re mixing apples and oranges, but I assure you\n\nthat we are not,” he continues. “Some of the wisest auditors say that there\n\nare only three internal control objectives: to gain assurance for reliability of\n\nfinancial reporting, compliance with laws and regulations, and efficiency\n\nand effectiveness of operations. That’s it. What you and John are talking\n\nabout are just different slides of what is called the ‘COSO Cube.’”\n\nI force myself to keep listening, furiously taking notes so I can Google\n\nthese terms later.\n\nI hear him continue, “Here’s what you and John need to do: Go talk to\n\nthe business process owners for the objectives on Dick’s second slide. Find\n\nout what their exact roles are, what business processes underpin their goals,\n\nand then get from them the top list of things that jeopardize those goals.\n\n“You must understand the value chains required to achieve each of\n\nDick’s goals, including the ones that aren’t so visible, like those in IT. For\n\ninstance, if you were a cross-country freight shipping company that delivers\n\npackages using a fleet of one hundred trucks, one of your corporate goals\n\nwould be customer satisfaction and on-time delivery.”\n\nI hear him continue, “Everybody knows that one factor jeopardizing on-\n\ntime delivery is vehicle breakdowns. A key causal factor for vehicle\n\nbreakdowns is failure to change the oil. So, to mitigate that risk, you’d\n\ncreate an SLA for vehicle operations to change the oil every five thousand\n\nmiles.”\n\nObviously enjoying himself, he keeps explaining, “Our organizational\n\nkey performance indicator (KPI) is on-time delivery. So to achieve it, you\n\nwould create a new forward-looking KPI of, say, the percentage of vehicles\n\nthat have had their required oil changes performed.\n\n“After all, if only fifty percent of our vehicles are complying with the\n\nrequired maintenance policies, it’s a good bet that in the near future, our on-\n\ntime delivery KPIs are going to take a dive, when trucks start getting\n\nstranded on the side of the road, along with all the packages they’re\n\ncarrying.\n\n“People think that just because IT doesn’t use motor oil and carry\n\nphysical packages that it doesn’t need preventive maintenance,” Erik says,\n\nchuckling to himself. “That somehow, because the work and the cargo that\n\nIT carries are invisible, you just need to sprinkle more magic dust on the\n\ncomputers to get them running again.\n\n“Metaphors like oil changes help people make that connection.\n\nPreventive oil changes and vehicle maintenance policies are like preventive\n\nvendor patches and change management policies. By showing how IT risks\n\njeopardize business performance measures, you can start making better\n\nbusiness decisions.\n\n“Okay, one last thing before I go,” he says. “Make sure John fulfills his\n\nmission. He must talk with the finance side of the SOX-404 audit team. He\n\nmust learn exactly how the business managed to dodge the last audit bullet\n\nand what the actual control environment looks like and where reliance is\n\nreally placed. And he must then explain it to you.\n\n“You’ll be ready for your meeting with Dick when you’ve built out the\n\nvalue chains, linking his objectives to how IT jeopardizes it. Assembling\n\nconcrete examples of how IT issues have jeopardized those goals in the past.\n\nMake sure you’re prepared.”\n\nAnd with that, he says, “In fact, feel free to invite me to that meeting. I\n\nwant to see Dick’s face when you present what you learn,” and he hangs up\n\nthe phone.\n\nChapter 26 • Friday, October 17\n\nWhen Patty enters the conference room, she gasps loudly when she sees\n\nJohn’s transformed appearance. “Oh my God, John. You look fantastic!”\n\nSurprisingly, when Wes arrives, he doesn’t seem to notice anything\n\ndifferent.\n\nWhen everyone is here, I quickly share what I had learned from Erik.\n\nWe decide that Patty and I will start the business process-owner interviews\n\nfor “understanding customer needs and wants,” “product portfolio,” “time\n\nto market,” and “sales pipeline,” while John will research the business SOX-\n\n404 control environment, as directed by Erik.\n\nIt’s Friday and we’re scheduled to interview Ron Johnson, the VP of\n\nManufacturing Sales. I worked with him years ago as part of the acquisition\n\nintegration project and am surprised he’s in town. He’s usually out and\n\nabout, traveling the world, helping to negotiate deals and save troubled\n\naccounts. He has a well-deserved reputation as one of the most fun people\n\nin the company to travel with. The size of his expense reports proves it.\n\nPatty and I are sitting in front of his desk in Building 2. As we listen to\n\nhim bellow at his colleagues on a conference call, I look at the many\n\npictures of him on the wall: on golf courses, with his top sales people in\n\nexotic locales from decades of President’s Clubs, and shaking hands with\n\ncustomers. In the corner is a fake potted tree, completely covered with\n\nhundreds of conference badges and lanyards.\n\nThis is definitely the office of someone who loves being in front of\n\npeople. He’s a large, gregarious guy with an even larger laugh.",

      "content": "Over many scotches with him one evening in Chicago, I was surprised\n\nto learn that much of his demeanor is a carefully crafted persona. While he’s\n\noutwardly very loud and outspoken, he’s actually an introvert by nature,\n\nvery analytic and passionate about sales discipline. Hearing him chastise yet\n\nanother person on the phone, I think about how odd it is that even a\n\ndiscipline like sales, known for its chaotic and unpredictable nature, is more\n\npredictable than IT.\n\nThere’s at least a predictable funnel that comes from marketing\n\ncampaigns, generating prospects, leads, qualified leads, and sales\n\nopportunities that leads to a sales pipeline. One sales person missing their\n\nnumber rarely jeopardizes the entire department.\n\nOn the other hand, any of my engineers can get me fired by making a\n\nseemingly small, harmless change that results in a crippling, enterprise-\n\nwide outage.\n\nRon slams down the phone. “Sorry, guys. Despite all the training I do,\n\nsometimes my team behaves like a bunch of wild animals,” he says, still\n\nexasperated. He rips the stapled document he’s holding in two, and then\n\ntosses it into his trash can.\n\n“Jesus Christ, Ron,” I can’t help but say. “Your recycling bin is right\n\nnext to you!”\n\n“I’ll be dead long before the landfills are full!” he says with a large\n\nlaugh.\n\nHe may be dead soon, but my kids won’t be. As I explain to him why\n\nwe’re here, I reach under the desk to grab the papers from the wastebasket,\n\nputting them in the recycling bin. “You’re listed as the owner of the ‘sales\n\npipeline’ and ‘sales forecast accuracy’ measures on Dick’s spreadsheet.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the challenges of hitting those numbers?”\n\n“Look, I don’t know much about IT. Someone on my staff might be\n\nbetter for you to talk to,” he responds.\n\n“Don’t worry, I’m not asking about anything IT-related. Let’s just talk\n\nabout your measures,” I assure him.\n\n“Okay, it’s your nickel…” he says. “If you want to talk about sales\n\nforecast accuracy, you first need to know why it’s so inaccurate. It starts\n\nwhen Steve and Dick hand me a crazy revenue target, leaving me to figure\n\nout how to deliver on it. For years, I’ve had to assign way too much quota\n\ncapacity to my team, so of course we keep missing our numbers! I tell Steve\n\nand Dick this, year after year, but they don’t listen. Probably because\n\nthey’re having some arbitrary revenue target jammed down their throats by\n\nthe board.\n\n“It’s a crappy way to run a company. It demoralizes my team, and my\n\ntop performers are quitting in droves. Of course, we’ll replace them, but it\n\ntakes at least a year for replacements to perform at full quota capacity. Even\n\nin this lousy economy, it takes too long to find qualified sales people.\n\n“You know what chaps my hide?” he continues. “Sarah promised that\n\nacquiring the retail stores would accelerate our sales. And has it happened?\n\nHell, no!\n\n“We’re completely screwing up the execution. This morning, a district\n\nmanager was screaming that they need truckloads of our new fuel injector\n\nkits because all his stores are completely stocked out. We’re losing the\n\neasiest sales we can make! Our customers want to buy, but they’re walking\n\nout empty-handed, probably buying something crappier from one of our\n\ncompetitors.”\n\nRon says angrily, “We are clueless about what our customers want! We\n\nhave too much product that will never sell and never enough of the ones\n\nthat do.”\n\nHis words sounding familiar, I look down at Dick’s slide again. “You’re\n\nsaying that ‘sales forecast accuracy’ is being jeopardized by our poor grasp\n\nof ‘understanding our customer needs and wants?’ And that if we know\n\nwhat products were out of stock in the stores, we could increase sales?”\n\n“Damned right,” he says. “With the traffic we get in the stores, that’s the\n\nfastest and easiest way to increase revenue. It’s a lot easier than dealing\n\nwith the fickle whims of our large automotive buyers, that’s for sure.”\n\nI make a note to myself to find out how stockout data are generated, and\n\nI see Patty furiously taking notes as well.\n\nI ask Ron about the sales pipeline process and its challenges, and I get\n\nan earful. He tells us at length how difficult it is for his managers to get the\n\nreports they need out of our customer relationship management system\n\n(CRM) and the endless battle to make sure his entire sales force uses it in\n\ntheir daily work.\n\nBut the floodgates really open when I ask him what a bad day for him\n\nlooks like.\n\n“A bad day?” he repeats, staring at me disapprovingly. “Why, Bill, it’s\n\npositively catastrophic when the MRP and phone systems that you manage\n\ngo down like they did a few weeks ago. For just the MRP outage, we had\n\ncustomers screaming about delayed orders, and two of them canceled a\n\nquarter-million dollars of orders outright. We’re scrambling to keep some of\n\nour best customers from putting $1.5 million of contracts up for rebid.”\n\nHe leans across his desk. “And when the phones went down in the last\n\nfew days of the quarter, and customers couldn’t give us orders or make last-\n\nminute changes! That’s delayed another $1.5 million of orders, and ten\n\ncustomers are reevaluating their contracts, putting another $5 million of\n\ncontracts at risk.”\n\n“You’re making my job much, much harder, pal,” he says. “A lot of my\n\nsales people missed their quota by the tiniest fractions, due to things totally\n\noutside of their control. To keep morale up, I’m demanding Steve give\n\nquota credit for any order that was delayed because of our screwups.”\n\nI grimace. Steve’s going to love that idea as much as he loved Sarah\n\ngiving away vouchers to disgruntled Phoenix customers.\n\n“I’m really sorry that happened on my watch. There’s no excuse for it,”\n\nI say sincerely. I tell him what happened with the vendor making the\n\nunauthorized change to the phone switch, and the steps we’re taking to\n\nensure that it doesn’t happen again.\n\nI explain, “We have change control policies, but as you know, training\n\nand trust only go so far—at some point, we need monitoring to enforce\n\nthose policies. The trouble is, we need to expand the licensing beyond what\n\nInformation Security has deployed, and emergency capital is hard to get\n\nthese days. Especially for IT Operations.”\n\nRon turns bright red. “Why? What are they saving it for? Probably\n\nanother goddamned acquisition that Sarah is dreaming up.” He laughs\n\nhumorlessly. “How much money are we talking about?”\n\nWhen I tell him, he looks disgusted. “We spend more money watering\n\nthe damned lawns at the manufacturing plants every week! Dick is going to\n\nhear from me about this. If he’s not willing to spend money, we may lose\n\norders—even if your project is just insurance so we can collect on all the\n\nhard work my sales team does—it’s a goddamned no-brainer!”\n\n“We sure think so. Thanks for the support,” I say. “We’re about out of\n\ntime. Are there any other challenges or impediments that we can help\n\nwith?”\n\nHe looks at his watch for a moment. “No, just keep those damned\n\nvendors from crashing our phone systems again, you hear?”\n\nPatty looks invigorated as she flips through all her notes by the elevator\n\nbanks. She says, “Ron mentioned how critical the phones and the MRP\n\nsystems are, but I’m sure there’s more, like the inventory management\n\nsystems. I’ll work on creating the complete list of applications and\n\ninfrastructure that support Ron. If any of them are fragile, we need to get\n\nthem added to our replacement list. This is a great opportunity to be\n\nproactive.”\n\n“You read my mind,” I say, smiling. “That preventive work supports the\n\nmost important objectives of the company. How do we know? We started\n\nfrom the measures that Dick cares about most.”\n\nI’m pleased. Now I’m really looking forward to our next interview,\n\nwhich is with Maggie Lee, who sponsored Phoenix.\n\nPatty and I meet with Maggie on the following Monday. Over the\n\nweekend, Sarah e-mailed me, demanding to know the agenda for the\n\nmeeting, threatening to cancel it. When I start copying Dick and Steve on\n\nmy replies, she relents, but warns me not to meddle with her department.\n\nI’m not worried. Both Patty and I work with Maggie regularly. She’s the\n\nbusiness sponsor of over half the IT projects. Among other things, Maggie is\n\nresponsible for making sure that the company has the best possible\n\nassortment of merchandise in each of our stores, and she owns the category\n\nand pricing roadmaps.\n\nIn describing her responsibilities, she summarizes, “Ultimately, the way\n\nI measure our understanding of customer needs and wants is whether\n\ncustomers would recommend us to their friends. Any way you cut it, our\n\nmetrics aren’t very good.”\n\nWhen I ask why, she sighs. “Most of the time, we’re flying blind.\n\nIdeally, our sales data would tell us what customers want. You’d think that\n\nwith all the data in our order entry and inventory management systems, we\n\ncould do this. But we can’t, because the data are almost always wrong.”\n\nPatty glances my way meaningfully as Maggie continues, “Our data\n\nquality is so bad that we can’t rely on it to do any sort of forecasting. The\n\nbest data that we have right now come from interviewing our store\n\nmanagers every two months and the customer focus groups we do twice a\n\nyear. You can’t run a billion-dollar business this way and expect to succeed!\n\n“At my last job, we received sales and stockout reports every day,” she\n\ncontinues. “Here, we get them once a month from Finance, but they’re full\n\nof errors. What do you expect? They’re done by a bunch of college interns,\n\ncopying and pasting numbers between a million spreadsheets.”\n\n“If you could wave a magic wand, what would you do instead?” I ask.\n\n“How big of a magic wand?” she asks.\n\n“It can do anything you want,” I reply, smiling.\n\n“That’s a big magic wand,” she says, laughing. “I want accurate and\n\ntimely order information from our stores and online channels. I want to\n\npress a button and get it, instead of running it through the circus we’ve\n\ncreated. I’d use that data to create marketing campaigns that continually do\n\nA/B testing of offers, finding the ones that our customers jump at. When we\n\nfind out what works, we’d replicate it across our entire customer list. By\n\ndoing this, we’d be creating a huge and predictable sales funnel for Ron.\n\n“I’d use that information to drive our production schedule, so we can\n\nmanage our supply and demand curves. We’d keep the right products on the\n\nright store shelves and keep them stocked. Our revenue per customer would\n\ngo through the roof. Our average order sizes would go up. We’d finally\n\nincrease our market share and start beating the competition again.”\n\nAs she’s telling us this, she looks animated and excited. Then her\n\nexuberance disappears. Sounding defeated, she says, “But we’re stuck with\n\nthe systems we have, unfortunately.”\n\n“Wait a second. I thought Phoenix was supposed to fix all this?” I ask.\n\nShe snorts in disgust. “All we’ve gotten from Phoenix is a bunch of\n\npromises. It was supposed to do a lot of this reporting, but there’s so much\n\npolitical pressure to ship something, they keep dropping features. And guess\n\nwhich feature they’re delaying until sometime next year?” She rolls her\n\neyes in disbelief.\n\n“Reporting?” I guess, fearing the worst.\n\nWhen Maggie nods, I try to stay upbeat. “For now, let’s assume that the\n\nmagic wand worked. We now have great data coming out of the stores.\n\nYou’re keeping the right products in the stores, and the campaigns you’re\n\ndreaming up are succeeding beyond your wildest dreams. What then?”\n\n“Life gets exciting, that’s what!” she says, her eyes lighting up. “Last\n\nyear, we shipped a custom fuel injection system for a new upcoming sports\n\ncar. We had just six months to get this to market, from the drawing board to\n\nthe shelves. We nailed it! The designers, R&D folks, and Marketing all\n\nkicked ass. We had the right product, right place, right brand, right price,\n\nand right quality. It was one of the best-selling products of the year.\n\n“We took a risk and won big,” she says. “If we had better visibility into\n\nour retail operations, with our amazing R&D and manufacturing capabilities,\n\nwe could make fifty of those bets per year. I’d bet four of those would be\n\nrunaway hits! We’d not only be profitable, we’d be insanely profitable.”\n\nPatty interjects, “What’s an acceptable time to market for your\n\nproducts?”\n\nShe responds quickly, “These days? Products need to ship in six months.\n\nNine months, tops. Otherwise, some Chinese company will steal our idea,\n\nhave them on our competitors store shelves, and take the majority of the\n\nmarket.\n\n“In these competitive times, the name of the game is quick time to\n\nmarket and to fail fast. We just can’t have multiyear product development\n\ntimelines, waiting until the end to figure out whether we have a winner or\n\nloser on our hands. We need short and quick cycle times to continually\n\nintegrate feedback from the marketplace.\n\n“But that’s just half the picture,” she continues. “The longer the product\n\ndevelopment cycle, the longer the company capital is locked up and not\n\ngiving us a return. Dick expects that on average, our R&D investments return\n\nmore than ten percent. That’s the internal hurdle rate. If we don’t beat the\n\nhurdle rate, the company capital would have been better spent being\n\ninvested in the stock market or gambled on racehorses.\n\n“When R&D capital is locked up as WIP for more than a year, not\n\nreturning cash back to the business, it becomes almost impossible to pay\n\nback the business,” she continues.\n\nHoly crap. Maggie is starting to sound eerily like Erik, too. The need to\n\ncontinually reduce cycle times is part of the First Way. The need for\n\namplification of feedback loops, ideally from the customer, is part of the\n\nSecond Way.\n\nBut nine months to return cash back to the company, tops? We’ve been\n\nat Phoenix for nearly three years and it still hasn’t created the desired\n\nbusiness value.\n\nI have a terrible feeling that we may be going about Phoenix entirely the\n\nwrong way…\n\nLooking at my watch, I see that we’re almost out of time. Putting the\n\nthoughts of Phoenix aside, I ask Maggie about other ways that IT is\n\nimpeding the achievement of her goals.\n\nHer expression darkens. “Well, there is one more thing…”\n\nMaggie then describes the intense competition for IT project resources.\n\n“Our planning horizon is six to twelve months. How does anyone know\n\nwhat projects they should be working on three years from now?” she says\n\nangrily, suddenly reminding me of Ron.\n\nNothing unifies people better than complaining about IT.\n\n“I completely understand your frustration,” I say stoically. “You have\n\nany ideas on how to fix it?”\n\nShe shares a bunch of ideas about hiring more IT people, dedicating IT\n\npeople to her group, putting more scrutiny on the projects that are clogging\n\nthe IT project queue, and so forth.\n\nMost of the ideas aren’t new, and I merely raise my eyebrows at the\n\nnotion of a larger IT budget. Steve and Dick will never go for that.\n\n“Incredible!” Patty exclaims, as we leave Maggie’s office. “I can’t believe\n\nhow frustrated Maggie and Ron are. Can you believe that unreliable data in\n\nthe order entry and inventory management systems came up again? And I\n\ncan’t believe that Phoenix, as it’s currently designed, won’t actually fix the\n\ndata quality problems!”\n\nI nod and say decisively, “Get a meeting together with John and Wes.\n\nWe’ll show them what we’ve learned so far. Invite Chris, as well. This goes\n\nbeyond just IT Operations. This may change how we prioritize and develop\n\nour applications, too.”\n\nAs she leaves, I look at my Phoenix calculations again.\n\nWe’ve spent over $20 million on Phoenix over three years. With all that\n\nWIP and capital locked inside the project, it will likely never clear the ten\n\npercent internal hurdle rate. In other words, Phoenix should not have been\n\napproved.\n\nChapter 27 • Tuesday, October 21\n\nI’m in a conference room with Patty, Wes, Chris, and John to share the\n\nprogress Patty and I have made.\n\nI begin by stating, “We interviewed Ron and Maggie, the business\n\nprocess owners on Dick’s company measurements slide. I’ve spent some\n\ntime thinking about what we’ve learned.”\n\nI dig out my notes and walk to the whiteboard, writing out, “Parts\n\nUnlimited desired business outcomes: increase revenue, increase market\n\nshare, increase average order size, restore profitability, increase return on\n\nassets.”\n\nThen I draw the following table:\n\nPerformance Measures\n\nArea of IT Reliance\n\nBusiness Risk Due to IT\n\nIT Controls Relied Upon\n\n1.

Wes says, “Jesus Christ. I’m not the smartest guy in\n\nthe room by any stretch. But, if we’re so important, why are they trying to\n\noutsource all of us? Face it, we’ve been moved from one foster home to\n\nanother for decades.”\n\nNone of us have a good answer.\n\n“You know, I really like Bill’s third column: ‘business risk due to IT,’”\n\nJohn says. “By describing what could go wrong in IT that prevents the\n\nbusiness outcome from being achieved, we’re helping the business process\n\nowners get their bonuses. This should be very persuasive. We may even be\n\nthanked by the business for doing all this work, which would be a refreshing\n\nchange.”\n\n“I agree. Nice job, Bill,” Chris says, finally. “But what’s the solution?”\n\nI say, “Anyone have any ideas?”\n\nSurprisingly, John speaks up first. “Seems pretty obvious to me. We need\n\nto come with the controls to mitigate the risks in your third column. We then\n\nshow this table to Ron and Maggie, and make sure they believe that our\n\ncountermeasures help them achieve their objectives. If they buy it, we work\n\nwith them to integrate IT into their performance measures…\n\n“That example Erik gave you is perfect. They integrated ‘compliance\n\nwith vehicle maintenance procedures’ as a leading indicator for ‘on-time\n\ndelivery’ and ‘customer retention.’ We need to do the same.”\n\nWe roll up our sleeves and get to work.\n\nFor the phone and MRP systems, we quickly establish that the predictive\n\nmeasures include compliance with the change management process,\n\nsupervision and review of production changes, completion of scheduled\n\nmaintenance, and elimination of all known single points of failure.\n\nWhen we tackle ‘customer needs and wants,” we get stuck.\n\nIt’s John who gets us rolling again. “Here, the objective isn’t system\n\navailability, it’s the integrity of data, which, incidentally, form two of the\n\nthree legs of the ‘confidentiality, integrity, and availability triangle’ or CIA.”\n\nHe asks Chris, “So, what’s causing the data integrity issues?”\n\nChris snorts in disgust. “Phoenix fixes a bunch of them, but we still have\n\nissues. Most of them are caused upstream, because the Marketing people\n\nkeep putting in malformed inventory SKUs. Marketing needs to get their crap\n\ntogether, too.”\n\nSo for ‘marketing needs and wants,’ our proposed measurements include\n\nability for Phoenix to support weekly and eventually daily reporting,\n\npercentage of valid SKUs created by Marketing, and so forth.\n\nBy the end of the day, we’ve generated a slide deck that Patty and I will\n\ntake back to Ron and Maggie, which we’ll then present to Dick.\n\n“Now that, my friends, is a solid proposal,” Wes says, proudly. With a\n\nloud laugh, he says, “Even a monkey could follow the dots we just\n\nconnected!”\n\nOver the next day, Patty and I get great feedback from Ron and Maggie,\n\nand they commit to supporting our proposal with Dick. When Ron learns\n\nthat we still haven’t been granted budget for our monitoring project, he calls\n\nup Dick right in front of us, leaving him a heated voicemail, demanding to\n\nknow why he’s dragging his feet.\n\nWith all this enthusiastic support, I figure our Thursday meeting with\n\nDick will be a slam dunk.\n\n“All you’ve told me is that you’re completely asleep at the wheel!” Dick says\n\nsternly, obviously unimpressed by what I’ve presented. Suddenly, I’m\n\nreminded of how Steve didn’t even look at the spreadsheets I had prepared\n\nfor him when I asked him to prioritize Phoenix and the audit finding work.\n\nBut Dick isn’t being dismissive. He’s actually angry. “You’re telling me\n\nsomething a nutless monkey could have figured out. You didn’t know these\n\nmeasurements were important? At every town hall meeting, Steve repeats\n\nthem over and over. It’s in our company newsletters, it’s what Sarah talks\n\nabout in every one of her strategy briefings. How could you all miss\n\nsomething so important?”\n\nI see Chris and Patty fidget on either side of me as we sit across the table\n\nfrom Dick. Erik is standing by the window, leaning against the wall.\n\nI have a flashback to when I was Marine sergeant, holding the flag on\n\nparade. Out of nowhere, a colonel appeared, growling at me in front of my\n\nentire unit, “That’s an out of regulation watch band, Sergeant Palmer!” I\n\ncould have died on the spot from embarrassment, because I knew I had\n\nscrewed up.\n\nBut today, I’m certain I understand the mission, and for the company to\n\nsucceed I need Dick to understand what I’ve just learned. But how?\n\nErik clears his throat, and says to Dick, “I agree a nutless monkey should\n\nhave figured this out. So, Dick, explain why on that little measurement\n\nspreadsheet of yours, you list four levels of management for each of your\n\nmeasurements but nowhere are there any IT managers listed. Why?”\n\nNot waiting for Dick to respond, he continues, “Every week, IT people\n\nget dragged into fire drills at the last minute by managers trying to achieve\n\nthose measurements—just like Brent was pulled in to help launch Sarah’s\n\nlatest sales promotion.” Erik pauses and says, “Quite frankly, I think you’re\n\njust as much of a nutless monkey as Bill.”\n\nDick grunts but doesn’t seem perturbed. He finally says, “Maybe so,\n\nErik. You know, five years ago, we used to have our CIO attend our quarterly\n\nbusiness reviews, but he never opened his mouth except to tell us that\n\neverything we proposed was impossible. After a year of that, Steve stopped\n\ninviting him.”\n\nDick turns back to me. “Bill, you’re telling me that everyone could do\n\neverything right in the business, but because of these IT issues, we would all\n\nstill miss these objectives?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” I say. “The operational risks posed by IT need to be managed\n\njust like any other business risk. In other words, they’re not IT risks. They’re\n\nbusiness risks.”\n\nAgain, Dick grunts. He slumps in his chair, rubbing his eyes. “Shit. How\n\nthe hell are we supposed to write an IT outsourcing contract if we don’t even\n\nknow what the business needs? Goddamnit!” he says, slamming his hand on\n\nthe table.\n\nHe then asks, “Well, what’s your proposal? You’ve got one, I presume?”\n\nI sit upright and begin the pitch that I’ve rehearsed so many times with\n\nthe team. “I’d like three weeks with each of the business process owners on\n\nthat spreadsheet. We need to get the business risks posed by IT better defined\n\nand agreed upon and then propose to you a way to integrate those risks into\n\nleading indicators of performance. Our goal is not just to improve business\n\nperformance but to get earlier indicators of whether we’re going to achieve\n\nthem or not, so we can take appropriate action.\n\n“Furthermore,” I continue. “I’d like to schedule a single topic meeting\n\nwith you and Chris about Phoenix,” then explaining my concerns how\n\nPhoenix as defined should not even have been approved.\n\nI continue, “We’re going way too slowly, with too much WIP and too\n\nmany features in flight. We need to make our releases smaller and shorter\n\nand deliver cash back faster, so we can beat the internal hurdle rate. Chris\n\nand I have some ideas, but it will look very different than our current plan of\n\nrecord.”\n\nHe remains silent. Then decisively, he declares, “Yes on both of your\n\nproposals. I’ll assign Ann to help. You need the best talent in the company.”\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I see Chris and Patty smile.\n\n“Thank you, sir. We’ll make it so,” I say, standing up and pushing\n\neveryone out of the room, before Dick changes his mind.\n\nAs we walk out of his office, Erik claps his hand on my shoulder. “Not\n\nbad, kid. Congratulations on being well on your way to mastering the First\n\nWay. Now help John get there, because you’re going to have your hands full\n\ntackling the Second Way.”\n\nConfused, I ask, “Why? What’s going to happen?”\n\n“You’ll find out soon enough,” Erik says with a chuckle.\n\nOn Friday, John convenes a meeting with Wes, Patty, and me, promising\n\nsome fantastic news. He says effusively, “You guys did fantastic work\n\nlinking IT to Dick’s operational objectives. I’ve finally learned how we\n\ndodged the audit bullet, and I’m pretty sure we can do something equally\n\nfantastic to reduce our audit and compliance workload.”\n\n“Doing less audit work?” Wes says, looking up, putting his phone down.\n\n“I’m all ears!”\n\nHe has my attention, too. If there were some way to get audit off our\n\nbacks without another Bataan Death March, it would be nothing short of a\n\nmiracle.\n\nHe turns toward Wes and Patty. “I needed to figure out how we escaped\n\nall the findings from the internal and external auditors. At first, I thought it\n\nwas just the audit partner bending over backward to retain us as a client. But\n\nthat wasn’t it at all…\n\n“I got in front of everyone from the Parts Unlimited team who was at that\n\nmeeting, trying to figure out who had the magic bullet. To my surprise, it\n\nwasn’t Dick or our corporate counsel. Ten meetings later, I finally found\n\nFaye, a Financial Analyst who works for Ann in Finance.\n\n“Faye has a technical background. She spent four years in IT,” he says, as\n\nhe hands out papers to each of us. “She created these SOX-404 control\n\ndocuments for the finance team. It shows the end-to-end information flow\n\nfor the main business processes in each financially significant account. She\n\ndocumented where money or assets entered the system and traced it all the\n\nway to the general ledger.\n\n“This is pretty standard, but she took it one step further: She didn’t look\n\nat any of the IT systems until she understood exactly where in the process\n\nmaterial errors could occur and where they would be detected. She found\n\nthat most of the time, we would detect it in a manual reconciliation step\n\nwhere account balances and values from one source were compared to\n\nanother, usually on a weekly basis.\n\n“When this happens,” he says, with awe and wonder in his voice, “she\n\nknew the upstream IT systems should be out of scope of the audit.”\n\n“Here’s what she showed the auditors,” John says, excitedly flipping to\n\nthe second page. “Quote: ‘The control being relied upon to detect material\n\nerrors is the manual reconciliation step, not in the upstream IT systems.’ I\n\nwent through all of Faye’s papers, and in every case, the auditors agreed,\n\nwithdrawing their IT finding.\n\n“That’s why Erik called the pile of audit findings a ‘scoping error.’ He’s\n\nright. If the audit test plan was scoped correctly in the beginning, there\n\nwouldn’t have been any IT findings!” he concludes.\n\nJohn looks around as Patty, Wes, and I stare blankly at him.\n\nI say, “I’m not following. How does this relate to reducing the audit\n\nworkload?”\n\n“I’m rebuilding our compliance program from scratch, based upon our\n\nnew understanding of precisely where we’re relying our controls,” John\n\nsays. “That dictates what matters. It’s like having a magic set of glasses that\n\ncan differentiate what controls are earth-shatteringly important versus those\n\nthat have no value at all.”\n\n“Yes!” I say. “Those ‘magic glasses’ helped us finally see what matters to\n\nDick for company operations. It was right in front of us for years, but we\n\nnever saw it.”\n\nJohn nods and smiles broadly. He flips to the last page of the handout.\n\n“I’m proposing five things that could reduce our security-related workload\n\nby seventy-five percent.”\n\nWhat he presents is breathtaking. His first proposal drastically reduces\n\nthe scope of the SOX-404 compliance program. When he verbalizes so\n\nprecisely why it’s safe to do, I realize that John too is also mastering the First\n\nWay, having truly achieved a “profound appreciation of the system.”\n\nHis second proposal requires that we find out how production\n\nvulnerabilities got there in the first place and that we ensure that they don’t\n\nhappen again by modifying our deployment processes.\n\nHis third proposal requires that we flag all the systems in the scope for\n\ncompliance audits in Patty’s change management process—so we can avoid\n\nchanges that could jeopardize our audits—and that we create the on-going\n\ndocumentation that the auditors will ask for.\n\nJohn looks around, seeing all of us staring at him in shocked silence.\n\n“Did I say something wrong?”\n\n“No offense, John…” Wes says slowly. “But…uh… You feeling okay?”\n\nI say, “John, I don’t think you’ll get any objections from my team on\n\nyour proposals. I think they’re great ideas.” Wes and Patty vehemently nod\n\nin agreement.\n\nLooking pleased, he continues, “My fourth proposal is to reduce the size\n\nof our PCI compliance program by getting rid of anything that stores or\n\nprocesses cardholder data, which is like toxic waste. Losing or mishandling\n\nit can be lethal, and it costs too much to protect.\n\n“Let’s start with the goddamned cafeteria point of sale system. I never\n\nwant to do another security review of that piece of crap. Frankly, I don’t care\n\nwho takes it, even if it’s Sarah’s cousin Vinnie. It’s gotta go.”\n\nPatty has one hand covering her mouth, and even Wes’ jaw is on the\n\ntable. Has John completely lost his mind? This proposal seems…potentially\n\nreckless.\n\nWes thinks for a moment, and changes his mind. “I love it! I wish we\n\ncould have gotten rid of it years ago. We’ve spent months securing that\n\nsystem for those audits. It even went into scope for the SOX-404 audits\n\nbecause it talked to the payroll systems!”\n\nPatty eventually nods. “I suppose no one would argue that the cafeteria\n\nPOS is a core competency. It doesn’t help our business but can definitely hurt\n\nit. And it pulls scarce resources from Phoenix and our in-store POS systems,\n\nwhich are definitely part of our core competencies.”\n\n“Okay, John, let’s do it. You’re batting four out of four,” I say, decisively.\n\n“But do you really think we can get rid of it in time to make a difference?”\n\n“Yep,” John says, smiling confidently. “I’ve already talked with Dick and\n\nthe legal team. We just need to find a suitable outsourcer and convince\n\nourselves that they can be trusted to maintain and secure the systems and\n\ndata. We can outsource the work but not the responsibility.”\n\nWes interjects hopefully, “Can you do something about getting Phoenix\n\nout of scope of the audits, too?”\n\n“Over my dead body,” John says flatly, crossing his arms. “My fifth and\n\nlast proposal is that we pay down all the technical debt in Phoenix, using all\n\nthe time we’ve saved from my previous proposals. We know there’s a huge\n\namount of risk in Phoenix: strategic risk, operational risk, huge security and\n\ncompliance risk. Almost all of Dick’s key measures hinge on it.\n\n“As Patty said, our order entry and inventory management systems are a\n\ncore competency. We’re relying on it to give us a competitive edge, but with\n\nall the shortcuts we’ve taken with it, it’s like a powder keg waiting to blow\n\nup.”\n\nWes sighs, looking annoyed. Bad old John is back, his expression says.\n\nI disagree. This John is far more complex and nuanced than the old John.\n\nIn the span of a couple of minutes, he’s been willing to take bigger, almost\n\nreckless, risks from outsourcing our cafeteria POS systems to his unyielding\n\nand categorical insistence that we secure and harden Phoenix.\n\nI like this new John.\n\n“You’re absolutely right, John. We’ve got to pay down technical debt,” I\n\nsay firmly. “How do you propose we do it?”\n\nWe quickly agree to pair up people in Wes’ and Chris’ group with John’s\n\nteam, so that we can increase the bench of security expertise. By doing this,\n\nwe will start integrating security into all of our daily work, no longer\n\nsecuring things after they’re deployed.\n\nJohn thanks everyone, indicating that we’ve covered everything on his\n\nagenda. I look at my watch. We’re done thirty minutes early. This must be a\n\nnew world record for the shortest time required to agree on anything\n\nsecurity-related.\n\nChapter 28 • Monday, October 27\n\nOn my drive into work, I have to turn on my seat heaters months earlier than\n\nusual.\n\nI hope this winter won’t be as awful as last year. Paige’s relatives, the\n\nmost skeptical people I’ve ever met, have started wondering whether there\n\nactually might be something to this global climate change thing, after all.\n\nWhen I get to my office, I take my laptop out of my bag, smiling at how\n\nquickly it powers on. As I write up a report for Steve on how far we’ve\n\ncome in the last six weeks, I don’t put in anything about my new laptop, but\n\nI want to.\n\nTo me, the laptop represents everything my team has achieved together.\n\nI’m incredibly proud of them. Life feels different now. The number of Sev 1\n\noutages this month is down by more than two-thirds. Incident recovery time\n\nis down, too, probably by more than half.\n\nThe insight we’ve gained from that first strange meeting with Dick and\n\nJohn tells me that we’re hot on the trail of understanding how we can really\n\nhelp the business win.\n\nOpening up my e-mail, I see a note from Kirsten. All her project\n\nmanagers are gushing about how projects are flowing so much faster. The\n\nnumber of tasks waiting for Brent and the rest of IT Operations is way\n\ndown. In fact, if I’m reading the report correctly, Brent is almost caught up.\n\nOn the project front, we’re in fantastic shape—especially with Phoenix.\n\nThere’s another Phoenix deployment scheduled for Friday. It’s only a\n\nbunch of defect fixes, with no major functionality added or changed, so it",

We’ve completed all of our\n\ndeliverables on time, but as usual, there are still a million details that still\n\nneed to be worked out.\n\nI’m grateful that my team can stay so focused on Phoenix, because\n\nwe’ve stabilized our infrastructure. When the inevitable outages and\n\nincidents do occur, we’re operating like a well-oiled machine. We’re\n\nbuilding a body of tribal knowledge that’s helping us fix things faster than\n\never, and, when we do need to escalate, it’s controlled and orderly.\n\nBecause of our ever-improving production monitoring of the\n\ninfrastructure and applications, more often than not, we know about the\n\nincidents before the business does.\n\nOur project backlog has been cut way down, partially from eradicating\n\ndumb projects from our queue. And John has delivered. We’ve cut a bunch\n\nof unneeded security projects from our audit preparation and remediation\n\nwork, replacing them with preventive security projects that my entire team\n\nis helping with. By modifying our development and deployment processes,\n\nwe’re hardening and securing both the applications and production\n\ninfrastructure in a meaningful and systematic way. And we’re gaining\n\nconfidence that those defects will never happen again in the future.\n\nOur change management meetings are going more smoothly and\n\nregularly than ever. We not only have visibility into what our teams are\n\ndoing, but work is really flowing.\n\nMore than ever, people know exactly what they should be working on.\n\nPeople are getting satisfaction out of fixing things. I’m hearing that people\n\nare feeling happier and more upbeat, because they can actually do their\n\njobs.\n\nIt’s strange how much more clearly I see the IT world now and how\n\ndifferently it looks to me than even a couple of months ago.\n\nPatty’s experiments with establishing kanbans around Brent are a\n\nsuccess. We’re also finding instances of work going backward to Brent,\n\nbecause we didn’t understand or didn’t sufficiently specify some task or\n\noutcome, requiring Brent to translate or fix it.\n\nWhen this happens now, we quickly jump on it to make sure that it\n\ndoesn’t happen again.\n\nAnd it’s not just Brent’s work that we’re improving. By reducing the\n\nnumber of projects in flight, we’re keeping clear lanes of work, so work can\n\ngo from one work center to the other quickly, getting completed in record\n\ntime.\n\nWe’ve all but emptied our ticketing system of outdated work. In one\n\ncase, we even found a ticket that Wes put in over ten years ago as a junior\n\nengineer, referring to some task for a machine that has been long since\n\ndecommissioned. Now we have confidence that all work in the system is\n\nimportant and actually has a prayer of being completed.\n\nWe are no longer the Bates Motel of work.\n\nAgainst my staff’s expectations, we keep bumping up the number of\n\nprojects we think we can handle concurrently. Because we have a better\n\nidea of what our flows of work are, and managing carefully which ones are\n\nallowed to go to Brent, we’re finding that we can keep releasing more\n\nprojects without impacting our existing commitments.\n\nI no longer think of Erik as a raving madman, but he’s eccentric, for\n\nsure. Now that I’ve seen the results with my own eyes in my own\n\norganization, I know that IT Operations work is very similar to plant work.\n\nErik has stated repeatedly that our improvements to date are only the tip of\n\nthe iceberg.\n\nErik says that we are starting to master the First Way: We’re curbing the\n\nhandoffs of defects to downstream work centers, managing the flow of\n\nwork, setting the tempo by our constraints, and, based on our results from\n\naudit and from Dick, we’re understanding better than we ever have what is\n\nimportant versus what is not.\n\nAt the end, I led the retrospective portion, where we self-assessed how\n\nwe did and the areas that we should improve. When someone mentioned\n\nthat we should start inviting people from Development when we do our\n\noutage postmortem root cause analysis meetings, I realized that we are now\n\nalso well on our way to understanding Erik’s Third Way, as well.\n\nAs Erik keeps reminding me, a great team performs best when they\n\npractice. Practice creates habits, and habits create mastery of any process or\n\nskill. Whether it’s calisthenics, sports training, playing a musical\n\ninstrument, or in my experience, the endless drilling we did in the Marines.\n\nRepetition, especially for things that require teamwork, creates trust and\n\ntransparency.\n\nLast week, as I sat through our latest biweekly outage drill, I was very\n\nimpressed. We were getting very good at this.\n\nI feel certain that if the payroll failure that happened on my first day of\n\nthe job happened now, we could complete the entire payroll run—not just\n\nthe salaried staff, but the hourly staff, as well.\n\nJohn quickly got the approval from Dick and Steve to have an\n\noutsourcer to take over the cafeteria POS systems and replace it with\n\nsomething commercially supported.\n\nIt was a fascinating exercise for Wes, Patty, and me to work with John to\n\nput together the outsourcing requirements for the cafeteria POS systems. As\n\npart of the due diligence process, we were going to hear from all the\n\nprospective outsourcers all the dogmas we used to believe before all our\n\ninteractions with Erik. It will be interesting to see if we can retrain them.\n\nIt seems to me that if anyone is managing IT without talking about the\n\nThree Ways, they are managing IT on dangerously faulty assumptions.\n\nAs I’m pondering this, my phone rings. It’s John.\n\nWhen I answer, he says, “My team discovered something troubling\n\ntoday. To prevent unauthorized black market IT activities from cropping up,\n\nwe’ve started routinely reviewing all the proposed projects coming into\n\nKirsten’s Project Management Office. We also search all the corporate\n\ncredit cards for recurring charges that might be for online or cloud\n\nservices—which is just another form of unauthorized IT. Some people are\n\ngoing around the project freeze. You have time to talk?”\n\n“Let’s meet in ten minutes,” I say. “Don’t leave me hanging. Who’s\n\ntrying to backdoor the system?”\n\nI hear John laugh on the other end of the line. “Sarah. Who else?”\n\nI invite Wes and Patty to the impromptu meeting but only Patty can make it.\n\nJohn starts presenting what he found. Sarah’s group has four instances\n\nof using outside vendors and online services. Two are relatively innocuous\n\nbut the others are more serious: she has contracted a vendor for a $200,000\n\nproject to do customer data mining and another vendor to plug into all our\n\nPOS systems to get sales data for customer analytics.\n\n“The first problem is that both projects violate the data privacy policy\n\nthat we’ve given our customers,” John says. “We repeatedly promise that\n\nwe will not share data with partners. Whether we change that policy or not\n\nis, of course, a business decision. But make no mistake, if we go ahead with\n\nthe customer data mining initiative, we’re out of compliance with our own\n\nprivacy policy. We may even be breaking several state privacy regulations\n\nthat expose us to some liability.”\n\nThis doesn’t sound good, but John’s tone of voice suggests there’s worse\n\nto come. “The second problem is that Sarah’s vendor uses the same\n\ndatabase technology that we used for our cafeteria POS system, which we\n\nknow is virtually impossible to secure and maintain support for in\n\nproduction, if and when it becomes a part of daily operations.”\n\nI feel my face get red hot. It’s not just about another cafeteria POS system\n\nthat we’ll need to retrofit for production. It’s because applications like this\n\ncontribute to our inaccurate sales order entry and inventory management\n\ndata. We have too many cooks in the kitchen and no one accountable for\n\nmaintaining the integrity of the data.\n\n“Look, I don’t care about Sarah’s project management and invoicing\n\ntools—if it makes them more productive, let them use it,” I say. “It’s\n\nprobably safe as long as it doesn’t interface with an existing business\n\nsystem, store confidential data, affect financial reporting, or whatever. But\n\nif it does, then we need to be involved and at least confirm that it doesn’t\n\nimpact any of our existing commitments.”\n\n“I agree,” John says, “Want me to take the first stab at that outsourced IT\n\nservice policy document?”\n\n“Perfect,” I say. But with less certainty, I continue, “Although, what’s\n\nthe right way to handle Sarah? I feel completely out of my league. Steve\n\nconstantly protects her. How do we convey to him the potential mayhem\n\nshe’s causing with her unauthorized projects?”\n\nMaking sure John’s office door is closed, I say to John and Patty “Guys,\n\nhelp me out. What does Steve see in her? How does she get away with so\n\nmuch crap? Over the past couple of weeks, I see how hard-nosed Steve can\n\nbe, but Sarah routinely gets away with murder. Why?”\n\nPatty snorts. “If Steve were a woman, I’d say that he’s attracted to\n\ndangerous men. A bunch of us have speculated about this for years. I’ve had\n\na theory, which I must say, was pretty much validated in our last off-site.”\n\nWhen she sees John and me both conspiratorially leaning forward, she\n\nsmiles. “Steve prides himself on being an operations guy, and he’s admitted\n\nseveral times in company meetings that he doesn’t have a flair for strategy. I\n\nthink that’s why he loved working with his old boss and our new chairman\n\nBob so much. For a decade, Bob was the strategy guy, and all Steve had to\n\ndo was execute the vision.\n\n“For years, Steve searched for a strategy person to be his right-hand\n\nman. He went through quite a few people, even setting a couple executives\n\nagainst each other in this awful, drawn out competition. Pretty\n\nMachiavellian,” she continues. “And Sarah won. The word on the street was\n\nthat there was a lot of backstabbing and underhanded tactics, but I suppose\n\nthat’s what it takes to come out on top. Evidently, she has mastered how to\n\nwhisper the right things in his ear, reinforcing his paranoia and aspirations.”\n\nPatty’s explanation is so much more sophisticated than anything I’ve\n\ncome up with. In fact, it sounds strikingly similar to what Paige would\n\nspeculate when I got that distant, angry look at dinnertime.\n\nJohn says awkwardly, “Umm, you don’t think there’s anything between\n\nthem, do you? Like, anything…untoward?”\n\nI raise my eyebrows. I wondered about that, too.\n\nPatty just bursts out laughing. “I’m a pretty good judge of people. Both\n\nmy parents were psychologists. I’d eat both of their diplomas if that were\n\ntrue.”\n\nSeeing the expression on my face, she laughs even harder. “Look, not\n\neven Wes believes that, and there’s no one better at manufacturing drama\n\nthan him. Sarah’s scared to death of Steve! You ever notice that when\n\nsomeone is talking, Sarah is always still looking at Steve, trying to gauge\n\nhis reaction? It’s freakish, actually.”\n\nShe continues, “Steve has a blind spot for Sarah’s shortcomings,\n\nbecause she has something he needs and admires, which is the ability to\n\ncome up with creative strategies, regardless of whether the strategy is good\n\nor bad. On the other hand, because Sarah is so insecure, she’ll do whatever\n\nit takes to not look bad.\n\n“She simply doesn’t care about the body count she leaves in her wake,\n\nbecause she wants to be the next CEO of Parts Unlimited.” Patty says. “And\n\napparently, Steve does too. He’s been grooming her as his successor for\n\nyears.”\n\n“What? She could be our next CEO?” I exclaim in shock, quickly wiping\n\nup the coffee I spit out onto John’s conference table.\n\n“Wow, boss. You don’t hang out at the water cooler much, do you?”\n\nPatty says.\n\nIt’s Phoenix deployment day, and I’ve missed Halloween with my kids.\n\nIt’s already 11:40 p.m. As we’re standing once again around the NOC\n\nconference table, I have an unsettling feeling of déjà vu. I count fifteen\n\npeople here, including Chris and William.\n\nMost people are tensely huddled around the table with laptops open,\n\npizza boxes and candy wrappers piled behind them. Several other people\n\nare at the whiteboard, pointing at checklists or diagrams.\n\nIt took three hours longer than scheduled to migrate Phoenix into the QA\n\ntest environment and get all the tests to pass. Although this is much better\n\nthan the previous deployment, I thought we’d have fewer problems, given\n\nhow hard we worked on improving the deployment process,\n\nBy 9:30 p.m., we were finally ready to do the migration into production.\n\nAll the tests had finally passed, and Chris and William gave the thumbs-up\n\nto deploy. Wes, Patty, and I looked at the test reports, and gave the green\n\nlight to start the deployment work.\n\nThen all hell broke loose.\n\nOne of the critical database migration steps failed. We had only\n\ncompleted thirty percent of the deployment steps, and once again, we were\n\ndead in the water. Due to the database changes and the scripts already run, it\n\nwasn’t possible to roll back in the time remaining before the stores opened\n\ntomorrow morning.\n\nOnce again, we had to fight our way forward, trying to get to the next\n\nstep so the deployment could resume.\n\nLeaning against the wall, I watch everyone work, arms crossed, trying\n\nnot to pace. It’s frustrating that once again we are grappling with another\n\nPhoenix deployment going bad, with potentially disastrous outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, compared to last time, things are much calmer. While\n\nthere is tension, and a lot of heated arguments, everyone is intensely\n\nfocused on problem solving. We’ve already notified all the store managers\n\nabout our progress, and they all have manual fallback procedures ready, just\n\nin case the POS systems are down when the stores open.\n\nI see Wes say something to Brent, stand up to rub his forehead wearily,\n\nand then walk toward me. Chris and William also get up and follow him.\n\nI meet them halfway. “Well?” I ask.\n\n“Well,” Wes replies when he’s close enough to speak softly and be\n\nheard. “We’ve found our smoking gun. We just discovered that Brent made\n\na change to the production database a couple of weeks ago to support a\n\nPhoenix business intelligence module. No one knew about it, let alone\n\ndocumented it. It conflicts with some of the Phoenix database changes, so\n\nChris’ guys are going to need to do some recoding.”\n\n“Shit,” I say. “Wait. Which Phoenix module?”\n\n“It’s one of Sarah’s projects that we released after the project freeze was\n\nlifted,” he replies. “It was before we put the kanban around Brent. It was a\n\ndatabase schema change that slipped through the cracks.”\n\nI swear under my breath. Sarah again?\n\nChris has a pinched expression on his face. “This is going to be tricky.\n\nWe’re going to have to rename a bunch of database columns, which will\n\naffect, who knows, maybe hundreds of files. And all the support scripts.\n\nThis is going to be manual work and very error-prone.”\n\nHe turns to William. “What can we do to at least get some basic testing\n\nperformed before we continue the deployment?”\n\nWilliam looks vaguely ill, wiping sweat from his face with his hands.\n\n“This is very, very…dicey… We can test, but we still may not find the\n\nerrors until we hit those lines of code. That means we’re going to have\n\nfailures in production, where the application just blows up. It may even take\n\ndown the in-store POS systems, and that would be bad.”\n\nHe looks at his watch. “We’ve only got six hours to complete the work.\n\nBecause we don’t have enough time to rerun all the tests, we’re going to\n\nhave to take some shortcuts.”\n\nWe spend the next ten minutes sketching out a revised schedule that still\n\ncompletes by 6 a.m., enabling the stores to open normally with an hour to\n\nspare. As Chris and William head off to notify their teams, I indicate to Wes\n\nto remain behind.\n\n“When we’re out of the woods,” I say, “we’ve got to figure out how to\n\nprevent this from happening again. There should be absolutely no way that\n\nthe Dev and QA environments don’t match the production environment.”\n\n“You’re right,“ Wes says, shaking his head in disbelief. “I don’t know\n\nhow we’re going to do it. But you’ve got no argument from me.”\n\nHe looks behind him at Brent, incredulous. “Can you believe that Brent\n\nis at the center of all of this again?”\n\nMuch later, when the deployment is declared to be complete, everyone\n\napplauds. I look at my watch. It’s 5:42 a.m. on Saturday morning. The team\n\nspent the entire night working, completing the deployment twenty minutes\n\nearly. That is, twenty minutes early according to the emergency schedule we\n\nhammered out. According to the original schedule, we finished almost six\n\nhours late.\n\nWilliam has confirmed that the test POS systems are working, as well as\n\nthe e-commerce website and all the associated Phoenix modules.\n\nPatty has started sending out notifications to all the store managers that\n\nthe deployment was “successful.” She is attaching a list of known errors to\n\nlook out for, an internal web page to get the latest Phoenix status, and\n\ninstructions on how they can report any new problems. We’re keeping all\n\nthe service desk people on standby, and both Chris and my teams are on-\n\ncall to provide early life support. Basically, we’re all on standby to support\n\nthe business.\n\nWith Wes and Patty handling the on-call schedule, I say “good job” to\n\neveryone and pack up my things. On my drive home, I wrack my brain,\n\ntrying to think of how we can keep each Phoenix deployment from causing\n\nan emergency.\n\nChapter 29 • Monday, November 3\n\nAt 7:10 a.m. the following Monday, Chris, Wes, Patty, and John are again all\n\nseated with me in the boardroom. While we’re waiting for Steve, we talk\n\nabout the aftermath of the second Phoenix deployment.\n\nErik is in the back of the room. In front of him is a bowl, an emptied\n\ninstant oatmeal packet, and a French press full of greenish water, with\n\nleaves floating in it.\n\nSeeing my puzzled expression, he says, “Yerba maté. My favorite drink\n\nfrom South America. I never travel without it.”\n\nSteve walks through the door, still talking on his cell phone. “Look,\n\nRon, for the last time, no! No more discounts—even if they were our last\n\nremaining customer. We’ve got to hold the line somewhere. Got it?”\n\nHe hangs up, exasperated, and finally sits down at the head of the table,\n\nmuttering, “Sorry I’m late.” He opens up his folder, taking a moment to\n\nstudy something inside it.\n\n“Despite how the Phoenix deployment went over the weekend, I’m\n\nextremely proud of everything you’ve have done over the last couple of\n\nweeks. Many people have told me about how pleased they are with IT. Even\n\nDick,” he says incredulously. “He’s told me about how you’re helping to\n\nimprove our key company performance measures, and he thinks it will be a\n\ngame changer.”\n\nHe smiles. “I am very proud to be a part of this team that is obviously\n\nworking together better than ever, trusting one another, and getting\n\nincredible results.”",

I won’t be on the cover of\n\nFortune magazine wearing handcuffs, after all.”\n\nJust then, Sarah knocks on the door and enters the room.\n\n“Good morning, Steve,” she says, as she walks in primly, sitting down\n\nbesides Erik. “I take it you wanted to see me about my new marketing\n\ninitiatives?”\n\n“You mean, the unauthorized shifts of work you’re running inside the IT\n\nfactory, like some unscrupulous Chinese plant manager?” Erik asks.\n\nSarah looks Erik up and down, obviously sizing him up.\n\nSteve indicates to John to present his findings. When he concludes,\n\nSteve says sternly, “Sarah, I issued a clear statement. No one is allowed to\n\nstart any new IT initiatives, internal or external, without my explicit\n\napproval. Please explain your actions.”\n\nSarah picks up her iPhone and angrily taps away for a couple of\n\nmoments. Putting it down, she says, “Our competitors are kicking our ass.\n\nWe need every advantage we can get. To achieve the stated objectives that\n\nyou’ve laid out, I can’t wait for IT. I’m sure they’re working very hard,\n\ndoing their best with what they have and what they know—but it’s not\n\nenough. We need to be nimble, and sometimes we need to buy instead of\n\nbuild.”\n\nWes rolls his eyes.\n\nI respond, “I know that IT hasn’t always been able to deliver what\n\nyou’ve needed in the past, and I know Marketing and Sales have gotten\n\nburned. We want the business to win as much as you do. The problem is\n\nthat some of your creative initiatives are jeopardizing other important\n\ncompany commitments, such as complying with state laws and regulations\n\non data privacy, as well as our need to stay focused on Phoenix.\n\n“What you’re proposing could lead to more data integrity problems in\n\nour order entry and inventory management system. Dick, Ron, and Maggie\n\nhave made it clear that we must get this data cleaned up and keep it clean.\n\nNothing is more important to understand customer needs and wants, have\n\nthe right product portfolio, retain our customers, and ultimately increase our\n\nrevenue and market share.”\n\nI add, “Supporting those projects also requires an incredible amount of\n\nwork. We’d need to give your vendors access to our production databases,\n\nexplain how we’ve set them up, do a bunch of firewall changes, and\n\nprobably over a hundred other steps. It’s not just as easy as signing an\n\ninvoice.”\n\nShe looks back at me scathingly. This is the most livid I’ve seen her.\n\nClearly, she doesn’t like me quoting Dick’s company objectives to her,\n\nusing it to deny her what she wants.\n\nIt occurs to me that I might have just made a dangerous enemy.\n\nShe addresses the room, “Since Bill seems to understand the business so\n\nmuch better than I do, why doesn’t he tell all of us what he proposes?”\n\n“Sarah, no one understands better what your area of the business needs\n\nthan you. You’re absolutely entitled to go outside of the company to fulfill\n\nthose needs if we can’t deliver, as long as we make the decision\n\nunderstanding how it might jeopardize another part of the enterprise,” I say\n\nas reasonably as I can. “How about you, Chris, and I meet regularly to see\n\nhow we can help with your upcoming initiatives?”\n\n“I’m very busy,” she says. “I can’t spend a whole day meeting with you\n\nand Chris. I’ve got an entire department to run, you know.”\n\nTo my relief, Steve interjects. “Sarah, you will make the time. I look\n\nforward to hearing how those meetings go and how you resolve your two\n\nunauthorized IT initiatives. Are we clear?”\n\nShe says in a huff, “Yes. I’m just trying to do what’s right for Parts\n\nUnlimited. I’ll do the best with what I have, but I’m not optimistic about the\n\noutcome. You’re really tying my hands here.”\n\nSarah stands up. “By the way, I had a conversation with Bob Strauss\n\nyesterday. I don’t think your leash is as long as you think it is. Bob says we\n\nneed to be looking at strategic options, like splitting up the company. I think\n\nhe’s right.”\n\nAs she leaves, slamming the door behind her, Erik says wryly, “Well,\n\nI’m sure we’ve seen the last of her…”\n\nSteve looks at the door for a moment and then turns to me. “Let’s go to the\n\nlast item on today’s agenda. Bill, you’re concerned that we’re going the\n\nwrong way with Phoenix—that not only are things going to get worse, but\n\nwe may never achieve the desired business outcomes. That is extremely\n\ntroubling.”\n\nI shrug my shoulders. “Now you know everything I know. I was actually\n\nhoping that Erik could give us some insights.”\n\nErik looks up, wiping his mustache with a napkin. “Insights? To me, the\n\nanswer to your problem is obvious. The First Way is all about controlling\n\nthe flow of work from Development to IT Operations. You’ve improved\n\nflow by freezing and throttling the project releases, but your batch sizes are\n\nstill way too large. The deployment failure on Friday is proof. You also\n\nhave way too much WIP still trapped inside the plant, and the worst kind,\n\ntoo. Your deployments are causing unplanned recovery work downstream.”\n\nHe continues, “Now you must prove that you can master the Second\n\nWay, creating constant feedback loops from IT Operations back into\n\nDevelopment, designing quality into the product at the earliest stages. To do\n\nthat, you can’t have nine-month-long releases. You need much faster\n\nfeedback.\n\n“You’ll never hit the target you’re aiming at if you can fire the cannon\n\nonly once every nine months. Stop thinking about Civil War era cannons.\n\nThink antiaircraft guns.”\n\nHe stands up to throw his bowl of oatmeal in the wastebasket. Then he\n\npeers in the wastebasket and fishes his spoon back out.\n\nTurning around, he says, “In any system of work, the theoretical ideal is\n\nsingle-piece flow, which maximizes throughput and minimizes variance.\n\nYou get there by continually reducing batch sizes.\n\n“You’re doing the exact opposite by lengthening the Phoenix release\n\nintervals and increasing the number of features in each release. You’ve even\n\nlost the ability to control variance from one release to the next.”\n\nHe pauses. “That’s ridiculous, given all the investments you’ve made\n\nvirtualizing your production systems. You still do deployments like they’re\n\nphysical servers. As Goldratt would say, you’ve deployed an amazing\n\ntechnology, but because you haven’t changed the way you work, you\n\nhaven’t actually diminished a limitation.”\n\nI look around at everyone, confirming that no one understands what Erik\n\nis talking about, either. I say, “The last Phoenix release was caused by a\n\nproduction change to the database server that didn’t get replicated in the\n\nupstream environments. I was about to agree with Chris. We should pause\n\ndeployments until we can figure out how to keep all the environments\n\nsynchronized. That means slowing down the releases, right?”\n\nRemaining standing, Erik snorts. “Bill, that is simultaneously one of the\n\nsmartest things I’ve heard all month—and one of the dumbest.”\n\nI don’t react as Erik looks at one of the drawings on the boardroom wall.\n\nPointing at it, he says, “Wilbur, what kind of engine is this?”\n\nWes grimaces and says, “That’s a 1,300 CC engine for a 2007 Suzuki\n\nHayabusa dragster motorcycle. And by the way, it’s ‘Wes.’ Not ‘Wilbur.’\n\nMy name hasn’t changed since last time.”\n\n“Yes, of course,” Erik responds. “Dragster motorcycles are great fun to\n\nwatch. This one probably goes over 230 miles per hour. How many gears\n\ndoes this racer have?”\n\nWithout pausing, Wes responds, “Six. Constant mesh, with a #532 chain\n\ndrive.”\n\n“Does that include the reverse gear?” Erik asks.\n\n“That model doesn’t have a reverse gear,” Wes replies quickly.\n\nErik nods as he looks more closely at the drawing on the wall, saying,\n\n“Interesting, isn’t it? No reverse gear. So why should your flow of work\n\nhave a reverse gear?”\n\nThe silence lengthens when Steve finally says, “Look, Erik. Can you\n\njust say what you’re thinking? To you, this may be a fun game to play, but\n\nwe’ve got a business to save.”\n\nErik looks at Steve closely, studying him. “Think like a plant manager.\n\nWhen you see work going upstream, what does it mean to you?”\n\nHe quickly responds, “The flow of work should ideally go in one\n\ndirection only: forward. When I see work going backward, I think ‘waste.’\n\nIt might be because of defects, lack of specification, or rework…\n\nRegardless, it’s something we should fix.”\n\nErik nods. “Excellent. I believe that, too.”\n\nHe picks up his empty French press and spoon from the table, puts them\n\ninto his suitcase and starts zipping it up. “The flow of work goes in one\n\ndirection only: forward. Create a system of work in IT that does that.\n\nRemember, the goal is single-piece flow.”\n\nHe turns to me. “Incidentally, this will also solve the problem that\n\nyou’ve been fretting about with Dick. An inevitable consequence of long\n\nrelease cycles is that you’ll never hit the internal rate of return targets, once\n\nyou factor in the cost of labor. You must have faster cycle times. If Phoenix\n\nis preventing you from doing that, then figure out how to deliver the\n\nfeatures some other way.\n\n“Without being like Sarah, of course,” he says with a small smile.\n\nPicking up his suitcase, he adds, “To do this, you’ll need to put Brent at the\n\nvery front of the line, just like Herbie in The Goal. Brent needs to be\n\nworking at the earliest stages of the development process. Bill, you of all\n\npeople should be able to figure this out.\n\n“Good luck, guys,” he says, and we all watch as he closes the door\n\nbehind him.\n\nSteve finally says, “Anyone have any suggestions or proposals?”\n\nChris replies first. “As I shared earlier, even minor Phoenix bug fix\n\nreleases are so problematic that we can’t afford to be doing them monthly.\n\nDespite what Erik said, I think we need to slow down our release schedule.\n\nI propose moving to one release every other month.”\n\n“Unacceptable,” Steve says, shaking his head. “Last quarter, we missed\n\nalmost every target we set by a mile. This will be our fifth consecutive\n\nquarterly miss—and that was after we lowered our expectations with Wall\n\nStreet. All our hopes depend on completing Phoenix. You’re telling me that\n\nwe’re going to have to wait even longer to get the features we need, while\n\nour competitors continue to pull away from us? Impossible.”\n\n“It may be ‘impossible’ to you, but look at it from my perspective,”\n\nChris says levelly. “I need my developers building new features. They can’t\n\nbe constantly tied up with Bill’s team, dealing with deployment issues.”\n\nSteve replies, “This quarter is make or break. We promised the world\n\nthat we’d get Phoenix out last month, but because of all the features we\n\ndelayed, we’re not getting the sales benefits that we hoped for. Now we’re\n\nover a month through the quarter, with the holiday buying season in fewer\n\nthan thirty days. We are out of time.”\n\nThinking this through, I force myself to accept that Chris is stating the\n\nreality he sees, and that it is based on facts. And the same goes for Steve.\n\nI say to Chris, “If you say that the Phoenix team needs to slow down,\n\nyou won’t get any argument from me. In the Marines, when you have a\n\ncompany of a hundred men with a man wounded, the first thing you lose is\n\nmobility.\n\n“But we still need to figure out how to achieve what Steve needs,” I\n\ncontinue. “As Erik suggested, if we can’t do that inside the Phoenix\n\nframework, maybe we can do it outside of Phoenix. I propose we form a\n\nSWAT team by detaching a small squad from the main Phoenix team, telling\n\nthem to figure out what features can help us hit our revenue goals as soon as\n\npossible. There’s not a lot of time, so we’ll need to select the features\n\ncarefully. We’ll tell them that they’re allowed to break whatever rules\n\nrequired to get the job done.”\n\nChris considers this for a moment and finally nods. “Phoenix is all about\n\nhelping customers buy things from us, faster and in larger quantities. The\n\nlast two releases have all been putting down the groundwork to make that\n\nhappen, but the features to really increase sales are still bogged down. We\n\nneed to focus on generating good customer recommendations and enable\n\nMarketing to create promotions to sell profitable products that we have in\n\ninventory.”\n\n“We have years of customer purchasing data and because of our branded\n\ncredit cards, we know our customer demographics and preferences,” Steve\n\ninterjects, leaning forward. “Marketing assures me that we can create some\n\nreally compelling offers to our customers, if we could only get those\n\nfeatures shipped.”\n\nChris, Wes, and Patty dive in to discuss this further, while John looks\n\ndubious. Eventually Wes says, “You know, this just may work.” When\n\neveryone nods, including John, I feel there’s a sense of excitement and\n\npossibility that was missing just minutes ago.\n\nChapter 30 • Monday, November 3\n\nAn hour after the meeting with Steve adjourned, I’m still mulling over\n\nErik’s cryptic comments. I feel like we’re on the verge of something big,\n\nbut I have too many questions. I finally decide to call him.\n\n“Yeah?” he answers.\n\n“Bill here,” I say. “I need some more clues about what the hell we’re\n\nsupposed to be doing…”\n\n“Meet me outside the building,” he says, hanging up.\n\nWhen I get outside, the wind is gusty and fierce. I look around for a\n\ncouple of moments, when I hear a horn honk. Erik is in an expensive-\n\nlooking red BMW convertible, with the top down. “Come on in. Hurry!”\n\n“Nice ride,” I say, climbing into the passenger seat.\n\n“Thanks,” he says. “My friend insisted that I borrow this while I’m in\n\ntown.”\n\nAs he floors the accelerator, I grab the armrest and hurriedly buckle my\n\nseatbelt. I see a purse on the floor, and immediately wonder who this\n\n“friend” is.\n\n“We’re heading back to MRP-8,” he says.\n\nWhen I ask him to raise the convertible top, he looks over at me and\n\nsays, “I thought there was no such thing as an ‘ex-Marine.’ Maybe they\n\nmade you guys softer than in my day.”\n\n“You were in the service?” I ask, trying to hide my chattering teeth.\n\nHe laughs. “Over twenty years.”\n\n“You retired as an officer, I suppose?” I asked.",

      "content": "“Major, Special Forces, US Army,” he replies, looking at me. I keep\n\nhoping he’ll keep his eyes on the road, given how fast we’re going. Instead,\n\nhe continues, “Same branch as Steve, but he joined as an officer. I joined as\n\nan enlisted grunt, just like you.”\n\nHe doesn’t reveal any more, but he has already told me enough to\n\nunderstand his military career. He was obviously a senior NCO, like many I\n\nhad to deal with on a daily basis, now recognizing his all-too-familiar\n\ndemeanor and physical bearing. He must have been identified as one of\n\nthose rare high-potential people by the higher-ups, who decided to invest in\n\nhis future, sending him to college and Officer Candidate School, then\n\nrejoining the ranks as the oldest second lieutenant around, probably ten\n\nyears older than everybody else.\n\nIt takes a special person to go through that.\n\nWe make it to the plant in record time and are now standing on the\n\ncatwalk. He begins the speech that I’ve been expecting. “A manufacturing\n\nplant is a system. The raw materials start on one side, and a million things\n\nneed to go just right in order for it to leave as finished goods as scheduled\n\nout the other side. Everything works together. If any work center is warring\n\nwith the other work centers, especially if Manufacturing is at war with\n\nEngineering, every inch of progress will be a struggle.”\n\nErik turns to me, pointing, “You’ve got to stop thinking like a work\n\ncenter supervisor. You need to think bigger, like a plant manager. Or better\n\nyet, think like the person who designed this manufacturing plant and all of\n\nthe processes it relies upon. They look at the entire flow of work, identify\n\nwhere the constraints are, and use every possible technology and bit of\n\nprocess knowledge they have to ensure work is performed effectively and\n\nefficiently. They harness their ‘inner-Allspaw.’”\n\nI’m about to ask what he means by an “Allspaw,” when he just waves\n\nmy question away. “In manufacturing, we have a measure called takt time,\n\nwhich is the cycle time needed in order to keep up with customer demand.\n\nIf any operation in the flow of work takes longer than the takt time, you will\n\nnot be able to keep up with customer demand.”\n\n“So when you run around screaming, ‘Oh no! We don’t have\n\nenvironments for Phoenix ready! Help, help! Oh, no! We can’t deploy,\n\nbecause someone broke the Phoenix environments again!’” he says in a\n\nhigh, girlish voice, “That means the cycle time of some critical operation in\n\nyour area of responsibility is greater than the takt time. That is the reason\n\nyou can’t keep up with customer demand.\n\n“As part of the Second Way, you need to create a feedback loop that\n\ngoes all the way back to the earliest parts of product definition, design, and\n\ndevelopment,” he says. “Given the conversations you’re having with Dick,\n\nyou may even be able to go earlier in the process.”\n\nPointing at the floor, he says, “Look down at the long lane of equipment\n\nbetween the orange tape on the floor. That lane makes some of the highest\n\nprofit items we have. But as fate would have it, that particular flow of work\n\ninvolves two operations that have the longest setup and process times:\n\napplication of a paint powder coating and baking it in the heat treat oven.”\n\nHe looks up, arms spread outward. “Back in the day, the cycle time for\n\nthose two operations was so much larger than takt time, we were never able\n\nto keep up with customer demand. How can life be so unfair? The most\n\nprofitable items used both of our constraints: the heat treat oven and the\n\npaint booths! What do we do?\n\n“Customers were even offering to throw money at us, begging us for\n\nmore of these widgets, but we had to turn them away. The setup time for\n\neach job took hours or even days. We had to use enormous batch sizes to\n\nmeet demand. We had these huge trays to paint and would bake as many\n\nunits at a time as possible. We knew we had to reduce batch sizes to\n\nimprove throughput, but everyone said that it couldn’t be done.”\n\n“How Toyota solved this problem is legendary,” he says. “During the\n\n1950s, they had a hood stamping process that had a change-over time of\n\nalmost three days. It required moving huge, heavy dies that weighed many\n\ntons. Like us, the setup times were so long that they needed to use large\n\nbatch sizes, which prevented them from using one stamping machine to\n\nmanufacture multiple different car models simultaneously. You can’t make\n\none hood for a Prius and then one hood for a Camry if it takes you three\n\ndays to do the changeovers, right?\n\n“What did they do?” he asks rhetorically. “They closely observed all the\n\nsteps required to do the changeover, and then put in a series of preparations\n\nand improvements that brought the changeover time down to under ten\n\nminutes. And that, of course, is where the legendary ‘single-minute\n\nexchange of die’ term comes from.\n\n“We studied all the works of Ohno, Spear, and Rother. We knew that we\n\nhad to decrease our batch size, but we weren’t dealing with hood stamping\n\ndies. We were dealing with painting and curing,” he continues. “After\n\nweeks of brainstorming, investigation, and experimentation with\n\nEngineering, we had a crazy idea: Maybe we could do the painting and\n\ncuring in a single machine. We cobbled together an oven that also applied\n\nthe paint powder onto the parts, which were pulled through on a chain and\n\ngear that we took from a bicycle.\n\n“We combined four work centers into one, eliminating over thirty\n\nmanual, error-prone steps, completely automating the work cycle, achieving\n\nsingle-piece flow, and eliminating all that setup time. Throughput went\n\nthrough the roof.\n\n“The benefits were enormous,” he says with pride. “First, when defects\n\nwere found, we fixed them immediately and we didn’t have to scrap all the\n\nother parts in that batch. Second, WIP was brought down because each work\n\ncenter never overproduced product, only to sit in the queue of the next work\n\ncenter. But the most important benefit was that order lead times were cut\n\nfrom one month to less than a week. We could build and deliver whatever\n\nand however many the customer wanted and never had a warehouse full of\n\ncrap that we’d need to liquidate at fire-sale prices.\n\n“So, now it’s your turn,” he says sternly, poking a finger into my chest.\n\n“You’ve got to figure out how to decrease your changeover time and enable\n\nfaster deployment cycle time.\n\n“I think your target should be…” he says, pausing for a moment. “Ten\n\ndeploys a day. Why not?”\n\nMy jaw drops. “That’s impossible.”\n\n“Oh, really?” he says, deadpan. “Let me tell you a story. Back in 2009, I\n\nwas a board director at a technology company, where one of our engineers\n\nwent to the Velocity Conference and came back raving like a madman, full\n\nof dangerous, impossible ideas. He saw a presentation given by John\n\nAllspaw and his colleague Paul Hammond that flipped the world on its\n\nhead. Allspaw and Hammond ran the IT Operations and Engineering groups\n\nat Flickr. Instead of fighting like cats and dogs, they talked about how they\n\nwere working together to routinely do ten deploys a day! This is in a world\n\nwhen most IT organizations were mostly doing quarterly or annual\n\ndeployments. Imagine that. He was doing deploys at a rate one thousand\n\ntimes faster than the previous state of the art.\n\n“Let me tell you,” he continues, “we all thought that this engineer had\n\nlost his marbles. But I learned that the practices that Allspaw and Hammond\n\nespoused are the inevitable outcome of applying the Three Ways to the IT\n\nvalue stream. It totally changed how we managed IT and it saved our\n\ncompany.\n\n“How did they do it?” I ask, dumbfounded.\n\n“Good question,” he replies. “Allspaw taught us that Dev and Ops\n\nworking together, along with QA and the business, are a super-tribe that can\n\nachieve amazing things. They also knew that until code is in production, no\n\nvalue is actually being generated, because it’s merely WIP stuck in the\n\nsystem. He kept reducing the batch size, enabling fast feature flow. In part,\n\nhe did this by ensuring environments were always available when they were\n\nneeded. He automated the build and deployment process, recognizing that\n\ninfrastructure could be treated as code, just like the application that\n\nDevelopment ships. That enabled him to create a one-step environment\n\ncreation and deploy procedure, just like we figured out a way to do one-step\n\npainting and curing.\n\n“So, we now know that Allspaw and Hammond weren’t so crazy after\n\nall. Jez Humble and Dave Farley independently came to the same\n\nconclusions, and then codified the practices and principles that enable\n\nmultiple deployments per day in their seminal book Continuous Delivery.\n\nEric Ries then showed us how this capability can help the business learn\n\nand win in his Lean Startup work.”\n\nAs Erik talks, he is as animated as I’ve ever seen him. Shaking his head,\n\nhe looks sternly at me.\n\n“Your next step should be obvious by now, grasshopper. In order for you\n\nto keep up with customer demand, which includes your upstream comrades\n\nin Development,” he says, “you need to create what Humble and Farley\n\ncalled a deployment pipeline. That’s your entire value stream from code\n\ncheck-in to production. That’s not an art. That’s production. You need to get\n\neverything in version control. Everything. Not just the code, but everything\n\nrequired to build the environment. Then you need to automate the entire\n\nenvironment creation process. You need a deployment pipeline where you\n\ncan create test and production environments, and then deploy code into\n\nthem, entirely on-demand. That’s how you reduce your setup times and\n\neliminate errors, so you can finally match whatever rate of change\n\nDevelopment sets the tempo at.”\n\n“Hold on,” I say. “What is it exactly that I’m supposed to automate?”\n\nErik looks at me sternly. “Go ask Brent. Get him assigned to that new\n\nteam, and make sure that he doesn’t get distracted. Now more than ever,\n\nuntil you get your build process automated, he is your bottleneck. Get the\n\nthings that are in his head encoded into the build procedures. Get humans\n\nout of the deployment business. Figure out how to get to ten deploys a day.”\n\nI can’t get over my skepticism. “Ten deploys a day? I’m pretty sure that\n\nno one is asking for that. Aren’t you setting a target that’s higher than what\n\nthe business needs?”\n\nErik sighs, rolling his eyes. “Stop focusing on the deployment target\n\nrate. Business agility is not just about raw speed. It’s about how good you\n\nare at detecting and responding to changes in the market and being able to\n\ntake larger and more calculated risks. It’s about continual experimentation,\n\nlike Scott Cook did at Intuit, where they did over forty experiments during\n\nthe peak tax filing season to figure out how to maximize customer\n\nconversion rates. During the peak tax filing season!\n\n“If you can’t out-experiment and beat your competitors in time to\n\nmarket and agility, you are sunk. Features are always a gamble. If you’re\n\nlucky, ten percent will get the desired benefits. So the faster you can get\n\nthose features to market and test them, the better off you’ll be. Incidentally,\n\nyou also pay back the business faster for the use of capital, which means the\n\nbusiness starts making money faster, too.\n\n“Steve is betting his entire survival on your ability to execute and\n\ndeploy capabilities faster. So, get to work with Chris to figure out how at\n\nevery stage of the agile development process, you not only have shippable\n\ncode, but a working environment it can deploy into!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” I say. “But why did you drag me all the way over here in\n\nthe freezing cold? Wouldn’t explaining it on a whiteboard have been\n\nenough?”\n\n“You think IT Operations is rocket-science compared to manufacturing.\n\nWhat absolute baloney,” he says dismissively. “From where I’m sitting, the\n\npeople in this building have been far more creative and courageous than\n\nanything I’ve seen come from you IT guys so far.”\n\nChapter 31 • Monday, November 3\n\nIt’s 12:13 p.m. when I walk into the SWAT team kick-off meeting. My hair is\n\ndripping wet and my shirt is soaked from my ride back in Erik’s\n\nconvertible. Chris is talking. “—and so Steve has authorized this small team\n\nto deliver the promotion functionality and do whatever it takes to make a\n\npositive impact on the holiday shopping season.”\n\nChris turns to me and points to the back of the room. “I went ahead and\n\nordered lunch for everyone to kick this off. Go ahead and—Jesus—what\n\nhappened to you?”\n\nI wave away his question. Looking at where he’s pointing, I’m\n\npleasantly surprised to see a turkey sandwich lunch box still at the back.\n\nGrabbing it, I take a seat and try to gauge the temperature of everyone in\n\nthe room, especially Brent.\n\nBrent responds, “Explain again why I’m here?”\n\n“That’s what we’re here to figure out,” Wes says earnestly. “You know\n\nas much as we do. One of the potential board members insisted that you be\n\na part of this team. Quite frankly, he’s been right enough times that I trust\n\nhim, even if I have no freaking idea why.”\n\nPatty chimes in. “Well, he gave us a couple of clues. He said that the\n\nproblems we need to focus on are the deployment process and the way\n\nwe’re building the environments. He seems to think we must be doing\n\nsomething fundamentally wrong because of all the chaos resulting from\n\neach Phoenix deployment.”",

      "content": "As I unwrap my sandwich I say, “I just came back from a meeting with\n\nhim. He showed me a bunch of stuff and explained how they do single-\n\nminute exchanges of die at Toyota. He thinks we need to build the\n\ncapability to do ten deploys per day. He not only insists this is possible but\n\nalso that it supports the feature deployment cycles the business needs, not\n\njust to survive, but to win in the marketplace.”\n\nSurprisingly, Chris speaks out the most fiercely. “What? Why in the\n\nworld would we need to do ten deploys a day? Our sprint intervals are three\n\nweeks long. We don’t have anything to deploy ten times a day!”\n\nPatty shakes her head. “Are you sure? What about bug fixes? What\n\nabout performance enhancements when the site grinds to a halt, like what’s\n\nhappened during the last two major launches? Wouldn’t you love to do\n\nthese types of changes in production routinely, without having to break all\n\nthe rules to do some sort of emergency change?”\n\nChris thinks for a couple of moments before responding. “Interesting. I\n\nwould normally call those types of fixes a patch or a minor release. But\n\nyou’re right—those are deployments, too. It would be great if we could roll\n\nout fixes more quickly, but come on, ten deploys a day?”\n\nThinking about what Erik said, I add, “How about enabling Marketing\n\nto make their own changes to content or business rules or enabling faster\n\nexperimentation and A/B split testing, to see what offers work best?”\n\nWes puts both of his hands on the table. “Mark my words, folks. It can’t\n\nbe done. We’re dealing with the laws of physics here. Forget about how\n\nlong it currently takes, which requires over one week of preparation and\n\nover eight hours to do the actual deployment! You can only put bits down\n\non the disk so fast.”\n\nThat’s exactly what I would have said before the plant tour with Erik. I\n\nsay earnestly, “Look, maybe you’re right, but humor me for a second: Just\n\nhow many steps are there in the entire end-to-end deployment process? Are\n\nwe talking about twenty steps, two hundred, or two thousand?”\n\nWes scratches his head for a moment before he says, “What do you\n\nthink, Brent? I would have thought about a hundred steps…”\n\n“Really?” Brent responds. “I would have thought it was more like\n\ntwenty steps.”\n\nWilliam interjects, “I’m not sure where you’re starting to count, but if\n\nwe begin at the point where Development commits code and we label it as a\n\n‘release candidate,’ I can probably come up with a hundred steps, even\n\nbefore we hand it to IT Operations.”\n\nUh-oh.\n\nWes interrupts, “No, no, no. Bill said ‘deployment steps.’ Let’s not open\n\nup a can of—”\n\nAs Wes talks, I think about Erik challenging me to think like a plant\n\nmanager as opposed to a work center supervisor. I suddenly realize that he\n\nprobably meant that I needed to span the departmental boundaries of\n\nDevelopment and IT Operations.\n\n“You guys are both correct,” I say, interrupting Wes and William.\n\n“William, would you mind writing down all the steps on the whiteboard?\n\nI’d suggest starting at ‘code committed,’ and keep going until the handoff to\n\nour group.”\n\nHe nods and walks to the whiteboard and starts drawing boxes,\n\ndiscussing the steps as he goes. Over the next ten minutes, he proves that\n\nthere are likely over one hundred steps, including the automated tests run in\n\nthe Dev environment, creating a QA environment that matches Dev,\n\ndeploying code into it, running all the tests, deploying and migrating into a\n\nfresh staging environment that matches QA, load testing, and finally the\n\nbaton being passed to IT Operations.\n\nWhen William is finished, there are thirty boxes on the board.\n\nLooking over at Wes, I see that rather than looking irritated, he actually\n\nappears deep in thought, rubbing his chin while looking at the diagram.\n\nI indicate to Brent and Wes that one of them should continue where\n\nWilliam left off.\n\nBrent gets up and starts drawing boxes to indicate the packaging of the\n\ncode for deployment; preparing new server instances; loading and\n\nconfiguring the operating system, databases, and applications; making all\n\nthe changes to the networks, firewalls, and load balancers; and then testing\n\nto make sure the deployment completed successfully.\n\nI contemplate the entirety of the diagram, which surprisingly reminds\n\nme of the plant floor. Each of these steps is like a work center, each with\n\ndifferent machines, men, methods, and measures. IT work is probably much\n\nmore complex than manufacturing work. Not only is the work invisible,\n\nmaking it more difficult to track, but there are far more things that could go\n\nwrong.\n\nCountless configurations need to be set correctly, systems need enough\n\nmemory, all the files need to be put in the right place, and all code and the\n\nentire environment need to be operating correctly.\n\nEven one small mistake could take everything down. Surely this meant\n\nthat we needed even more rigor and discipline and planning than in\n\nmanufacturing.\n\nI can’t wait to tell Erik this.\n\nRealizing the importance and enormity of the challenge in front of us, I\n\nwalk to the whiteboard, and pick up the red marker. I say, “I’m going to put\n\na big red star on each step where we had problems during previous\n\nlaunches.”\n\nStarting to make marks on the whiteboard, I explain, “Because a fresh\n\nQA environment wasn’t available, we used an old version; because of all the\n\ntest failures, we made code and environment changes to the QA\n\nenvironment, which never made it back into the Dev or Production\n\nenvironments; and because we never synchronized all the environments, we\n\nhad the same problems the next time around, too.”\n\nLeaving a trail of red stars, I start marching into Brent’s boxes.\n\n“Because we didn’t have correct deployment instructions, it took us five\n\nturns to get the packaging and deployment scripts right. This blew up in\n\nproduction because the environment was incorrectly built, which I’ve\n\nalready brought up.”\n\nEven though I didn’t do it on purpose, by the time I’m done, almost all\n\nof William and Brent’s boxes had red stars next to them.\n\nTurning around, I see everyone’s dispirited faces as they take in what\n\nI’ve done. Realizing my potential mistake, I hurriedly add, “Look, my goal\n\nisn’t to blame anyone or say that we’re doing a crappy job. I’m merely\n\ntrying to get down on paper exactly what we’re doing and get some\n\nobjective measures of each step. Let’s fight the problem that’s on the\n\nwhiteboard as a team and not blame one another, okay?”\n\nPatty says, “You know, this reminds me of something that I’ve seen the\n\nplant floor guys use all the time. If one of them walked in, I’m guessing that\n\nthey’d think we’re building a ‘value stream map.’ Mind if I add a couple of\n\nelements?”\n\nI pass the whiteboard marker to her and sit down.\n\nFor each of the boxes, she asks how long each of these operations\n\ntypically takes then jots the number on top of the box. Next, she asks\n\nwhether this step is typically where work has to wait then draws a triangle\n\nbefore the box, indicating work in process.\n\nHoly crap. To Patty, the similarity between our deployments and a plant\n\nline isn’t some academic question. She’s treating our deployment as if it\n\nactually was a plant line!\n\nShe’s using Lean tools and techniques that the manufacturing folks use\n\nto document and improve their processes.\n\nSuddenly, I understand what Erik meant when he talked about the\n\n“deployment pipeline.” Even though you can’t see our work like in a\n\nmanufacturing plant, it’s still a value stream.\n\nI correct myself. It’s our value stream, and I’m confident that we’re on\n\nthe brink of figuring out how to dramatically increase the flow of work\n\nthrough it.\n\nAfter Patty finishes recording the durations of the steps, she redraws the\n\nboxes, using short labels to describe the process steps. On a separate\n\nwhiteboard, she writes down two bullet points: “environments” and\n\n“deployment.”\n\nPointing to what she just wrote, she says, “With the current process, two\n\nissues keep coming up: At every stage of the deployment process,\n\nenvironments are never available when we need them, and even when they\n\nare, there’s considerable rework required to get them all synchronized with\n\none another. Yes?”\n\nWes snorts, saying, “No reward for stating something that obvious, but\n\nyou’re right.”\n\nShe continues, “The other obvious source of rework and long setup time\n\nis in the code packaging process, where IT Operations takes what\n\nDevelopment checks into version control and then generates the\n\ndeployment packages. Although Chris and his team do their best to\n\ndocument the code and configurations, something always falls through the\n\ncracks, which are only exposed when the code fails to run in the\n\nenvironment after deployment. Correct?”\n\nThis time, Wes doesn’t respond right away. Brent beats him, saying,\n\n“You’ve nailed it. William can probably relate to these problems: the\n\nrelease instructions are never up-to-date, so we’re always scrambling, trying\n\nto futz with it, having to rewrite the installer scripts and install it over and\n\nover again…”\n\n“Yep,” William says, nodding adamantly.\n\n“I’d suggest we focus on those two areas, then,” she says, looking at the\n\nboard and then grabbing her seat again. “Any ideas?”\n\nBrent says, “Maybe William and I can work together to build a\n\ndeployment run book, to capture all the lessons learned from our mistakes?”\n\nI nod, listening to everyone’s ideas, but none of them seem like the\n\nmassive breakthrough we need. Erik had described the reduction of setup\n\ntime for the door stamping process. He seemed to indicate that it was\n\nimportant. But why?\n\n“Having each group cobble an environment together obviously isn’t\n\nworking. Whatever we do must take us a big step toward this ‘ten deploys a\n\nday’ target,” I say. “This implies that we need a significant amount of\n\nautomation. Brent, what would it take for us to be able to create a common\n\nenvironment creation process, so we can simultaneously build the Dev, QA,\n\nand Production environments at the same time, and keep them\n\nsynchronized?”\n\n“Interesting idea,” Brent says, looking at the board. He stands up and\n\ndraws three boxes labeled “Dev,” “QA,” and “Production.” And then\n\nunderneath them, he draws another box labeled “Build Procedure” with\n\narrows into each of the boxes above.\n\n“That’s actually pretty brilliant, Bill,” he says. “If we had a common\n\nbuild procedure, and everyone used these tools to create their environments,\n\nthe developers would actually be writing code in an environment that at\n\nleast resembles the Production environment. That alone would be a huge\n\nimprovement.”\n\nHe takes the marker cap out of his mouth. “To build the Phoenix\n\nenvironment, we use a bunch of scripts that we’ve written. With a bit of\n\ndocumentation and cleanup, I bet we could cobble together something\n\nusable in a couple of days.”\n\nTurning to Chris, I say, “This seems promising. If we could standardize\n\nthe environments and get these in daily use by Development, QA, and IT\n\nOperations, we could eliminate the majority of variance that’s causing so\n\nmuch grief in the deployment process.”\n\nChris seems excited. “Brent, if it’s okay with you and everyone else, I’d\n\nlike to invite you to our team sprints, so that we can get environment\n\ncreation integrated into the development process as early as possible. Right\n\nnow, we focus mostly on having deployable code at the end of the project. I\n\npropose we change that requirement. At each three-week sprint interval, we\n\nnot only need to have deployable code but also the exact environment that\n\nthe code deploys into, and have that checked into version control, too.”\n\nBrent smiles widely at the suggestion. Before Wes can respond, I say, “I\n\ncompletely agree. But before we go further, can we investigate the other\n\nissue that Patty highlighted? Even if we adopted Chris’ suggestions, there’s\n\nstill the issue of the deployment scripts. If we had a magic wand, whenever\n\nwe have a fresh QA environment, how should we deploy the code? Every\n\ntime we deploy, we constantly ping-pong code, scripts, and God knows\n\nwhat else among groups.”\n\nPatty chimes in. “On the manufacturing floor, whenever we see work go\n\nbackward, that’s rework. When that happens, you can bet that the amount of\n\ndocumentation and information flow is going to be pretty poor, which\n\nmeans nothing is reproducible and that it’s going to get worse over time as\n\nwe try to go faster. They call this ‘non-value-add’ activity or ‘waste.’”\n\nLooking at the first whiteboard with all the boxes, she says, “If we\n\nredesign the process, we need to have the right people involved upfront.\n\nThis is like the manufacturing engineering group ensuring that all parts are\n\ndesigned so that they are optimized for manufacturing and that the\n\nmanufacturing lines are optimized for the parts, ideally in single-piece\n\nflow.”\n\nI nod, smiling at the similarities between what Patty is recommending\n\nand what Erik suggested earlier today.\n\nTurning to William and Brent, I say, “Okay, guys, you have the magic\n\nwand. You’re at the front of the line. Tell me how you’d design the\n\nmanufacturing line so that work never goes backward, and the flow is\n\nmoving forward quickly and efficiently.”\n\nWhen they both give me a blank look, I say with some exasperation,\n\n“You have a damned magic wand. Use it!”\n\n“How big is the magic wand?” William asks.\n\nI repeat what I said to Maggie. “It’s a very powerful magic wand. It can\n\ndo anything.”\n\nWilliam walks to the whiteboard and points at a box called “code\n\ncommit.” “If I could wave this magic wand, I would change this step.\n\nInstead of getting source code or compiled code from Dev through source\n\ncontrol, I want packaged code that’s ready to be deployed.”\n\n“And you know,” he continues, “I want this so much, I’d happily\n\nvolunteer to take over responsibility for package creation. I know exactly\n\nthe person I’d assign, too. She would be responsible for the Dev handoff.\n\nWhen code is labeled ‘ready to test,’ we would then generate and commit\n\nthe packaged code, which would trigger an automated deployment into the\n\nQA environment. And later, maybe even the Production environment, too.”\n\n“Wow. You’d really do that?” Wes asks. “That would be really great.\n\nLet’s do it—unless Brent really wants to keep doing the packaging?”\n\n“Are you kidding?” Brent asks, bursting out laughing. “I’ll buy whoever\n\nthis person is drinks for the rest of the year! I love this idea. And I want to\n\nhelp build the new deployment tools. Like I said, I’ve got a bunch of tools\n\nthat I’ve written that we can use as a starting point.”\n\nI can feel the energy and excitement in the room. I’m amazed at how\n\nquickly we went from believing the ‘ten deploys a day’ target was a\n\ndelusional fantasy, to wondering how close we can get.\n\nSuddenly, Patty looks up and says, “Wait a second. This entire Phoenix\n\nmodule deals with customer purchase data, which has to be protected.\n\nShouldn’t someone from John’s team be a part of this effort, as well?”\n\nWe all look at one another, agreeing that he needs to be involved. And\n\nonce again, I marvel at how much we’ve changed as an organization.\n\nChapter 32 • Monday, November 10\n\nThe next two weeks fly by with the SWAT team activities taking up much of\n\nmy time, as well as Wes’ and Patty’s.\n\nIt’s been over a decade since I’ve had daily interactions with developers.\n\nI had forgotten how quirky they can be. To me, they seem more like indie\n\nmusicians than engineers.\n\nIn my day, developers wore pocket protectors—not vintage T-shirts and\n\nsandals—and carried slide rules, not skateboards.\n\nIn many ways, most of these guys are my temperamental opposites. I\n\nlike people who create and follow processes, people who value rigor and\n\ndiscipline. These guys shun process in favor of whim and whimsy.\n\nBut thank goodness they’re here.\n\nI know that stereotyping an entire profession isn’t fair. I know that all\n\nthese diverse skills are vital if we want to succeed. The challenge is how to\n\npull all of us together, so that we’re working toward the same goal.\n\nThe first challenge: to name the SWAT team project. We couldn’t keep\n\ncalling it “mini-Phoenix,” so we eventually had to spend an hour debating\n\nnames.\n\nMy guys wanted to call it “Cujo” or “Stiletto.” But the developers\n\nwanted to call it “Unicorn.”\n\nUnicorn? Like rainbows and Care Bears?\n\nAnd against all my expectations, “Unicorn” wins the vote.\n\nDevelopers. I’ll never understand them.",

      "content": "Regardless of my distaste for the name, Project Unicorn was shaping up\n\namazingly well. With the objective of doing whatever it takes to deliver\n\neffective customer recommendations and promotions, we started with a\n\nclean code base that was completely decoupled from the Phoenix behemoth.\n\nIt was amazing to see how this team tackled obstacles. One of the first\n\nchallenges was to start analyzing the customer purchase data, which was the\n\nfirst brick wall. Even touching the production databases meant linking to\n\ntheir libraries, and any changes to them would require convincing the\n\narchitecture team to approve it.\n\nSince the entire company could be out of business by that time, the\n\ndevelopers and Brent decided to create a completely new database, using\n\nopen source tools, with data copied from not only Phoenix but also the\n\norder entry and inventory management systems.\n\nBy doing this, we could develop, test, and even run in operations\n\nwithout impacting Phoenix or other business critical applications. And by\n\ndecoupling ourselves from the other projects, we could make all the\n\nchanges we needed to without putting other projects at risk. At the same\n\ntime, we wouldn’t get bogged down in the processes that we didn’t need to\n\nbe a part of.\n\nI wholeheartedly approved and applauded this approach. However, a\n\nsmall part of me wondered how we’re going to manage the inevitable\n\nsprawl, if every project could spawn a new database on a whim. I remind\n\nmyself to ensure that we standardize what types of databases we can put\n\ninto production to ensure that we have the right skills to support these long-\n\nterm.\n\nIn the meantime, Brent worked with William’s team to create the build\n\nprocedures and automated mechanisms that could simultaneously create the\n\nDev, QA, and Production environments. We were all astonished that within\n\nthe three-week sprint, perhaps for the first time in memory, all the\n\ndevelopers were using exactly the same operating system, library versions,\n\ndatabases, database settings, and so forth.\n\n“This is unbelievable,” one of the developers said at the sprint\n\nretrospective, held at the end of each sprint. “For Phoenix, it takes us three\n\nor four weeks for new developers to get builds running on their machine,\n\nbecause we’ve never assembled the complete list of the gazillion things you\n\nneed installed in order for it to compile and run. But now all we have to do\n\nis check out the virtual machine that Brent and team built, and they’re all\n\nready to go.”\n\nSimilarly, we were all amazed that we had a QA environment available\n\nthat matched Dev so early in the project. That, too, was unprecedented. We\n\nneeded to make a bunch of adjustments to reflect that the Dev systems had\n\nconsiderably less memory and storage than QA, and QA had less than those\n\nin Production. But the vast majority of the environments were identical and\n\ncould be modified and spun up in minutes.\n\nAutomated code deployments weren’t quite working yet, nor was the\n\nmigration of code among the environments, but William’s team had demoed\n\nenough of those capabilities that we all had confidence that they’d have it\n\nnailed down soon.\n\nOn top of that, the developers had hit their feature sprint goals ahead of\n\nschedule. They generated reports showing “customers who bought this\n\nproduct bought these other products.” The reports were taking hundreds of\n\ntimes longer than expected, but they promised that they could improve\n\nperformance.\n\nBecause of our rapid progress, we decided to shrink the sprint interval to\n\ntwo weeks. By doing this, we could reduce our planning horizon, to make\n\nand execute decisions more frequently, as opposed to sticking to a plan\n\nmade almost a month ago.\n\nPhoenix continues to operate on a plan written over three years ago. I try\n\nnot to think about that too much.\n\nOur progress seemed to be improving exponentially. We’re planning and\n\nexecuting faster than ever, and the velocity gap between Unicorn and\n\nPhoenix keeps getting larger. The Phoenix teams are taking notice and\n\nstarting to borrow practices left and right and getting results that we hadn’t\n\nthought possible.\n\nUnicorn momentum seems unstoppable and now has a life of its own. I\n\ndoubt we could have made them stop and go back to the old way, even if we\n\nwanted to.\n\nWhile I’m in the middle of a budgeting meeting, Wes calls. “We’ve got a big\n\nproblem.”\n\nStepping out of the room, I say, “What’s up?”\n\n“No one has been able to find Brent for the last two days. You have any\n\nidea where he is?” he asks.\n\n“No,” I reply. “Wait, what do you mean you can’t find him? Is he okay?\n\nYou’ve tried his cell phone, right?”\n\nWes doesn’t bother hiding his exasperation. “Of course I called his cell\n\nphone! I’ve been leaving voicemails for him hourly. Everyone is trying to\n\nfind him. We’ve got work up the wazoo, and his team mates are starting to\n\nfreak out that—holy crap, it’s Brent calling… Hang on…“\n\nI hear him pick up his desk phone, saying, “Where the hell have you\n\nbeen? Everyone is looking for you! No… No… Des Moines? What are you\n\ndoing there? Nobody told me… A secret mission for Dick and Sarah? What\n\nthe fuck—”\n\nI listen to him for a couple of moments with some amusement as Wes\n\nattempts to get to the bottom of the situation with Brent. Finally I hear him\n\nsay, “Hang on a second. Let me find out what Bill wants to do…” as he\n\npicks up his cell phone again.\n\n“Okay, you must have heard some of that, right?” he says to me.\n\n“Tell him I’m calling him right now.”\n\nAfter I hang up, I dial up Brent, wondering what Sarah has done now.\n\n“Hi, Bill,” I hear him say.\n\n“Mind telling me what’s going on and why you’re in Des Moines?” I\n\nask politely.\n\n“Nobody from Dick’s office told you?” he asks. When I don’t say\n\nanything, he continues, “Dick and the finance team rushed me out the door\n\nyesterday morning to be a part of a task force to create a plan to split up the\n\ncompany. Apparently, this is a top priority project, and they need to figure\n\nout what the implications to all the IT systems are.”\n\n“And why did Dick put you on the team?” I ask.\n\n“I don’t know,” he replies. “Trust me, I don’t want to be here. I hate\n\nairplanes. They should have one of their business analysts doing this, but\n\nmaybe it’s because I know the most about how the major systems connect\n\nto one another, where they all reside, all the services they depend on… By\n\nthe way, I can tell you right now that splitting up the company will be a\n\ncomplete nightmare.”\n\nI remember when I led the acquisition integration team when we\n\nacquired the large retailer. That was a huge project. Splitting the company\n\nup may be even more difficult.\n\nIf this is going to impact every one of the hundreds of applications we\n\nsupport, Brent is probably right. It will take years.\n\nIT is everywhere, so it’s not like cutting off a limb. It’s more like\n\nsplitting up the nervous system of the company.\n\nRemembering that Dick and Sarah yanked one of my key resources\n\naway from me without even asking, I say slowly and deliberately, “Brent,\n\nlisten carefully: Your most important priority is to find out what your\n\nUnicorn teammates need and get it to them. Miss your flight if you have to.\n\nI’ll make some phone calls, but there’s a good chance that my assistant\n\nEllen will book you a return flight home tonight. Do you understand?”\n\n“You want me to deliberately miss my flight,” he says.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What will I tell Dick and Sarah?” he asks, uncertainly.\n\nI think for a moment. “Tell them I need you on an emergency call, and\n\nthat you’ll catch up with them.”\n\n“Okay…” he says. “What’s going on here?”\n\n“It’s simple, Brent,” I explain. “Unicorn is the one last hope we have of\n\nhitting our quarterly number. One more blown quarter, and the board will\n\nsurely split the company apart, and you’ll be able to help the task force\n\nthen. But if we hit our numbers, we have a shot at keeping the company\n\ntogether. That’s why Unicorn is our absolute highest priority. Steve was\n\nvery clear on this.”\n\nBrent says dubiously, “Okay. Just tell me where to go, and I’ll be there.\n\nI’ll leave you to argue with the mucky-mucks.” He is clearly annoyed by\n\nthe mixed signals being sent to him.\n\nBut not nearly as annoyed as I am.\n\nI call Steve’s assistant Stacy and tell her I’m on my way.\n\nAs I make my trek to Building 2 to find Steve, I call Wes.\n\n“You did what?” he chortles. “Just great. You’re now in the middle of a\n\npolitical battle with Steve on one side and Dick and Sarah on the other.\n\nAnd, quite frankly, I’m not sure you chose the winning side.”\n\nAfter a moment, he says, “You really think Steve is going to back us up\n\non this one?”\n\nI suppress a sigh. “I sure hope so. If we don’t get Brent back full-time,\n\nUnicorn is sunk. And that probably means that we’ll get a new CEO, get\n\noutsourced, and also figure out how to split up the company. That sound\n\nlike a fun job to you?”\n\nI hang up and walk into Steve’s office. He smiles wanly and says,\n\n“Good morning. Stacy says you have some bad news for me.”\n\nAs I tell him what I learned during my phone call with Brent, I’m\n\nsurprised to see his face turn scarlet. I would have thought he knew about\n\nall of this, given that he’s the CEO.\n\nObviously not.\n\nAfter a moment, he finally says, “The board assured me that they\n\nwouldn’t go further down the company breakup path until we see how this\n\nquarter turns out. I suppose they ran out of patience.”\n\nHe continues, “So tell me what the impact is to Unicorn if Brent gets\n\nreassigned.”\n\n“I’ve talked with Chris, Wes, and Patty,” I reply. “Project Unicorn would\n\nbe completely sunk. I’m a skeptical guy by nature, but I really think\n\nUnicorn is going to work. With Thanksgiving only two weeks away, Brent\n\nowns a significant portion of getting the capabilities we need built. And by\n\nthe way, many of the breakthroughs we’re making are starting to be copied\n\nby the Phoenix team, which is fantastic.”\n\nTo underscore my point, I say with finality, “Without Brent, we will not\n\nbe able to hit any of the sales and profit goals that we’ve tied to Unicorn.\n\nNo chance.”\n\nPursing his lips, Steve asks, “And what happens if you backfill Brent\n\nwith your next best guy?”\n\nI relay to Steve what Wes told me, which mirrored my own thinking.\n\n“Brent is very unique. Unicorn needs someone who has the respect of the\n\ndevelopers, has enough deep experience with almost every sort of IT\n\ninfrastructure we have, and can describe what the developers need to build\n\nso that we can actually manage and operate in production. Those skills are\n\nrare, and we don’t have anyone else that can rotate into this special role\n\nright now.”\n\n“And what if you assign your next best person to Dick’s task force?” he\n\nasks.\n\n“I’d guess that the breakup planning won’t be as accurate but could still\n\nget completed just fine,” I reply.\n\nSteve leans back in his chair, saying nothing.\n\nFinally he says, “Get Brent back here. I’ll handle the rest.”\n\nChapter 33 • Tuesday , November 11\n\nBy the next day, Brent is back on Unicorn, and one of the level 3 engineers\n\nhas joined Dick’s team somewhere in the snowy Midwest. Within hours, I\n\nget copied on an e-mail from Sarah:\n\nFrom: Sarah Moulton\n\nTo: Bob Strauss\n\nCc: Dick Landry, Steve Masters, Bill Palmer\n\nDate: November 11, 7:24 AM\n\nSubject: Someone is undermining Project Talon\n\nBob, I’ve discovered that Bill Palmer, the acting VP of IT\n\nOperations, stole the critical resource for Project Talon.\n\nBill, I’m deeply concerned with your recent actions. Please\n\nexplain to us why you ordered Brent to return home? This is\n\nabsolutely intolerable. The board has instructed us to explore strategic\n\noptions.\n\nI demand that Brent rejoin the Talon team as soon as possible.\n\nPlease confirm you understand this message.\n\nSarah\n\nGenuinely alarmed that I’m being called out on an e-mail to the\n\ncompany chairman, I call Steve, who is obviously furious at Sarah’s\n\napparent change in loyalties. After swearing under his breath, he assures me\n\nthat he’ll handle this and that I am to continue as planned.",

      "content": "At the daily Unicorn stand-up meeting, William doesn’t look happy.\n\n“The good news is that as of last night, we’ve generated our first customer\n\npromotion report and it appears to be working correctly. But the code is\n\nrunning fifty times slower than we expected. One of the clustering\n\nalgorithms isn’t parallelizing like we thought it would, so the prediction\n\nruns are already taking more than twenty-four hours, even for our small\n\ncustomer data set test.”\n\nGrumbles and groans go around the room.\n\nOne of the developers says, “Can’t we just use brute force? Just throw\n\nmore hardware at the problem. With enough compute servers, we can bring\n\nthe run times down.”\n\n“Are you kidding me?” Wes says, with exasperation. “We only budgeted\n\nfor twenty of the fastest servers we could find. You’d need over a thousand\n\nservers to get the run times down to where we need. That’s over $1 million\n\nin unbudgeted capital!”\n\nI purse my lips. Wes is right. Phoenix is way over budget as it is, and\n\nwe’re talking about a large enough amount of money that it’ll be impossible\n\nto get this approved, especially given our financial condition.\n\n“We don’t need any new hardware,” the developer replies. “We’ve\n\ninvested all this effort to create compute images that we can deploy. Why\n\nnot send them out to the cloud? We could spin up hundreds or thousands of\n\ncompute instances as we need them, tear them down when we’re done, and\n\njust pay for the compute time we use.”\n\nWes looks at Brent, who says, “It’s possible. We’re already using\n\nvirtualization for most of our environments. It shouldn’t be very difficult to\n\nconvert them so that they run on a cloud computing provider.”\n\nAfter a moment, he adds, “You know, that would be fun. I’ve always\n\nwanted to try something like this.”\n\nBrent’s excitement is contagious.\n\nWe start assigning tasks to investigate its feasibility. Brent teams up with\n\nthe developer who had suggested the idea to do a quick prototype, to see\n\nwhether it is even possible.\n\nMaggie, who has taken such an interest in Unicorn that she’s routinely\n\nattending the daily stand-ups, volunteers to look into pricing and will call\n\nher peers in the industry to see if any of them have done this before and to\n\nget any recommended vendors.\n\nOne of John’s security engineers interrupts, “Sending our customer data\n\nto the cloud may have some risks like accidental disclosure of private data\n\nor someone unauthorized hacking into those compute servers.”\n\n“Good thinking,” I say. “Can you list your top risks we should be\n\nthinking about, and prepare a list of potential countermeasures and\n\ncontrols?”\n\nHe smiles in response, happy to be asked. One of the developers\n\nvolunteers to work with him.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, I’m surprised at the unanticipated payoffs of\n\nautomating our deployment process. The developers can more quickly scale\n\nthe application, and potentially few changes would be required from us.\n\nDespite this, I’m extremely dubious of all this cloud computing\n\nhullabaloo. People treat it as if it’s some sort of magical elixir that\n\ninstantaneously reduces costs. In my mind, it’s just another form of\n\noutsourcing.\n\nBut if it solves a problem we’re having, I’m willing to give it a try. I\n\nremind Wes to keep an open mind, as well.\n\nA week later, once again, it’s demo time. We’re all standing in the Unicorn\n\nteam area. It’s the end of the sprint, and the Development lead is eager to\n\nshow off what the team has accomplished.\n\n“I can hardly believe how much we got done,” he starts off. “Because of\n\nall the deployment automation, getting compute instances running in the\n\ncloud wasn’t as hard as we thought. In fact, it’s working so well that we’re\n\nconsidering turning all the in-house Unicorn production systems into test\n\nsystems and using the cloud for all our production systems.\n\n“We start the recommendations reporting run every evening and spin up\n\nhundreds of compute instances until we’re done, and then we turn them off.\n\nWe’ve been doing this for the past four days, and it’s working well—really\n\nwell.”\n\nBrent has a wide smile on this face, as does the rest of the team.\n\nNext up is usually the product manager, but this time Maggie is\n\npresenting instead. She’s obviously taking more than just casual interest in\n\nthis project.\n\nShe pulls up a PowerPoint slide on the projector. “These are the Unicorn\n\npromotions generated for my customer account. As you can see, it’s looked\n\nat my buying history and is letting me know that snow tires and batteries\n\nare fifteen percent off. I actually went to our website and purchased both,\n\nbecause I need them. The company just made money, because those are all\n\nitems that we have excess inventory and high profit margins.”\n\nI smile. Now that’s brilliant.\n\n“And, here are the Unicorn promotions for Wes,” she continues, going\n\nto the next slide, with a smile. “Looks like you got a discount on racing\n\nbrake pads and fuel additives. That of any interest to you?”\n\nWes smiles. “Not bad!”\n\nMaggie explains that all these offers are already in the Phoenix system,\n\nand it was just waiting for the promotion functionality to finally get them to\n\nthe customers.\n\nShe continues, “Here’s my proposal: I’d like to do an e-mail campaign\n\nto one percent of our customers, to see what happens. Thanksgiving is in\n\none week. If we could do a couple of trials and everything goes well, we’d\n\ngo full blast on Black Friday, which is the busiest shopping day of the\n\nyear.”\n\n“Sounds like a good plan,” I say. “Wes, is there any reason why we\n\nshouldn’t do this?”\n\nWes shakes his head. “From an Ops perspective, I can’t think of any. All\n\nthe hard work has already been done. If Chris, William, and Marketing have\n\nconfidence that the code is working, I say go for it.”\n\nEveryone agrees. There are some issues that come up, but Maggie says\n\nher team is willing to work all night to make it happen.\n\nI smile inwardly. For once, it won’t be just us staying up all night\n\nbecause something went really wrong. In fact, it’s the exact opposite.\n\nPeople are staying up all night because everything was going right.\n\nThe following Monday, it’s barely above freezing as I’m driving to work,\n\nbut the sun is shining brightly. It looks like it’s going to be a great week for\n\nthe upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. Throughout the weekend, I’m a bit\n\nstartled to see commercials with Santa Claus in them.\n\nWhen I get to my office, I throw my heavy coat over my chair. I turn\n\nwhen I hear Patty walk into my office and see that she has a broad smile on\n\nher face. “Did you hear the amazing news from Marketing?”\n\nWhen I shake my head, she merely says, “Read the e-mail that Maggie\n\njust sent out.”\n\nI flip open my laptop and read:\n\nFrom: Maggie Lee\n\nTo: Chris Allers, Bill Palmer\n\nCc: Steve Masters, Wes Davis, Sarah Moulton\n\nDate: November 24, 7:47 AM\n\nSubject: First Unicorn promotion campaign: UNBELIEVABLE!\n\nThe Marketing team burned the midnight oil over the weekend\n\nand we were able to do a test campaign to one percent of our\n\ncustomers.\n\nThe results were STELLAR! Over twenty percent of the respondents\n\nwent to our website, and over six percent purchased. These are\n\nincredibly high conversion rates—probably over 5× higher than any\n\ncampaign we’ve done before.\n\nWe recommend doing a Unicorn promotion to all our customers\n\non Thanksgiving Day. I’m working to get a dashboard up so everyone\n\ncan see real-time results of the Unicorn campaigns.\n\nAlso, remember that all the items being promoted are high margin\n\nitems, so the effects on our bottom line will be excellent.\n\nPS: Bill, based on the results, we expect a huge surge in web\n\ntraffic. Can we make sure the website won’t fall over?\n\nGreat work, all!\n\nMaggie\n\n“I love it,” I say to Patty. “Work with Wes to figure out what we need to\n\ndo to handle the surge in traffic. We’ve only got three days to get this done,\n\nso we don’t have much time. We don’t want to screw this up and turn\n\nprospective customers into haters.”\n\nShe nods and is about to respond when her phone vibrates. An instant\n\nlater, my phone vibrates, too. She quickly looks down and says, “The\n\ndragon lady strikes again.”\n\n“I wish I had an ‘unsubscribe’ button for her e-mails,” Patty says as she\n\nwalks out.\n\nA half hour later, Steve sent out a congratulatory note to the entire\n\nUnicorn team, which everyone loved reading. More surprisingly, he also\n\nsent out a public reply to Sarah, demanding that she stop “stirring the pot\n\nand making trouble” and to “see me at your earliest convenience.”\n\nThat still didn’t stop all the public e-mails going back and forth among\n\nSarah, Steve, and Bob. Seeing Sarah toadying up to our new chairman, Bob,\n\nwas awkward and uncomfortable. It’s like Sarah didn’t even care how\n\nobvious she was being and all the bridges she was burning.\n\nI walk into a meeting room to meet John about the resolution of all the\n\nSOX-404 and Unicorn security issues. He’s wearing a pin-striped Oxford\n\nshirt and a vest, complete with cufflinks. He looks like he just came out of a\n\nVanity Fair photo shoot, and I guess he’s continuing to shave his head daily.\n\n“I’m amazed at how quickly the Unicorn security fixes are being\n\nintegrated,” he says. “Compared to the rest of Phoenix, fixing Unicorn\n\nsecurity issues is a breeze. The cycle time is so short, we once put in a fix\n\nwithin an hour. More typically, we can get fixes in within a day or two.\n\nCompared to this, remediating Phoenix issues is like pulling our own teeth\n\nout, without any anesthesia. Normally, we’d have to wait for a quarter for\n\nany meaningful changes to be made, and jumping through all the hoops\n\nrequired to get an emergency change order through was almost not worth\n\nthe trouble.\n\n“Really,” he continues, “patching is so easy, because we can rebuild\n\nanything in production with a touch of a button. If it breaks, we can build it\n\nagain from scratch.”\n\nI nod. “I’m amazed at the what we can do with the fast Unicorn cycle\n\ntimes, too. With Phoenix, we only rehearsed and practiced doing the\n\ndeployments once per quarter. Just in the last five weeks, we’ve done over\n\ntwenty Unicorn code and environment deployments. It almost feels routine.\n\nAs you said, it’s the opposite of Phoenix.”\n\nJohn says, “Most of the reservations I had about Unicorn don’t seem\n\nvalid anymore. We’ve put in regular checks to make sure that the\n\ndevelopers who have daily access to production only have read-only access,\n\nand we’re making good progress on integrating our security tests into the\n\nbuild procedures. I’m pretty confident that any changes that could affect\n\ndata security or the authentication modules will get caught quickly.”\n\nHe leans back, crossing his arms behind his head. “I was scared shitless\n\nof how we’d gain any sort of assurance about securing Unicorn. It’s partly\n\nbecause we’re so used to taking a month to turn around application security\n\nreview. In an emergency, like in response to a high-priority audit, we could\n\nsometimes turn things around in a week.\n\n“But the notion of having to keep up with ten deploys a day?” he\n\ncontinues. “Complete lunacy! But after being forced to automate our\n\nsecurity testing, and integrating it into the same process that William uses\n\nfor his automated QA testing, we’re testing every time a developer commits\n\ncode. In many ways, we now have better visibility and code coverage than\n\nany of the other applications in the company!”\n\nHe adds, “You should know that we just closed out the last of the SOX-\n\n404 issues. We were able to prove to the auditors, thanks in large part to the\n\nnew change control processes you put in, that all the current controls are\n\nsufficient, closing out the three-year repeat audit finding.”\n\nWith a smile, he adds, “Congratulations, Bill. You’ve done what none of\n\nyour predecessors have been able to do, which is to finally get the auditors\n\noff our back!”\n\nMuch to my surprise, the short week goes smoothly. Before everyone\n\nleaves on Wednesday for the Thanksgiving holiday, the big Unicorn\n\ncampaign is ready. Code performance is still ten times slower than we need,\n\nbut we’re okay for now because we can just spin up hundreds of compute\n\ninstances in the cloud.\n\nWe had a genuine showstopper when QA discovered that we were\n\nrecommending items that were out of stock. That would have been\n\ndisastrous, as customers would excitedly click on the promotion, only to\n\nfind them listed as “backordered.” Incredibly, Development developed a fix\n\nwithin a day, and it was deployed within an hour.\n\nIt’s 6 p.m. and I pack up my stuff, looking forward to the long weekend.\n\nWe’ve all earned it.\n\nChapter 34 • Friday, November 28\n\nBy midday Thursday, right in the middle of Thanksgiving, we knew we\n\nwere in trouble. The overnight Unicorn e-mail promotion was an incredible\n\nsuccess. The response rate was unprecedentedly high, with traffic to our\n\nwebsite surging to record levels, which kept bringing down our e-commerce\n\nsystems.\n\nWe initiated an emergency Sev 1 call, putting in all sorts of emergency\n\nmeasures to maintain our ability to take orders, including putting more\n\nservers into rotation and turning off computationally-intensive features.\n\nIronically, one of the developers suggested turning off all the real-time\n\nrecommendations, which we had worked so hard to build. Why recommend\n\nmore products to buy, he argued, if customers can’t even complete a\n\ntransaction?\n\nMaggie quickly agreed, but it still took the developers two hours to\n\nchange and deploy. Now, this feature can be disabled with a configuration\n\nsetting, so we can do it in minutes next time around, instead of requiring a\n\nfull code rollout.\n\nNow that’s what I call designing for IT Operations! It’s getting easier\n\nand easier to manage the code in production.\n\nWe also kept optimizing database queries and moving the largest site\n\ngraphics to a third-party content distribution network, offloading more\n\ntraffic from our servers. By late Thanksgiving afternoon, the customer\n\nexperience had improved to something tolerable.",

      "content": "The real trouble began the following morning. Although it is an official\n\ncompany holiday, I’ve called everyone one of my staff back into the office.\n\nWes, Patty, Brent, and Maggie are here for the noon meeting. Chris is\n\nhere, but has apparently decided that being called in today demanded a\n\ndifferent dress code. He’s wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt and jeans and has\n\nbrought in coffee and doughnuts for everyone.\n\nMaggie convened the meeting a couple of minutes ago. “This morning,\n\nour store managers opened up their locations for Black Friday. From the\n\nmoment they opened the doors, people poured in, waving around printouts\n\nof their Unicorn promotion e-mails. In-store traffic today is at record levels.\n\nThe problem is that the promoted items are now almost completely gone.\n\nOur store managers started panicking because customers were leaving\n\nangry and empty-handed.\n\n“When store managers try to issue rain checks or get an item shipped to\n\nthe customer, they’re having to manually key in the order from our\n\nwarehouse. It’s taking them at least fifteen minutes per order, which is\n\nresulting in long lines at the stores and more frustrated customers.”\n\nJust then, the speakerphone on the table beeps. “Sarah dialing in. Who’s\n\non the line?”\n\nMaggie rolls her eyes, and several other people mutter to one another.\n\nSarah’s attempts to undermine Unicorn are well known now. Maggie has to\n\ntake two minutes to announce everyone on the call and catch her up.\n\n“Thank you,” Sarah says. “I’ll remain on the call. Please continue.”\n\nMaggie thanks her politely and begins brainstorming on how to solve\n\nthe problems.\n\nAn hour later, we generated twenty actions we’ll be tackling all\n\nweekend long. We’ll be putting up a web page for store personnel where\n\nthey can type in the coupon promotion code, which will automate the cross-\n\nshipment from our warehouses. In addition, we’ll create a new form on the\n\ncustomer account web page where they can get items delivered directly to\n\nthem.\n\nIt’s a long list.\n\nBy Monday morning, the situation has stabilized. Which is good,\n\nbecause we have our weekly Unicorn meeting with Steve.\n\nChris, Wes, Patty, and John are here. Unlike our previous meetings,\n\nSarah is here, too. She sits with her arms crossed, occasionally uncrossing\n\nthem to tap out messages to someone on her iPhone.\n\nSteve says to all of us with a wide smile, “I want to congratulate you for\n\nall your hard work. It has paid off beyond my wildest expectations. Thanks\n\nto Unicorn, both in-store and web sales are breaking records, resulting in\n\nrecord weekly revenue. At the current run rate, Marketing estimates that\n\nwe’ll hit profitability this quarter. It will be our first profitable quarter since\n\nthe middle of last year.\n\n“My heartiest congratulations to you all,” he says.\n\nEveryone except Sarah smiles at the news.\n\n“That’s only half the story, Steve,” Chris says. “The Unicorn team is\n\nkicking butt. They’ve moved from doing deployments every two weeks to\n\nevery week, and we’re now experimenting with doing daily deployments.\n\nBecause the batch size is so much smaller, we can make small changes very\n\nquickly. We’re now doing A/B testing all the time. In short, we’ve never\n\nbeen able to respond to the market this quickly, and I’m sure there are more\n\nrabbits we can pull out of this hat.”\n\nI nod emphatically. “I suspect we’ll want to follow the Unicorn model\n\nfor any new applications we develop internally. It’s easier to scale, as well\n\nas easier to manage, than any application we’ve supported in the past.\n\nWe’re setting up the processes and procedures so that we can deploy at\n\nwhatever rate it takes to quickly respond to customers. In some cases, we’re\n\neven enabling developers to deploy the code. The developer will be able to\n\npush a button and within several minutes, the code will be in the testing\n\nenvironment or in production.”\n\n“I can’t believe how far we’ve come in such a short time. I’m proud of\n\nall of you,” Steve says. “I want to commend you for truly working together\n\nand being worthy of one another’s trust.”\n\n“Better late than never, I suppose,” Sarah says. “If we’re done\n\ncongratulating ourselves, I’ve got a business wake-up call for you. Earlier\n\nthis month, our largest retail competitor started partnering with their\n\nmanufacturers to allow custom build-to-order kits. Sales of some our top\n\nselling items are already down twenty percent since they launched this\n\noffering.”\n\nAngrily, she adds, “For years, I’ve been trying to get IT to build out the\n\ninfrastructure to enable this capability, but all we heard was, ‘no, it can’t be\n\ndone.’ Meanwhile, our competition has been able to work with any\n\nmanufacturer who says yes.”\n\nShe adds, “That’s why Bob’s idea of splitting up the company has so\n\nmuch merit. We’re being shackled by the legacy manufacturing side of this\n\nbusiness.”\n\nWhat? Buying the retail firm was her idea! Maybe life would have been\n\neasier for everyone if she had just gone to work for a retailer.\n\nSteve frowns. “This is the next agenda item. As SVP of Retail\n\nOperations, it’s Sarah’s prerogative to bring business needs and risks to this\n\nteam.”\n\nWes snorts. To Sarah, he says, “You’re kidding, right? Do you\n\nunderstand what we just achieved with Unicorn, and how fast we did it?\n\nWhat you’re describing isn’t that difficult, compared to what we just pulled\n\noff.”\n\nThe next day, Wes walks in wearing an uncharacteristically glum face. “Uh,\n\nboss. I hate to say it, but I don’t think it can be done.”\n\nWhen I ask him to explain, he says, “To do what our competitor is\n\ndoing, we’d have to completely rewrite our manufacturing resource\n\nplanning system that supports all the plants. It’s an old mainframe\n\napplication that we’ve used for decades. We outsourced it three years ago.\n\nMostly because old people like you were going to retire soon.\n\n“No offense,” he adds. “We laid off many of our mainframe people\n\nyears ago—they were making salaries way above the norm. Some\n\noutsourcer convinced our CIO at the time that they had the gray-haired\n\nworkforce that could keep our application on life-support until we retired it.\n\nOur plan was that we would replace with a newer ERP system, but\n\nobviously, we never got around to it.”\n\n“Dammit, we’re the customer and they’re our supplier,” I say. “Tell\n\nthem that we’re paying them not just to maintain the application but also to\n\nmake any needed business changes. According to Sarah, we need this\n\nchange. So find out how much they want to charge us and how long we’ll\n\nhave to wait.”\n\n“I did that,” Wes says, pulling out a ream of paper from under his arm.\n\n“Here’s the proposal they finally sent after I managed to get the damned\n\naccount manager out of the way so I could actually talk to one of the\n\ntechnical analysts.\n\n“They want six months to gather the requirements, another nine months\n\nto develop and test, and if we’re lucky, we might be able to put it into\n\nproduction one year from now,” he continues. “The problem is, the\n\nresources we need aren’t available until June. So, we’re talking about\n\neighteen months. Minimum. To even start the process, they would need\n\n$50K for the feasibility study and to secure a slot in their development\n\nschedule.”\n\nWes is bright red now, shaking his head. “That worthless account\n\nmanager keeps insisting that the contract just won’t allow him to help us.\n\nBastard. Obviously, his job is to make sure that everything that can be billed\n\nfor is, and to dissuade us from doing anything not on the contract, like\n\ndevelopment.”\n\nI exhale loudly, thinking through the implications. The constraint\n\npreventing us from going where we need to go is now outside our\n\norganization. But if it’s outside the organization, what can we possibly do?\n\nWe can’t convince an outsourcer to change their priorities or their\n\nmanagement practices as we’ve done.\n\nSuddenly, a glimmer of an idea hits me.\n\n“How many people do they have allocated to our account?” I ask.\n\n“I don’t know,” Wes says. “I think there are six people assigned at thirty\n\npercent allocation. It probably depends on their role.”\n\n“Get Patty in here, along with a copy of the contract, and let’s work\n\nthrough the math. And see if you can grab someone from Purchasing, too. I\n\nhave an audacious proposal that I’d like to explore.”\n\n“Who outsourced the MRP application?” Steve asks from behind his desk.\n\nI’m sitting in Steve’s office with Chris, Wes, and Patty, with Sarah\n\nstanding off to the side, whom I try to ignore.\n\nI explain our idea to Steve again. “Many years ago, we decided that this\n\napplication wasn’t a critical part of the business, so we outsourced it to cut\n\ncosts. Obviously, they didn’t view it as a core competency.”\n\n“Well, it’s obviously a core competency now!” replies Steve. “Right\n\nnow, that damned outsourcer is holding us hostage, preventing us from\n\ndoing something that needs to be done. They’re more than just a roadblock.\n\nThey’re now jeopardizing our future.”\n\nI nod. “In short, we’d like to break the outsourcing contract early,\n\nbringing those resources back into the company. We’re talking about\n\napproximately six people, some of whom are still onsite. To buy out the\n\nremainder of the contract two years early would be almost one million\n\ndollars, and we would regain complete control of the MRP application and\n\nunderlying infrastructure. Everyone on this team believes this is the right\n\nthing to do, and we’ve even got the initial blessing from Dick’s team.”\n\nI hold my breath. I just threw out a very a big number. It’s considerably\n\nbigger than the budget increase I asked for two months ago when I got\n\nthrown out of this office.\n\nI quickly continue, “Chris believes that once this MRP application is back\n\nin-house, we could build an interface to Unicorn. We would then start\n\nbuilding the manufacturing capability to move us from ‘build to inventory’\n\nto ‘build to order,’ which would enable us to provide the custom kits as\n\nSarah requested. If we execute everything flawlessly, and the integration\n\nwith the order entry and inventory management systems goes as planned,\n\nwe could match what our competitors are doing in about ninety days.”\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I can see the wheels turning furiously in\n\nSarah’s head.\n\nSteve doesn’t shoot down the idea down right away. “Okay, you have\n\nmy attention. What are the top risks?”\n\nChris takes this one. “The outsourcer may have made big changes to the\n\ncode base that we don’t know about, which would slow down the\n\ndevelopment schedule. But my personal belief is that this risk is minimal.\n\nBased on their behavior, I don’t think they made any significant changes to\n\nfunctionality.\n\n“I’m not worried about the technical challenges,” he continues. “The\n\nMRP was not designed for large batch sizes and certainly not batch sizes of\n\none that we’re talking about here. But I’m sure we can make something\n\nwork short-term and figure out a long-term strategy as we go.”\n\nWhen Chris finishes, Patty adds, “The outsourcer could also decide to\n\nmake the transition back to us difficult, and there could be animosity from\n\nthe affected engineers. There were a lot of hard feelings when we\n\nannounced the contract—among other things, their pay was cut the instant\n\nthey switched from being Parts Unlimited employees to being a vendor.”\n\nShe continues. “We should get John involved right away, because we’ll\n\nneed to take away access from all the outsourcer staff that we’re not\n\nbringing back in.”\n\nWes laughs, saying, “I’d like to personally delete the login credentials of\n\nthat jackass account manager. He’s a jerk.”\n\nSteve is listening attentively. He then turns to Sarah and asks, “Your\n\nthoughts on the team’s proposal?”\n\nShe says nothing for several moments but eventually says imperiously,\n\n“I think we need to check with Bob Strauss and get full board approval\n\nbefore we undertake a project this big and risky. Given the previous\n\nperformance of IT, this could jeopardize all of our manufacturing\n\noperations, which is more risk than I think we should take on. In short, I\n\npersonally do not support this proposal.”\n\nSteve studies Sarah, saying with a thin-lipped smile, “Remember that\n\nyou work for me, not Bob. If you can’t work within that arrangement, I will\n\nneed your immediate resignation.”\n\nSarah turns white, her jaw dropping, obviously realizing she’s badly\n\nmisplayed her hand.\n\nStruggling to regain her composure, she laughs nervously at Steve’s\n\ncomment, but no one else joins in. I furtively look at my colleagues, and see\n\nthat, like me, their eyes are wide, watching this drama unfold.\n\nSteve continues, “On the contrary, thanks to IT, we may no longer need\n\nto consider all the onerous strategic options that you and Bob are preparing,\n\nbut your point is well taken.”\n\nTo the rest of us, Steve says, “I’m assigning you one of Dick’s best\n\npeople and our corporate counsel. They’ll help you flawlessly execute this\n\nproject and make sure we use every trick in the book to get what we need\n\nfrom the outsourcer. I’ll make sure Dick gives this project his personal\n\nattention.”\n\nSarah’s eyes widen even further. “That’s an excellent idea, Steve. That\n\nwould significantly reduce our risk here. I think Bob will really like it.”\n\nThe expression on Steve’s face suggests that his patience for her\n\ntheatrics is nearly at an end.\n\nHe asks us if there’s anything else we need. When there isn’t, he excuses\n\neveryone but asks Sarah to remain behind.\n\nAs we leave, I sneak a peek behind us. Sarah is sitting down where I\n\npreviously sat, nervously watching everyone file out. Catching her eye, I\n\nsmile at her and close the door.\n\nChapter 35 • Friday, January 9\n\nI grip the steering wheel nervously as I drive to Steve’s house. He’s\n\nthrowing a party for everyone who has worked so hard on Phoenix and\n\nUnicorn, inviting people from both the business and IT. The roads are\n\nuncharacteristically icy, with no melting even after weeks of sunshine. It\n\nwas treacherous enough that Paige and I decided to stay at home for New\n\nYear’s Eve instead of celebrating with her family as we usually do.\n\nIt’s been over a month since that last meeting with Steve and Sarah. We\n\nhaven’t seen much of Sarah since then.\n\nAs I’m driving, I contemplate how quiet it’s been. I keep expecting\n\nsomeone to call in another Sev 1 incident. Instead, my phone just sits in the\n\ncup holder, completely silent—like yesterday—and the day before that.\n\nI can’t say that I miss all of the excitement, but there are times now\n\nwhen I literally have nothing to do.\n\nThankfully, I’m now coaching all my managers through our two-week\n\nimprovement cycles, according to the Improvement Kata, which keeps me\n\nfrom feeling totally useless. I’m especially proud that for an entire month,\n\nmy group hit our target of spending fifteen percent of our time on\n\npreventive infrastructure projects. And it shows.\n\nWe’re using the entire budget we’ve been allocated. We’re closing our\n\nmonitoring gaps, we’ve refactored or replaced our top ten fragile artifacts\n\nso that they’re more stable, and the flow of planned work is faster than ever.\n\nAgainst my expectations, everyone jumped enthusiastically on Project\n\nNarwhal otherwise known as the “Simian Army Chaos Monkey” project.",

      "content": "Like the legendary stories of the original Apple Mac OS and Netflix cloud\n\ndelivery infrastructure, we deployed code that routinely created large-scale\n\nfaults, thus randomly killing processes or entire servers.\n\nOf course, the result was all hell breaking loose for an entire week as\n\nour test, and occasionally, production infrastructure crashed like a house of\n\ncards. But, over the following weeks, as Development and IT Operations\n\nworked together to make our code and infrastructure more resilient to\n\nfailures, we truly had IT services that were resilient, rugged, and durable.\n\nJohn loved this, and started a new project called “Evil Chaos Monkey.”\n\nInstead of generating operational faults in production, it would constantly\n\ntry to exploit security holes, fuzz our applications with storms of malformed\n\npackets, try to install backdoors, gain access to confidential data, and all\n\nsorts of other nefarious attacks.\n\nOf course, Wes tried to stop this. He insisted that we schedule\n\npenetration tests into predefined time frames. However, I convinced him\n\nthis is the fastest means to institutionalize Erik’s Third Way. We need to\n\ncreate a culture that reinforces the value of taking risks and learning from\n\nfailure and the need for repetition and practice to create mastery.\n\nI don’t want posters about quality and security. I want improvement of\n\nour daily work showing up where it needs to be: in our daily work.\n\nJohn’s team developed tools that stress-tested every test and production\n\nenvironment with a continual barrage of attacks. And like when we first\n\nreleased the chaos monkey, immediately over half their time was spent\n\nfixing security holes and hardening the code. After several weeks, the\n\ndevelopers were deservedly proud of their work, successfully fending off\n\neverything that John’s team was able to throw at them.\n\nThese are the thoughts going through my head as I wind my way toward\n\nSteve’s house. The sprawling grounds are all covered by snow, hiding the\n\nimmaculately manicured lawns.\n\nWhen I ring the doorbell an hour early, as Steve requested, I hear loud\n\nbarking and then the sounds of a very large dog slipping on a hardwood\n\nfloor, crashing into the door.\n\n“Come on in, Bill. It’s great seeing you again,” Steve says, holding the\n\ndog’s collar and gesturing toward the kitchen with a skewer of vegetables in\n\nthe other hand. When we get to the kitchen, he points to the counter in front\n\nof him, where a large metal bucket of ice sits, full of bottles. “You want\n\nanything to drink? Beer? Soda? Scotch?” Looking around, he adds,\n\n“Margarita?”\n\nI grab a beer out of the bucket, thank him, and then give him a quick\n\nsummary of my somewhat boring day as he moves me to the living room.\n\nSteve smiles. “Thanks for coming over early. We’re going to have a\n\nrecord-breaking quarter. We couldn’t have done it without you and Chris.\n\nFor the first time in years, our market share is up! You know, I wish I could\n\nsee the looks on our competitors’ faces. They’re probably scrambling,\n\ntrying to figure out how we did it.”\n\nSteve is smiling broadly. “I actually saw Dick crack a smile the other\n\nday. Well, he showed his teeth, at least. Project Unicorn and that new\n\nproject, Narwhal, are helping us understand what are customers actually\n\nwant. Our average order size just hit a record last week, and Dick said that\n\nUnicorn had the fastest payback of any project we’ve done in recent\n\nmemory.”\n\nHe continues, “The analysts are starting to love us again. One told me\n\nlast week that if we execute well, it’ll be very difficult for our nonintegrated\n\ncompetitors to follow us. No doubt, they’ll be raising our stock price\n\ntargets, and Bob is finally withdrawing his support to split up the company.”\n\n“Really?” I say, raising my eyebrows in surprise. “I thought that Sarah\n\nwas convinced that splitting up the company was the only way for us to\n\nsurvive.”\n\n“Ah, yes…” he says. “She’s decided to look for other options elsewhere\n\nand is on a leave of absence.”\n\nMy jaw drops. If I’m hearing this correctly, Sarah is being eased out of\n\nthe company. I smile.\n\n“By the way,” Steve says. “Project Narwhal? Project Unicorn? Can’t\n\nyou guys come up with better names than that?”\n\nI laugh. “No one is more upset about it than Maggie. She’s convinced\n\nthat all her product managers are laughing at her. She’s told her husband\n\nthat if the next project is called ‘Hello Kitty,’ she’ll quit.”\n\nHe laughs. “As you can guess, though, I didn’t ask you to come early to\n\ncritique your project names. Have a seat.”\n\nAs I settle into a cushy armchair, he starts to explain. “We’ve had an\n\nopen position for the CIO for months. You’ve been a part of that interview\n\nprocess. What have you thought of the candidates?”\n\n“Honestly? I was disappointed,” I say slowly. “They were all senior\n\npeople with a lot more experience than me. They kept talking about tiny\n\nparts of the problem. They proposed only a fraction of what we’ve done in\n\nthe past couple of months here at Parts Unlimited. I feel that if they signed\n\non, we’d be at considerable risk of going back to all the bad old ways.”\n\n“I agree with you, Bill. Which is why I’ve decided that we should fill\n\nthis position internally. You have any suggestions on who we should\n\npromote?”\n\nI go through the possible candidates in my mind. It’s not a long list. “I\n\nthink Chris is the obvious choice. He was the driving force behind Unicorn,\n\nas well as Narwhal. If it weren’t for his leadership, I’m pretty sure we’d still\n\nbe stuck dead in the water.”\n\nHe smiles. “You know, it’s funny. Everyone thought you’d say that.\n\nHowever, I won’t be following your recommendations.”\n\nHe continues, “This is going to take a while to explain. You were\n\neveryone’s unanimous choice to become CIO. But to be brutally candid, I\n\ndon’t want you there.”\n\nReacting to my obvious distress, he says, “Hey, relax. Let me explain.\n\nMy board holds me responsible for making the best use of company\n\nresources to achieve the goals that maximize shareholder value. My primary\n\njob is to lead my management team to make that happen.”\n\nHe stands up, walking over to the window, looking out at the snow-\n\ncovered yard. “You’ve helped me see that IT is not merely a department.\n\nInstead, it’s pervasive, like electricity. It’s a skill, like being able to read or\n\ndo math. Here at Parts Unlimited, we don’t have a centralized reading or\n\nmath department—we expect everyone we hire to have some mastery of it.\n\nUnderstanding what technology can and can’t do has become a core\n\ncompetency that every part of this business must have. If any of my\n\nbusiness managers are leading a team or a project without that skill, they\n\nwill fail.”\n\nHe continues, “I need each and every one of my business managers to\n\ntake calculated risks, without jeopardizing the entire enterprise. People\n\neverywhere in the business are using technology, so it’s like the Wild West\n\nagain—for better or for worse. Businesses that can’t learn to compete in this\n\nnew world will perish.”\n\nTurning back to me, he says, “In order for Parts Unlimited to survive,\n\nthe business and IT can’t make decisions exclusive of each other. I don’t\n\nknow where this is all going, but I know the way we’re organized now,\n\nwe’re not firing on all cylinders.\n\n“I’ve been discussing this with my board for the last couple of months,”\n\nhe says, sitting down, staring right at me. I know this expression. It’s like\n\nmy first meeting with him last year. This is what he looks like when he’s\n\ntrying to seduce someone. “I’m impressed with your performance and what\n\nyou’ve done with IT. You used the same skills that I would expect anyone\n\nleading one of our large manufacturing divisions to use.\n\n“Now I want to see you grow and learn, and build new skills to best help\n\nall of Parts Unlimited. If you’re up to it, I am prepared to invest in you. I\n\nwant to put you on a fast track, two-year plan. You’ll do rotations in sales\n\nand marketing, manage a plant, get international experience, manage the\n\nrelationships of our most critical suppliers, and manage our supply chain.\n\nTrust me, this will not be a vacation. You’re going to need help—a lot of it.\n\nErik has kindly agreed to mentor you, because we both believe this will be\n\nthe most difficult thing you’ve ever done.\n\n“But,” he continues, “if you achieve each of fifteen specific\n\nperformance targets we’ve laid out for you, we’ll move you into a\n\nprovisional Chief Operating Officer role in two years, where you’ll work\n\nclosely with Dick while he gets ready to retire. If you work hard, get results\n\nand play your cards right, you’ll be the next COO of the company in three\n\nyears.”\n\nI feel my jaw hanging open, my beer bottle dripping water onto my leg.\n\n“You don’t have to answer now,” he says, obviously satisfied that his\n\npitch is having the desired effect. “Half my board thinks I’m crazy. Maybe\n\nthey’re right, but I trust my instincts. I don’t know how this is going to\n\nshape up, but I have confidence that this is what’s best for the company. My\n\ngut tells me that in ten years, when we’re mopping the last pieces of our\n\ncompetition off the floor, this is the gamble that will have made that\n\npossible.\n\n“While we’re dreaming big dreams here, let me say this,” he continues.\n\n“In ten years, I’m certain every COO worth their salt will have come from IT.\n\nAny COO who doesn’t intimately understand the IT systems that actually run\n\nthe business is just an empty suit, relying on someone else to do their job.”\n\nSteve’s vision takes my breath away. He’s right. Everything my team\n\nhas learned, as well as what Chris and John have learned, shows that when\n\nIT fails, the business fails. It stands to reason that if IT is organized so that it\n\ncan win, the business wins, too.\n\nAnd Steve wants to put me on the vanguard of this movement.\n\nMe. A technology operations guy.\n\nSuddenly, I think of how one of Erik’s higher ups decided to mustang\n\nhim from a senior NCO to a lowly lieutenant, forcing him to climb the ladder\n\nagain from the very bottom of the officer ranks. Obviously, Erik had the\n\ncourage to do it, and the rewards for him (and his family, if he has one)\n\nseem pretty evident. He’s living a life that seems to have transcended our\n\nmortal plane of existence.\n\nAs if Steve knows what I’m thinking, he says, “You know, when Erik\n\nand I first met, many months ago, he said that the relationship between IT\n\nand the business is like a dysfunctional marriage—both feel powerless and\n\nheld hostage by the other. I’ve thought about this for months, and I finally\n\nfigured something out.\n\n“A dysfunctional marriage assumes that the business and IT are two\n\nseparate entities. IT should either be embedded into business operations or\n\ninto the business. Voilà! There you go. No tension. No marriage, and maybe\n\nno IT Department, either.”\n\nI just stare at Steve. In some Erik-like way, something about what he\n\nsays seems inescapably true.\n\nIn that moment, I decide. I’ll still have to talk with Paige, but I know\n\nwith certainty that the journey Steve wants to send me on is important—\n\nboth for me and my family and for my entire profession.\n\n“I’ll think about it,” I say, solemnly.\n\nSteve smiles broadly and stands up. When I grasp his outstretched hand,\n\nhe clasps my shoulder firmly. “Good. This is going to be fun.”\n\nJust then, the doorbell rings, and within a few minutes, the whole gang\n\nis here—Wes, Patty, John, and Chris—so are Maggie, Brent, Ann, and, holy\n\ncrap, even Dick and Ron.\n\nAs the party starts to get louder and louder, each of them congratulate\n\nme, drinks in hand. It’s obvious that they knew everything already,\n\nincluding Steve’s startling offer to go on a three-year training plan to\n\nbecome the next COO.\n\nDick approaches me, holding a glass of scotch. “Congratulations, Bill.\n\nI’m looking forward to working closely with you in the years to come.”\n\nShortly, I find myself laughing with a bunch of other people, accepting\n\ntheir congratulations, and trading stories about the amazing journey we’ve\n\nbeen on.\n\nWes claps me on the shoulder. “Now that you’re being promoted,” he\n\nsays, even more loudly and brashly than normal, “We all thought we should\n\ngive you something that celebrates what we’ve accomplished. Something\n\nthat you can take with you that will remind you not to forget about us, you\n\nknow, little people.”\n\nAs he reaches into the box at his feet, he says, “We argued for a long\n\ntime about what it should be. But in the end, it was obvious…”\n\nWhen I see what he pulls out from the box, I burst out laughing.\n\n“Your old craptop!” he exclaims, holding it high in the air. “It was a\n\nshame to make it unusable by bronzing it, but you’ve got to admit, it’s\n\nbeautiful, isn’t it?”\n\nIn disbelief, I gape at it as everyone laughs, clapping and cheering. It\n\nreally is my old laptop. Taking it from Wes, I see the broken hinge and the\n\nduct tape I put on to hold the battery in. And now the entire laptop is\n\ncovered in what looks like a thick layer of gold-colored paint, and it’s\n\nmounted on a Mahogany pedestal.\n\nAt the bottom of the pedestal is a bronze label. I read aloud, “In fond\n\nmemory of dearly departed Bill Palmer, VP of IT Operations,” with the last\n\nyear in parentheses.\n\n“Holy crap, guys,” I say, genuinely touched at their gesture. “You make\n\nit sound like I died!”\n\nEveryone laughs, including Steve. The evening goes by quickly, and I\n\nfind myself surprised that I’m having such a good time. I’m not usually a\n\nsocial person, but tonight, I feel like I’m in the company of friends and\n\ncolleagues who I respect, trust, and genuinely like.\n\nSometime later, Erik arrives. He walks over to me, pausing to scrutinize\n\nthe bronzed laptop. “You know, even though I give you a fifty-fifty chance\n\nof washing out, I still believe in you,” he says, standing in front of me,\n\ntaking a swig of beer. “Congratulations, kid. You deserve it.”\n\n“Thanks,” I say, smiling broadly, genuinely touched at his faint praise.\n\n“Yeah, well, don’t let me down,” he says gruffly. “I’ve never liked this\n\ntown, and you’ll be making me fly into that godforsaken airport for years to\n\ncome. If you screw this up, it will all be for nothing.”\n\n“I’ll do my best,” I say with a surprising amount of confidence. “Wait a\n\nsecond. I thought you’d be coming into town anyway for our board\n\nmeetings?”\n\n“After what I’ve seen, I don’t want any part of it!” Erik says, laughing\n\nloudly. “I think Parts Unlimited is going to make a lot of money. We’ll see\n\nhow good your competition really is, but my suspicion is that they’ll have\n\nno idea what hit them. For me, this isn’t just idle theory. If all goes\n\naccording to plan, within a couple of weeks, I’ll likely be one of the largest\n\ninvestors in this company. The last thing I want is a bunch of insider\n\ninformation that restricts my ability to buy and sell!”\n\nI stare at Erik. He has enough money to become one of our largest\n\ninvestors but still dresses like a manufacturing line worker? I never would\n\nhave guessed that he cared so much about money.\n\nEventually I ask dumbly, “What do you mean by ‘insider information?’”\n\n“I’ve long believed that to effectively manage IT is not only a critical\n\ncompetency but a significant predictor of company performance,” he\n\nexplains. “One of these days, I’d like to create a hedge fund that invests in\n\ncompanies, taking long positions on companies with great IT organizations\n\nthat help the business win, and short the companies where IT lets everyone\n\ndown. I think we’d make a killing. What better way is there to force the\n\nnext generation of CEOs to give a shit about IT?”\n\nHe continues. “I can’t do that if I’m tied up as a board director in all\n\nthese companies. Bad optics. Too much potential jeopardy with the SEC,\n\nauditors, and all that.”\n\n“Ah,” I say.\n\n“Hey, sorry to interrupt,” John interjects, “but I wanted to congratulate\n\nyou and pay my respects.” He then reaches out to shake Erik’s hand, saying,\n\n“And to you, as well, sir.”\n\nErik ignores his hand, staring at him up and down for a couple of\n\nmoments. Then he laughs and shakes his extended hand. “You’ve come a\n\nlong way, John. Well done. And by the way, I like the new look. Very Euro\n\ndiscotheque.”\n\n“Thanks, Erkel,” he says, deadpan. “I couldn’t have done it without you.\n\nI’m grateful.”\n\n“My pleasure,” Erik says jovially. “Just don’t hang out with auditors too\n\nmuch. It’s not good for anyone.”\n\nJohn shakes his head agreeably, returning to the party. Erik turns to me\n\nand says conspiratorially, “Now that is a rather remarkable transformation,\n\nwouldn’t you agree?”\n\nI turn around to look at John. He’s laughing and trading insults with\n\nWes.\n\n“So,” Erik says, interrupting my train of thought. “What are your plans\n\nfor the rest of the IT organization? Given this promotion, you’ve got some\n\npositions to fill.”\n\nI turn back to Erik. “You know, I could never have predicted this.” Erik\n\nsnorts dismissively, which I ignore. “Wes, Patty, and I have talked about\n\nthis a lot. I’m sure I’m going to promote Patty to be VP of IT Operations.\n\nShe’s the closest we have to a plant manager for IT Operations, and she’ll\n\nkick ass,” I say with a smile.\n\n“Good choice,” he responds. “She certainly doesn’t look like your\n\ntypical IT Operations manager, though… And Wes?”\n\n“Believe it or not, Wes made it very clear he doesn’t want to be VP of IT\n\nOperations,” I respond. With less certainty, I say, “If I’m supposed to vacate\n\nmy role as CIO in two years, I think Wes will have a big decision to make. If\n\nI could wave a magic wand, he’d take over for Patty as head of IT\n\nOperations, and Patty will be become the next CIO. But how am I ever going\n\nto get everyone ready if Steve keeps heaping more responsibilities on me?”\n\nErik rolls his eyes. “Give me a break. You’re bored in your current role.\n\nYou’re going to become a lot less bored. Fast. And remember that there are\n\na lot of experienced people around you who’ve been on similar journeys, so\n\ndon’t be the idiot that fails because he didn’t ask for help.”\n\nHe turns to leave but then looks at me with a glint in his eye. “Speaking\n\nof helping other people, I think you owe me something.”\n\n“Of course,” I respond sincerely, suddenly wondering if I’ve been set up\n\nfrom the very beginning. “Whatever you want, just say the word.”\n\n“I need you to help me elevate the state of the practice of how\n\norganizations manage technology. Let’s face it. Life in IT is pretty shitty\n\nwhen it’s so misunderstood and mismanaged. It becomes thankless and\n\nfrustrating as people realize that they are powerless to change the outcome,\n\nlike an endlessly repeating horror movie. If that’s not damaging to our self-\n\nworth as human beings, I don’t know what is. That’s got to change,” he says\n\npassionately. “I want to improve the lives of one million IT workers in the\n\nnext five years. As someone wise once told me, ‘Messiahs are good, but\n\nscripture is better.’”\n\nHe says, “I want you to write a book, describing the Three Ways and\n\nhow other people can replicate the transformation you’ve made here at Parts\n\nUnlimited. Call it The DevOps Cookbook and show how IT can regain the\n\ntrust of the business and end decades of intertribal warfare. Can you do that\n\nfor me?”\n\nWrite a book? He can’t be serious.\n\nI reply, “I’m not a writer. I’ve never written a book before. In fact, I\n\nhaven’t written anything longer than an e-mail in a decade.”\n\nUnamused, he says sternly, “Learn.”\n\nShaking my head for a moment, I finally say, “Of course. It would be an\n\nhonor and a privilege to write The DevOps Cookbook for you while I\n\nembark on what will probably be the most challenging three years of my\n\nentire career.”\n\n“Very good. It’ll be a great book,” he says, smiling. Then he claps me\n\nagain on the shoulder. “Go enjoy the evening. You deserve it.”\n\nEverywhere I look, I see people who are genuinely having fun and\n\nenjoying each other’s company. With my drink in hand, I ponder how far\n\nwe’ve come. During the Phoenix launch, I doubt anyone in this group could\n\nhave imagined being part of a super-tribe that was bigger than just Dev or\n\nOps or Security. There’s a term that we’re hearing more lately: something\n\ncalled “DevOps.” Maybe everyone attending this party is a form of\n\nDevOps, but I suspect it’s something much more than that. It’s Product\n\nManagement, Development, IT Operations, and even Information Security\n\nall working together and supporting one another. Even Steve is a part of this\n\nsuper-tribe.\n\nIn that moment, I let myself feel how incredibly proud I am of everyone\n\nin this room. What we’ve pulled off is remarkable, and even though my\n\nfuture is probably less certain than anytime in my career, I feel incredible\n\nexcitement at the challenges the coming years are going to bring.\n\nAs I take another sip of beer, something catches my eye. A bunch of my\n\npeople start to look at their phones. Moments later, on the other side of the\n\nroom, one of the developers next to Brent is peering into his phone, too,\n\nwith everyone huddled around him.\n\nOld instincts kicking in, I urgently look around the room for Patty who\n\nis making a beeline toward me, her phone already in her hand.\n\n“First off, congratulations, boss,” she says, with a half smile on her face.\n\n“You want the bad news or the good news first?”\n\nTurning to her, I say with a sense of calm and inner peace, “What have\n\nwe got, Patty?”\n\nTo access more free resources on IT, DevOps, and helping your business win, visit:\n\nhttp://itrevolution.com/next\n\nJoin us in spreading the word by leaving a review on Amazon or GoodReads, writing a blog post or telling a friend!\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to acknowledge all the support from my loving\n\nwife, who put up with far more than I promised, Margueritte, and my sons,\n\nReid, Parker, and Grant.\n\nI want to thank Todd Sattersten, Tim Grahl, Merridawn Duckler, and\n\nKate Sage for their incredible help and support throughout the development\n\nprocess of this book.

Board\n\nDirector Bob Strauss, who served as company chairman and CEO two\n\ndecades ago, is returning from retirement to assume the role of chairman.\n\nParts Unlimited stock has tumbled 19 percent in the last 30 days under\n\nheavy trading, down 52 percent from its peak three years ago. The company\n\ncontinues to be outmaneuvered by its arch rival, famous for its ability to\n\nanticipate and instantly react to customer needs. Parts Unlimited now trails\n\nthe competition in sales growth, inventory turns and profitability.\n\nThe company has long promised that its “Phoenix” program will restore\n\nprofitability and close the gap by tightly integrating its retailing and e-\n\ncommerce channels. Already years late, many expect the company to\n\nannounce another program delay in its analyst earnings call next month.\n\nWe believe that institutional investors such as Wayne-Yokohama\n\npressured Bob to reconfigure the board as the first of many actions to right\n\nthe ship in Elkhart Grove. A growing number of investors are pushing for\n\nmore significant leadership changes and strategic options, such as splitting\n\nup the company.\n\nDespite Masters’ past achievements that transformed Parts Unlimited\n\ninto one of the top automotive parts manufacturers and retailers, we believe\n\nsplitting up the chairman and CEO roles is long overdue.

I spent the morning at the doctor’s office with my three-\n\nyear-old son, trying to keep the other toddlers from coughing on us,\n\nconstantly being interrupted by my vibrating phone.\n\nThe problem of the day is intermittent network outages. As the Director\n\nof Midrange Technology Operations, I’m responsible for the availability\n\nand smooth functioning of a relatively small IT group at Parts Unlimited, a\n\n$4 billion per year manufacturing and retail company based in Elkhart\n\nGrove.\n\nEven in the technology backwaters I’ve chosen to make my turf, I need\n\nto track network issues closely. Because these issues disrupt the services my\n\ngroup provides, people will blame the outages on me.\n\n“Hi, Bill. This is Laura Beck, from Human Resources.” She’s not the\n\nperson I usually deal with from HR, but her name and voice sound\n\nfamiliar…\n\nHoly crap. I try not to swear out loud when I remember who she is.\n\nFrom the monthly company meetings. She’s the VP in charge of HR.\n\n“Good morning, Laura,” I say with forced cheer. “What can I do for\n\nyou?”\n\nShe responds, “When will you be in the office? I’d like to meet as soon\n\nas possible.”",

Was there an\n\noutage I didn’t respond to quickly enough? As an IT Operations guy, the\n\ncareer-ending outage is the joke my peers and I tell one another daily.\n\nWe agree to meet at her desk in a half hour, but when she doesn’t share\n\nany more details, I say in my most cajoling voice, “Laura, what’s this all\n\nabout? Is there a problem in my group? Or am I the one in trouble?” I laugh\n\nextra loudly, so she hears it over the phone.\n\n“No, it’s nothing like that,” she says breezily. “You could even say this\n\nis good news. Thanks, Bill.”\n\nWhen she hangs up, I try to think of what good news would even look\n\nlike these days. When I can’t, I turn the radio back on and immediately hear\n\na commercial from our largest retailing competitor. They’re talking about\n\ntheir unparalleled customer service and a breathtaking new offering that\n\nallows people to customize their cars with their friends online.\n\nThe ad is brilliant. I’d use the service in a second, if I weren’t such a\n\nloyal company man. How do they keep bringing such incredible new\n\ncapabilities to market while we remain stuck in the mud?\n\nI turn the radio off. Despite all our hard work and late nights, the\n\ncompetition keeps leapfrogging us. When our Marketing people hear this\n\nad, they’ll go ballistic. Because they’re likely art or music majors, not\n\npeople with a technology background, they’ll publicly promise the\n\nimpossible and IT will have to figure out how to deliver.\n\nEach year, it gets harder. We have to do more with less, to\n\nsimultaneously maintain competitiveness and reduce costs.",

You learn that you argue your case as best as you\n\ncan with your officer, but sometimes you have to say, “Yes, sir,” and then\n\ngo take that hill.\n\nI pull into the parking lot. Three years ago, finding an empty parking\n\nspot was impossible. Now, after all the layoffs, parking is rarely a problem.\n\nWhen I walk into Building 5 where Laura and her staff reside, I\n\nimmediately notice how nicely furnished it is. I can smell the new carpeting\n\nand there’s even classy wood paneling on the walls. Suddenly, the paint and\n\ncarpet in my building seem decades overdue for replacement.\n\nThat’s IT’s lot in life. At least we’re not in a dingy, dimly lit dank\n\nbasement, like in the British TV show, The IT Crowd.\n\nWhen I get to Laura’s office, she looks up and smiles. “Good seeing you\n\nagain, Bill.” She extends her hand, which I shake. “Have a seat while I see\n\nwhether Steve Masters is available to meet.”\n\nSteve Masters? Our CEO?\n\nShe picks up and dials her phone while I sit down, looking around. The\n\nlast time I was here was a couple of years ago when HR notified us that we\n\nneeded to dedicate a room for nursing mothers. We were critically short of\n\noffice and meeting space, and we had big project deadlines looming.\n\nWe merely wanted to use a conference room in a different building.\n\nHowever, Wes made it sound like we were a bunch of 1950s Mad Men\n\nNeanderthals. Shortly afterward, we were both summoned here for a half\n\nday of political rehabilitation and sensitivity training.

I force myself to banter about our\n\nfamilies and kids, trying not to think about my other pressing commitments.\n\nEventually I say, without much grace, “So, what can I do for you this\n\nmorning?”\n\n“Of course.” She pauses, and then says, “Effective as of this morning,\n\nLuke and Damon are no longer with the company. This went all the way to\n\nthe top, with Steve getting involved.

Wes is telling us that the pig will probably\n\nbreak its leg, and it’ll be my guys who work all-nighters and weekends to\n\nkeep that pig alive.”\n\nChris replies hotly, “Don’t give me that bullshit about ‘throwing the pig\n\nover the wall.’ We invited your people to our architecture and planning\n\nmeetings, but I can count on one hand the number of times you guys\n\nactually showed up. We routinely have had to wait days or even weeks to\n\nget anything we need from you guys!”\n\nThen he just holds up his hands, as if everything is outside of his\n\ncontrol. “Look, I’d like more time, too.

What we require from you now is the\n\n‘management response letter.’ You need to investigate each of these\n\nfindings, confirm them, and then create a remediation plan. We’ll review it\n\nand then present to the audit committee and the board of directors.\n\n“Normally, you would have months to prepare your response letter and\n\nexecute your remediation plan,” she continues, suddenly looking\n\napologetic. “Unfortunately, the way the audit testing calendar worked out,\n\nwe only have three weeks until the external auditors arrive. That’s\n\nregrettable. We’ll make sure to give IT more time in the next audit cycle.\n\nBut this time around, we require your response by…”\n\nShe looks at her calendar. “One week from Monday, at the very latest.\n\nDo you think you can make it?”",

The first issue is the potential\n\nmaterial weakness, which is outlined on page seven. This finding states that\n\nan unauthorized or untested change to an application supporting financial\n\nreporting could have been put into production. This could potentially result\n\nin an undetected material error, due to fraud or otherwise.

The one consistent theme in the\n\ninterviews was that everyone struggles to get their project work done. Even\n\nwhen they do have time, they struggle to prioritize all their commitments.\n\nPeople in the business constantly ask our staff to do things for them.\n\nEspecially Marketing.”\n\n“Sarah?” I ask.\n\n“Sure, but it’s not only her,” she replies. “Practically every executive in\n\nthe company is guilty of going directly to their favorite IT person, either\n\nasking a favor or pressuring them to get something done.”\n\n“How do we change the game here and get resourced to do all these\n\nprojects properly?” I ask. “What should we be asking Steve for?”\n\nWes scrolls down his spreadsheet. “Based on our rough numbers, we’ll\n\nprobably need to hire seven people: three database administrators, two\n\nserver engineers, one network engineer, and one virtualization engineer. Of\n\ncourse, you know that it’ll take time to find these people and then another\n\nsix to twelve months before they’re fully productive.”\n\nOf course, I knew that new hires aren’t productive right away. But it was\n\nstill dispiriting to hear Wes point out that real help was still a long way off,\n\neven if Steve approved the headcount.\n\nLater that day, as I’m walking to our second CAB meeting, I feel hopeful. If\n\nwe can get our old change process going, we might be able to quickly\n\nresolve one of the largest audit issues and get some operational wins, as\n\nwell.",

Why is this suddenly my fault?”\n\nI knew it was too good to be true.\n\nI then hear John say, “That was the right call.

Given the urgency of Phoenix, you can bet your\n\nass that I wouldn’t waste your time if I didn’t think this was important.”\n\nI continue, “First, the events that led to the SAN and payroll failure on\n\nTuesday must not happen again. What started off as a medium-sized payroll\n\nfailure snowballed into a massive friendly-fire SAN incident. Why? Because\n\nwe are not talking to one another about what changes we’re planning or\n\nimplementing. This is not acceptable.”\n\n“Second, John is right. We spent yesterday morning with our auditors,\n\ndiscussing a bunch of deficiencies they found,” I continue. “Dick Landry is\n\nalready crapping bricks because it could impact our quarterly financial\n\nstatements. We need to tighten up our change controls, and as managers and\n\ntechnical leads, we must figure out how we can create a sustainable process\n\nthat will prevent friendly-fire incidents and get the auditors off our back,\n\nwhile still being able to get work done. We are not leaving this room until\n\nwe’ve created a plan to get there. Understood?”\n\nWhen I’m satisfied that everyone has been properly cowed, I open it up\n\nfor discussion. “So what’s preventing us from getting there?”\n\nOne of the technical leads quickly says, “I’ll start. That change\n\nmanagement tool is impossible to use. There’s a million mandatory fields\n\nand most of the time, the drop down boxes for the ‘applications affected’\n\ndon’t even have what I need. It’s why I’ve stopped even putting in change\n\nrequests.”\n\nAnother lead hollers out, “He’s not kidding.

And I’d love to keep the application list up-to-\n\ndate, but I don’t have the resources. Who’s going to keep the application\n\ncatalog and change management database current? You think it just\n\nmagically updates itself?”\n\n“It’s not just the tool, Patty. It’s the entire damned process,” Wes asserts.\n\n“When my guys put in change requests, they have to wait a lifetime to get\n\napprovals, let alone get on the schedule. We have the business breathing\n\ndown our neck to get crap done. We can’t wait for you to hem and haw,\n\ncomplaining that we didn’t fill out the form right.”\n\nPatty snaps, “That’s crap, and you know it. Your people routinely break\n\nthe rules. Like, say, when everyone marks all their change requests as an\n\n‘urgent’ or ‘emergency change’. That field is only for actual emergencies!”\n\nWes retorts, “We have to do that, because marking them urgent is the\n\nonly way to get your team to look at it! Who can wait three weeks for an\n\napproval?”\n\nOne of the lead engineers suggests, “Maybe we make another field\n\ncalled ‘extremely urgent?’”\n\nI wait until the uproar quiets down. At this rate, we’re getting nowhere\n\nfast. Thinking furiously, I finally say, “Let’s take a ten-minute break.”\n\nWhen we reconvene the meeting, I say, “We are not leaving this meeting\n\nwithout a list of authorized and scheduled changes that we’re implementing\n\nin the next thirty days.",

I can see both sides of the argument.\n\nAfter thirty minutes of arguing, it’s still not clear that we know the\n\ndefinition of what a “change” should be.\n\nWas rebooting a server a change? Yes, because we don’t want anyone\n\nrebooting servers willy-nilly, especially if it’s running a critical service.\n\nHow about turning off a server? Yes, for the same reason.\n\nHow about turning on a server? No, we all thought.

And for that matter, Dick, as\n\nwell.”\n\nI follow him to his blue subcompact rental car and we drive five minutes\n\nto MRP-8, one of our manufacturing plants. It’s enormous, probably four\n\ntimes bigger than my building, but this one is in immaculate condition, with\n\nsome obvious recent renovations and add-ons.\n\nA security guard in her late fifties greets us, “Good afternoon, Dr. Reid.\n\nHow nice to see you! How are you doing? It’s been a long time.”\n\nErik shakes her hand warmly, replying with a wink, “Great seeing you\n\nagain, Dorothy. We’re just here to get a birds-eye view of the plant floor.\n\nCan we still get on the catwalk?”\n\nShe replies with a flirtatious smile, “It’s closed to most people, but for\n\nyou, I think we can make an exception.”\n\nI look at Erik suspiciously. He supposedly couldn’t get anyone’s name\n\nright, and yet he apparently remembers the name of some security guard\n\nfrom years past. And no one ever mentioned anything about a Dr. Reid.\n\nAfter climbing five flights of stairs, we’re standing on a catwalk that\n\noverlooks the entire plant floor, looking like it goes on for at least two city\n\nblocks in every direction.\n\n“Look down there,” he says. “You can see loading docks on each side of\n\nthe building. Raw materials are brought in on this side, and the finished\n\ngoods leave out the other. Orders come off that printer down there. If you\n\nstand here long enough, you can actually see all the WIP, that’s ‘work in\n\nprocess’ or ‘inventory’ for plant newbies, make its way toward the other\n\nside of the plant floor, where it’s shipped to customers as finished goods.”",

In many places, it was piled as high as you could stack them\n\nusing those big forklifts over there. On some days, you couldn’t even see\n\nthe other side of the building. In hindsight, we now know that WIP is one of\n\nthe root causes for chronic due-date problems, quality issues, and expediters\n\nhaving to rejuggle priorities every day. It’s amazing that this business didn’t\n\ngo under as a result.”\n\nHe gestures broadly with both arms outstretched, “In the 1980s, this\n\nplant was the beneficiary of three incredible scientifically-grounded\n\nmanagement movements. You’ve probably heard of them: the Theory of\n\nConstraints, Lean production or the Toyota Production System, and Total\n\nQuality Management. Although each movement started in different places,\n\nthey all agree on one thing: WIP is the silent killer. Therefore, one of the\n\nmost critical mechanisms in the management of any plant is job and\n\nmaterials release. Without it, you can’t control WIP.”\n\nHe points at a desk near the loading docks closest to us. “See that desk\n\nover there?”\n\nI nod but also look pointedly at my watch: 4:45 p.m.\n\nOblivious to my impatience, he says, “Let me tell you a story. Decades\n\nago, there used to be a guy named Mark. He was the supervisor for that first\n\nwork center, right down there by that desk. Those racks hold the folders for\n\nincoming jobs. Isn’t it amazing that those folders look exactly like they did\n\nback then?\n\n“At any rate,” he continues, “one day I see Mark picking up a folder to\n\nstart some job.

This is the way I’ve done it for twenty years.’”\n\nHe laughs. “I suppose to him, it sounds like a reasonable way to pick\n\nwhich job to perform. He’s keeping the first station busy, and it’s similar to\n\nfirst-in, first-out scheduling. But of course, now everyone knows that you\n\ndon’t release work based on the availability of the first station. Instead, it\n\nshould be based on the tempo of how quickly the bottleneck resource can\n\nconsume the work.”\n\nI just stare at him blankly.\n\nHe continues, “Because of how Mark was releasing work, inventory\n\nkept piling up in front of our bottleneck, and jobs were never finished on\n\ntime. Every day was an emergency. For years, we were awarded Best\n\nCustomer of the Year from our air freight shipment company, because we\n\nwere overnighting thousands of pounds of finished goods to angry\n\ncustomers almost every week.”\n\nHe pauses and then says emphatically, “Eliyahu M. Goldratt, who\n\ncreated the Theory of Constraints, showed us how any improvements made\n\nanywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion. Astonishing, but true! Any\n\nimprovement made after the bottleneck is useless, because it will always\n\nremain starved, waiting for work from the bottleneck. And any\n\nimprovements made before the bottleneck merely results in more inventory\n\npiling up at the bottleneck.”",

But I learned most of this already in business school. I don’t\n\nsee how this could possibly be relevant to managing IT Operations.

But sometimes the business rules\n\nchange, and we also have to keep it patched. It’s running an operating\n\nsystem that’s out of maintenance, so it’s always dicey…”\n\n“Good! It’s a risky change.

Patty, changes like this should\n\nbe at the top of the pile during our meetings.”\n\nPatty nods, taking notes saying, “Got it. We’re predefining high-risk\n\ncategories of change that not only must have change requests submitted, but\n\nmust have authorization before being scheduled and implemented.”\n\nWe quickly create a list of the top ten most fragile services, applications,\n\nand infrastructure. Any change request that could affect any of these will be\n\nimmediately flagged for CAB scrutiny.\n\nPatty adds, “We need to create some standard procedures around these\n\nchanges—like when we’ll want them implemented—and have key\n\nresources not only aware of them but also standing by, just in case things go\n\nwrong—even the vendors.”\n\nShe adds with a half smile, “You know, like having firefighters and\n\nambulances lined up on the runway, ready to spray safety foam when the\n\nairplane lands in flames.”\n\nWes laughs and adds wryly, “Yeah, in the case of PUCCAR, have the\n\ncoroner stock up on a bunch of body bags, too.

That’s admirable, but I just came from Kirsten’s daily\n\nPhoenix stand-up. There are five tasks that have been assigned to you,\n\nwhich are now late.”\n\nI show him the five tasks from the project management meeting.

I’d do this from home if I\n\ncould, but the network connection is too slow.”\n\n“Who’s been calling you, and what do they want?” I ask, frowning.\n\n“Usually it’s other IT people who are having problems fixing\n\nsomething,” he replies, rolling his eyes. “When something goes down, I’m\n\napparently the only person who knows where to go looking.”\n\n“I thought Wes hired a bunch of people to take over some of these\n\nescalations from you.” I say.",

No, because opening up a\n\nticket for each of those calls would take longer than fixing the problem.”\n\nBrent says dismissively. “The number of calls depends on the day.

It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical\n\ndebt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to\n\nincrease over time,” he says.\n\nHe continues, “You’ve identified this Brent person as a constraint to\n\nrestore service. Trust me, you’ll find that he constrains many other\n\nimportant flows of work, as well.”\n\nI try to interrupt to ask a question, but he continues headlong, “There are\n\nfive focusing steps which Goldratt describes in The Goal: Step 1 is to\n\nidentify the constraint.

Remember,\n\nany improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes?\n\n“Step 2 is to exploit the constraint,” he continues. “In other words, make\n\nsure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. It should\n\nnever be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always\n\nbe working on the highest priority commitment the IT Operations\n\norganization has made to the rest of the enterprise.

And spending night\n\nafter night, praying that they would be okay, and not wanting one twin to\n\nlive his life without the other when they were destined to be able to\n\nunderstand each other in a way that no other person in the world could.\n\nAnd how this experience taught him how selfish he was and his\n\nnewfound desire to be unselfish.\n\nTo my surprise, I blink back tears, seeing Chris’ earnest aspirations for\n\nhis kids’ future. I furtively notice others doing the same.\n\n“Thank you for sharing, Chris,” says Steve solemnly after a moment and\n\nthen looks around the room. “Who’s next?”\n\nTo my surprise and relief, Wes goes next.\n\nI learn that he’s been engaged three times in his life, and at the last\n\nminute, called off each one. And when he finally does get married, he\n\nquickly got divorced because she was tired of his maniacal car racing habit.\n\nHow can a guy who weighs nearly 250 pounds race cars?",

What would happen if you\n\nstopped releasing jobs and materials onto the plant floor?”\n\nSurprised to be the target of the question, Steve considers it for a\n\nmoment. “The amount of WIP in the plant goes down, because work will\n\nstart leaving the plant as finished goods.”\n\n“Correct,” Erik says, nodding approvingly. “And what will likely\n\nhappen to due-date performance?”\n\n“Due-date performance goes up, because WIP went down.” Steve says,\n\nlooking increasingly suspicious and reluctant about where Erik might be\n\nleading him.\n\n“Yes, very good,” Erik says encouragingly. “But on the other hand, what\n\nhappens to inventory levels if you allow the plant to continue to accept\n\norders and release new jobs?”\n\nHe says after a moment, “WIP goes up.”\n\n“Excellent,” Erik says. “And what happens to due-date performance?”\n\nSteve looks like he’s just swallowed something that isn’t agreeing with\n\nhim, and he says eventually, “Everyone knows that in manufacturing, as WIP\n\nincreases, due-date performance goes down.\n\n“Wait a goddamned minute, here,” he says, squinting at Erik. “You’re\n\nnot actually suggesting that this applies to IT, too?

That’s 130 people in IT Operations just sitting around.\n\nDoesn’t that sound a bit…wasteful?”\n\nErik scoffs and says, “I’ll tell you about wasteful.

We’re probably only a couple weeks\n\naway from having those cards stacked to the ceiling, too.”\n\nI nod. He’s right.\n\nThe idea is for IT Operations and Development to not accept any new\n\nprojects for two weeks and to stop all work in IT Operations except for work\n\nrelated to Phoenix.\n\nI look around. “If we single-task on the most important project for two\n\nweeks and still aren’t able to make a big dent, then I think we should all\n\nfind new day jobs.”\n\nChris nods. “I think we should give it a shot. We’ll keep working on the\n\nother active projects, but we’ll freeze all deployment work except Phoenix.\n\nFrom Bill’s perspective, it will look like that’s the only thing we’re working\n\non.

Do you think it’s unsafe to release the monitoring project?”\n\nPatty wrinkles her forehead. “We know that IT work can be projects or\n\nchanges. And in many of the projects, there are many tasks or subprojects\n\nthat show up over and over again. Like setting up a server. It’s recurring\n\nwork. I guess you could call that a subassembly.”\n\nShe stands up, walks to the whiteboard, and draws some boxes. “Let’s\n\nuse the example of configuring a server. It involves procurement, installing\n\nthe OS and applications on it according to some specification, and then\n\ngetting it racked and stacked. Then we validate that it’s been built correctly.\n\nEach of these steps are typically done by different people. Maybe each step\n\nis like a work center, each with its own machines, methods, men, and\n\nmeasures.”\n\nWith less certainty, she continues, “But I’m not sure if I know what the\n\nmachine would be.”\n\nI smile as Patty scrawls on the board.

At last, she says, “I suspect that until we do\n\na couple of these, we’ll just be stumbling in the dark.

It makes demand and WIP visible, and is used to signal upstream\n\nand downstream stations.\n\n“I’m experimenting with putting kanbans around our key resources. Any\n\nactivities they work on must go through the kanban.

Wes complained\n\nabout tickets related to Phoenix bouncing around for weeks, which delayed\n\nthe deployment.\n\nIt was happening then, too. That wasn’t a handoff between IT Operations\n\npeople. That was a handoff between the Development and IT Operations\n\norganization, which is far more complex.\n\nCreating and prioritizing work inside a department is hard. Managing\n\nwork among departments must be at least ten times more difficult.\n\nPatty says, “What that graph says is that everyone needs idle time, or\n\nslack time. If no one has slack time, WIP gets stuck in the system. Or more\n\nspecifically, stuck in queues, just waiting.”",

You’ve just found a big pile of\n\nrecurring work! If we can document and standardize this recurring work,\n\nand gain some mastery over it, just like you did with laptop replacement,\n\nI’m sure we can improve flow!”\n\nI add, “You know, if we can standardize all our recurring deployment\n\nwork, we’ll finally be able to enforce uniformity of our production\n\nconfigurations.

We can’t let that happen again.”\n\n“Good point,” Wes grunts. “You know, it’s odd. So many of these\n\nproblems we’ve been facing are caused by decisions we made. We have met\n\nthe enemy. And he is us.”\n\nPatty says, “You know, deployments are like final assembly in a\n\nmanufacturing plant. Every flow of work goes through it, and you can’t ship",

They want someone\n\nto listen to them and help make sure Steve gets the message.”\n\nI find myself leaning forward. I’m surprised to hear Dick giving John,\n\nand therefore me, such candid and informative answers.\n\n“What differentiates a good day from a bad day for you?” John\n\ncontinues.\n\nMomentarily taken aback, Dick laughs loudly. “I’ll tell you what a good\n\nday feels like. It feels like the end of the year when we’re beating the pants\n\noff the competition—when we haven’t closed the books yet, but everyone\n\nknows that it’s going to be a monster quarter. All the sales people would\n\nhave hit quota, and the ones on top would have hit their accelerators. A\n\ngood day feels like my staff panicking about the size of the commission\n\nchecks we’re going to be writing them.",

Incident recovery time\n\nis down, too, probably by more than half.\n\nThe insight we’ve gained from that first strange meeting with Dick and\n\nJohn tells me that we’re hot on the trail of understanding how we can really\n\nhelp the business win.\n\nOpening up my e-mail, I see a note from Kirsten. All her project\n\nmanagers are gushing about how projects are flowing so much faster. The\n\nnumber of tasks waiting for Brent and the rest of IT Operations is way\n\ndown. In fact, if I’m reading the report correctly, Brent is almost caught up.\n\nOn the project front, we’re in fantastic shape—especially with Phoenix.\n\nThere’s another Phoenix deployment scheduled for Friday.

As\n\npart of the due diligence process, we were going to hear from all the\n\nprospective outsourcers all the dogmas we used to believe before all our\n\ninteractions with Erik. It will be interesting to see if we can retrain them.\n\nIt seems to me that if anyone is managing IT without talking about the\n\nThree Ways, they are managing IT on dangerously faulty assumptions.\n\nAs I’m pondering this, my phone rings. It’s John.\n\nWhen I answer, he says, “My team discovered something troubling\n\ntoday. To prevent unauthorized black market IT activities from cropping up,\n\nwe’ve started routinely reviewing all the proposed projects coming into\n\nKirsten’s Project Management Office. We also search all the corporate\n\ncredit cards for recurring charges that might be for online or cloud\n\nservices—which is just another form of unauthorized IT. Some people are\n\ngoing around the project freeze. You have time to talk?”\n\n“Let’s meet in ten minutes,” I say. “Don’t leave me hanging. Who’s\n\ntrying to backdoor the system?”\n\nI hear John laugh on the other end of the line. “Sarah. Who else?”\n\nI invite Wes and Patty to the impromptu meeting but only Patty can make it.\n\nJohn starts presenting what he found. Sarah’s group has four instances\n\nof using outside vendors and online services. Two are relatively innocuous\n\nbut the others are more serious: she has contracted a vendor for a $200,000\n\nproject to do customer data mining and another vendor to plug into all our\n\nPOS systems to get sales data for customer analytics.\n\n“The first problem is that both projects violate the data privacy policy\n\nthat we’ve given our customers,” John says. “We repeatedly promise that",

But make no mistake, if we go ahead with\n\nthe customer data mining initiative, we’re out of compliance with our own\n\nprivacy policy. We may even be breaking several state privacy regulations\n\nthat expose us to some liability.”\n\nThis doesn’t sound good, but John’s tone of voice suggests there’s worse\n\nto come. “The second problem is that Sarah’s vendor uses the same\n\ndatabase technology that we used for our cafeteria POS system, which we\n\nknow is virtually impossible to secure and maintain support for in\n\nproduction, if and when it becomes a part of daily operations.”\n\nI feel my face get red hot. It’s not just about another cafeteria POS system\n\nthat we’ll need to retrofit for production. It’s because applications like this\n\ncontribute to our inaccurate sales order entry and inventory management\n\ndata. We have too many cooks in the kitchen and no one accountable for\n\nmaintaining the integrity of the data.\n\n“Look, I don’t care about Sarah’s project management and invoicing\n\ntools—if it makes them more productive, let them use it,” I say. “It’s\n\nprobably safe as long as it doesn’t interface with an existing business\n\nsystem, store confidential data, affect financial reporting, or whatever. But\n\nif it does, then we need to be involved and at least confirm that it doesn’t\n\nimpact any of our existing commitments.”\n\n“I agree,” John says, “Want me to take the first stab at that outsourced IT\n\nservice policy document?”\n\n“Perfect,” I say. But with less certainty, I continue, “Although, what’s\n\nthe right way to handle Sarah? I feel completely out of my league. Steve\n\nconstantly protects her.

Why?”\n\nPatty snorts. “If Steve were a woman, I’d say that he’s attracted to\n\ndangerous men. A bunch of us have speculated about this for years. I’ve had\n\na theory, which I must say, was pretty much validated in our last off-site.”\n\nWhen she sees John and me both conspiratorially leaning forward, she\n\nsmiles. “Steve prides himself on being an operations guy, and he’s admitted\n\nseveral times in company meetings that he doesn’t have a flair for strategy.

For a decade, Bob was the strategy guy, and all Steve had to\n\ndo was execute the vision.\n\n“For years, Steve searched for a strategy person to be his right-hand\n\nman. He went through quite a few people, even setting a couple executives\n\nagainst each other in this awful, drawn out competition. Pretty\n\nMachiavellian,” she continues. “And Sarah won. The word on the street was\n\nthat there was a lot of backstabbing and underhanded tactics, but I suppose\n\nthat’s what it takes to come out on top. Evidently, she has mastered how to\n\nwhisper the right things in his ear, reinforcing his paranoia and aspirations.”\n\nPatty’s explanation is so much more sophisticated than anything I’ve\n\ncome up with. In fact, it sounds strikingly similar to what Paige would\n\nspeculate when I got that distant, angry look at dinnertime.\n\nJohn says awkwardly, “Umm, you don’t think there’s anything between\n\nthem, do you?

I was actually\n\nhoping that Erik could give us some insights.”\n\nErik looks up, wiping his mustache with a napkin. “Insights? To me, the\n\nanswer to your problem is obvious. The First Way is all about controlling\n\nthe flow of work from Development to IT Operations. You’ve improved\n\nflow by freezing and throttling the project releases, but your batch sizes are\n\nstill way too large. The deployment failure on Friday is proof. You also\n\nhave way too much WIP still trapped inside the plant, and the worst kind,\n\ntoo. Your deployments are causing unplanned recovery work downstream.”",

But if it’s outside the organization, what can we possibly do?\n\nWe can’t convince an outsourcer to change their priorities or their\n\nmanagement practices as we’ve done.\n\nSuddenly, a glimmer of an idea hits me.\n\n“How many people do they have allocated to our account?” I ask.\n\n“I don’t know,” Wes says. “I think there are six people assigned at thirty\n\npercent allocation. It probably depends on their role.”\n\n“Get Patty in here, along with a copy of the contract, and let’s work\n\nthrough the math. And see if you can grab someone from Purchasing, too. I\n\nhave an audacious proposal that I’d like to explore.”\n\n“Who outsourced the MRP application?” Steve asks from behind his desk.",

Obviously, they didn’t view it as a core competency.”\n\n“Well, it’s obviously a core competency now!” replies Steve. “Right\n\nnow, that damned outsourcer is holding us hostage, preventing us from\n\ndoing something that needs to be done. They’re more than just a roadblock.\n\nThey’re now jeopardizing our future.”\n\nI nod. “In short, we’d like to break the outsourcing contract early,\n\nbringing those resources back into the company. We’re talking about\n\napproximately six people, some of whom are still onsite. To buy out the\n\nremainder of the contract two years early would be almost one million\n\ndollars, and we would regain complete control of the MRP application and\n\nunderlying infrastructure. Everyone on this team believes this is the right\n\nthing to do, and we’ve even got the initial blessing from Dick’s team.”\n\nI hold my breath. I just threw out a very a big number. It’s considerably\n\nbigger than the budget increase I asked for two months ago when I got\n\nthrown out of this office.\n\nI quickly continue, “Chris believes that once this MRP application is back\n\nin-house, we could build an interface to Unicorn. We would then start\n\nbuilding the manufacturing capability to move us from ‘build to inventory’\n\nto ‘build to order,’ which would enable us to provide the custom kits as\n\nSarah requested. If we execute everything flawlessly, and the integration\n\nwith the order entry and inventory management systems goes as planned,\n\nwe could match what our competitors are doing in about ninety days.”",

What are the top risks?”\n\nChris takes this one. “The outsourcer may have made big changes to the\n\ncode base that we don’t know about, which would slow down the\n\ndevelopment schedule. But my personal belief is that this risk is minimal.\n\nBased on their behavior, I don’t think they made any significant changes to\n\nfunctionality.\n\n“I’m not worried about the technical challenges,” he continues. “The\n\nMRP was not designed for large batch sizes and certainly not batch sizes of\n\none that we’re talking about here. But I’m sure we can make something\n\nwork short-term and figure out a long-term strategy as we go.”\n\nWhen Chris finishes, Patty adds, “The outsourcer could also decide to\n\nmake the transition back to us difficult, and there could be animosity from\n\nthe affected engineers. There were a lot of hard feelings when we\n\nannounced the contract—among other things, their pay was cut the instant\n\nthey switched from being Parts Unlimited employees to being a vendor.”\n\nShe continues. “We should get John involved right away, because we’ll\n\nneed to take away access from all the outsourcer staff that we’re not\n\nbringing back in.”\n\nWes laughs, saying, “I’d like to personally delete the login credentials of\n\nthat jackass account manager.

Given this promotion, you’ve got some\n\npositions to fill.”\n\nI turn back to Erik. “You know, I could never have predicted this.” Erik\n\nsnorts dismissively, which I ignore. “Wes, Patty, and I have talked about\n\nthis a lot. I’m sure I’m going to promote Patty to be VP of IT Operations.\n\nShe’s the closest we have to a plant manager for IT Operations, and she’ll\n\nkick ass,” I say with a smile.\n\n“Good choice,” he responds. “She certainly doesn’t look like your\n\ntypical IT Operations manager, though… And Wes?”",

With less certainty, I say, “If I’m supposed to vacate\n\nmy role as CIO in two years, I think Wes will have a big decision to make. If\n\nI could wave a magic wand, he’d take over for Patty as head of IT\n\nOperations, and Patty will be become the next CIO. But how am I ever going\n\nto get everyone ready if Steve keeps heaping more responsibilities on me?”\n\nErik rolls his eyes. “Give me a break. You’re bored in your current role.\n\nYou’re going to become a lot less bored. Fast. And remember that there are\n\na lot of experienced people around you who’ve been on similar journeys, so\n\ndon’t be the idiot that fails because he didn’t ask for help.”\n\nHe turns to leave but then looks at me with a glint in his eye. “Speaking\n\nof helping other people, I think you owe me something.”\n\n“Of course,” I respond sincerely, suddenly wondering if I’ve been set up\n\nfrom the very beginning. “Whatever you want, just say the word.”\n\n“I need you to help me elevate the state of the practice of how\n\norganizations manage technology. Let’s face it. Life in IT is pretty shitty\n\nwhen it’s so misunderstood and mismanaged. It becomes thankless and\n\nfrustrating as people realize that they are powerless to change the outcome,\n\nlike an endlessly repeating horror movie. If that’s not damaging to our self-\n\nworth as human beings, I don’t know what is. That’s got to change,” he says\n\npassionately. “I want to improve the lives of one million IT workers in the\n\nnext five years. As someone wise once told me, ‘Messiahs are good, but\n\nscripture is better.’”\n\nHe says, “I want you to write a book, describing the Three Ways and\n\nhow other people can replicate the transformation you’ve made here at Parts\n\nUnlimited.

I’ve never written a book before. In fact, I\n\nhaven’t written anything longer than an e-mail in a decade.”\n\nUnamused, he says sternly, “Learn.”\n\nShaking my head for a moment, I finally say, “Of course. It would be an\n\nhonor and a privilege to write The DevOps Cookbook for you while I\n\nembark on what will probably be the most challenging three years of my\n\nentire career.”\n\n“Very good. It’ll be a great book,” he says, smiling. Then he claps me\n\nagain on the shoulder. “Go enjoy the evening. You deserve it.”\n\nEverywhere I look, I see people who are genuinely having fun and\n\nenjoying each other’s company. With my drink in hand, I ponder how far\n\nwe’ve come. During the Phoenix launch, I doubt anyone in this group could\n\nhave imagined being part of a super-tribe that was bigger than just Dev or\n\nOps or Security. There’s a term that we’re hearing more lately: something\n\ncalled “DevOps.” Maybe everyone attending this party is a form of\n\nDevOps, but I suspect it’s something much more than that. It’s Product\n\nManagement, Development, IT Operations, and even Information Security\n\nall working together and supporting one another. Even Steve is a part of this\n\nsuper-tribe.\n\nIn that moment, I let myself feel how incredibly proud I am of everyone\n\nin this room. What we’ve pulled off is remarkable, and even though my\n\nfuture is probably less certain than anytime in my career, I feel incredible\n\nexcitement at the challenges the coming years are going to bring.",
