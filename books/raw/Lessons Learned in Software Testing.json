many clients |\nYou discover things that will “bug” someone whose opinion matters\nFind important bugs fast .\n\nRun with the programmers\n\nQuestion everything, but not necessarily out loud\n\nYou focus on failure, so your clients can focus on success\n\nYou will not find all the bugs\n\nBeware of testing “completely”\n\nYou don't assure quality by testing\n\nNever be the gatekeeper!\n\nBeware of the not-my-job theory of testing\n\nBeware of becoming a process improvement group\n\nDon’t expect anyone to understand testing, or what you need\n\nto do it well\n\nChapter 2 Thinking Like a Tester\n\nTesting is applied epistemology\n\nStudying epistemology helps you test better\n\nTesting is grounded in cognitive psychology\n\nTesting is in your head\n\nTesting requires inference, not just comparison of output to\nexpected results\n\nGood testers think technically, creatively, critically, and practically\nBlack box testing is not ignorance-based testing\n\nA tester is more than a tourist .\n\nAll tests are an attempt to answer some question\n\nAll testing is based on models\n\nIntuition is a fine beginning, but a lousy conclusion\n\nTo test, you must explore\n\nExploring involves a lot of thinking\n\nUse the logic of abductive inference to discover conjectures.\nUse the logic of conjecture and refutation to evaluate a product\nA requirement is a quality or condition that matters to someone\nwho matters\n\nODDMDAYNAHAHUNAAAHWN =\n\nfo)\n\n11\n\n12\n13\n14\n\n14\n15\n15\n16\n16\n17\n17\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\n20\n\nLesson 32\nLesson 33\nLesson 34\n\nLesson 35\nLesson

requirements by conference, inference, and reference\nUse implicit as well as explicit specifications\n\n“It works” really means it appears to meet some requirement to\nsome degree\n\nIn the end, all you have is an impression of the product\n\nDon't confuse the test with the testing\n\nWhen testing a complex product: plunge in and quit\n\nUse heuristics to quickly generate ideas for tests\n\nYou can’t avoid bias, but you can manage it\n\nYou're harder to fool if you know you're a fool\n\nWhen you miss a bug, check whether the miss is surprising or just\nthe natural outcome of your strategy\nConfusion is a test tool\n\nFresh eyes find failure |\n\nAvoid following procedures unless they followed you first\n\nWhen you do create test procedures, avoid “1287\"\n\nOne important outcome of a test process is a better, smarter tester\nYou can’t master testing unless you reinvent it »\n\nChapter 3 Testing Techniques —\nTesting combines techniques that focus on testers, coverage,\n\npotential problems, activities, and evaluation\n\nPeople-based techniques focus.on who does the testing\nCoverage-based techniques focus on what gets tested\nProblems-based techniques focus on why you're testing (the risks\nyou're testing for) a .\n\nActivity-based techniques focus on how you test\n\nEvaluation-based techniques focus on how to tell whether the test\npassed or failed | |\n\nThe classification of a technique depends on how you think about it.\n\nChapter 4. Bug Advocacy\n\nYou are what you write |\n\nYour advocacy drives the repair of the bugs you report\n\nMake your bug report an effective sales tool .\n\nYour bug report is your representative\n\nTake the time to make your bug reports valuable\n\nAny stakeholder should be able to report a bug\n\nBe careful about rewording other people's bug reports\n\nReport perceived quality gaps as bugs\n\nSome stakeholders cannot report bugs—you’re their proxy\n\nDraw the affected stakeholder’s attention to controversial bugs\nNever use the bug-tracking system to monitor programmers’ performance\nNever use the bug-tracking system to monitor testers’ performance\nReport defects promptly\n\nNever assume that an obvious bug has already been filed\n\nReport design errors\n\n21\n22\n\n23\n23\n23\n24\n25\n25\n26\n\n27\n27\n28\n28\n29\n29\n30\n\n32\n34\n35\n\n39\n40\n\n42\n43\n\n65\n66\n66\n67\n68\n68\n69\n69\n69\n70\n70\n7\\\n7)\n7)\n7\\\n\nLesson 70\nLesson 71\nLesson 72\nLesson 73\nLesson 74\nLesson 75\nLesson 76\nLesson 77\nLesson 78\nLesson 79\nLesson 80\nLesson 81\nLesson 82\nLesson 83\nLesson 84\nLesson 85\nLesson 86\nLesson 87\nLesson 88\nLesson 89\nLesson 90\nLesson 91\nLesson 92\nLesson 93\nLesson 94\nLesson 95\nLesson 96\nLesson 97\nLesson 98\nLesson 99\nLesson 100\nLesson 101\n\nLesson 102\n\nLesson 103\nLesson 104\nLesson 105\nLesson 106\nLesson 107\nLesson 108\nLesson 109\nLesson 110\nLesson 111\nLesson 112\nLesson 113\n\n. ‘ . . :\na ‘ 7 :\nGiese FAL\n\nExtreme-looking bugs are potential security flaws\nUncorner your corner cases\nMinor bugs are worth reporting and fixing\nKeep clear the difference between severity and priority\nA failure is a symptom of an error, not the error itself\nDo follow-up testing on seemingly minor coding errors\nAlways report nonreproducible errors; they may be time bombs\nNonreproducible bugs are reproducible\nBe conscious of the processing cost of your bug reports\nGive special handling to bugs related to the tools or environment\nAsk before reporting bugs against prototypes or early private versions\nDuplicate bug reports are a self-correcting problem\nEvery bug deserves its own report\nThe summary line is the most important line in the bug report\nNever exaggerate your bugs\nReport the problem clearly, but don’t try to solve it\nBe careful of your tone.

It is not the only way, but most folks who have enjoyed port for\n\nmany years have found some guidelines that help them maximize their port-\ndrinking experience. Here are just a few:\n\nLesson 1: Don’t drink straight from the bottle. If you have no glass, nor any\nother possible containers available, pour a tiny amount of port into the\npalm of your hand and sip from there. The port aroma should be smelled\nas you sip. Let the port swirl over your tongue. Don’t gulp down the port.\n\nLesson 2: Don’t drink the entire bottle. If you are drinking because you are\nthirsty, put down the port and drink a big glass of water. A small amount\nof port each time maximizes the enjoyment of the entire bottle. |\n\nLesson 3: Don’t pollute the port. If someone tells you that you ought to try a\nnew cocktail made with orange juice, seawater, and port, politely refuse.\nWith a big smile, say, “But I would enjoy a glass of port.”\n\nLesson 4: Don’t covet the port. Hoarding your port means that you will\nnever have the pleasure of gentle conversation while sipping. Port is best\nshared with friends who also enjoy a glass. Remember, they have a bottle\nsomewhere, too.\n\nYou are not holding a bottle of port in your hands. You are holding Lessons\nLearned in Software Testing, a very valuable book about software testing. This\nbook has been ripening to perfection throughout the 50 work-years of the\nauthors’ experiences. While port is for your taste buds, this book is for your\nbrain. I think that you will find any cther differences to be marginal. I have\n\n. . “mi ing experi-\nsavored this book and offer you this advice to maximize your reading exp\n\nence.\n\nLesson 1. Don’t drink straight from the bottle. Bring your own vessel to the\nreading of this book. That is, bring all of your experiences in software\ndevelopment and testing. If you have never participated in a serious\nsoftware effort, this book will be too heady for you. It will leave you\nconfused and unable to operate heavy machinery for some time. If you are\nexperienced, savor the book’s contents in the context of your own projects.\n\nLesson 2. Don’t drink the entire bottle. Don’t read this book in one sitting.\nRead a lesson or two, close the book, and decide how you respond to the.\nwords of Messrs. Kaner, Bach, and Pettichord. As you will discover, they\ncall their approach to testing “context-driven.” Only you know the context\nof your own work. You must determine where there is a fit between a\ngiven lesson and your particular work.\n\nLesson 3. Don’t pollute the port. Somebody out there is going to make a list\nof the titles of the 293 lessons contained in this book. Please don’t let it be\nyou. The heart of the book is the explanation attached to each of the\nlessons. Be warned as well that someone else will immediately try to ISO-\nify or CMM-ummify the contents. I can see the article title now, “Getting\nto CMM Level 293 using the 293 Lessons of Lessons Learned in Software\nTesting.” Argh! As the authors explain, ” ... we don’t believe in ‘Dest\npractices.’ We believe some practices are more useful than others under\nsome circumstances.” Written by pros, those statements represent the\nquintessence of attaining the state of Master-crafter of Software Testing.\n\nLesson 4. Don’t covet the port. If there ever is a book to be read with your\ncolleagues, this is it. Buy a carton-load and hand a copy out to everyone\nwho tests and to everyone who thinks that she or he manages testers. Read\na few selected lessons at a time and get together to talk about them over\ncoffee, lunch, even port! Read, ruminate, enjoy.

The SWEBOK document claims to be consensus-based. One would\nexpect such a document to carry the accumulated knowledge and wisdom\n(the accumulated lessons) of the field.\n\nHere is everything that SWEBOK has to say about exploratory testing:\n\nie Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) is being proposed as a\n\n- Perhaps the most widely practiced technique remains ad hoc testing:\ntests are derived relying on the tester skill and intuition (“exploratory”\ntesting), and on his/her experience with similar programs. While a more\nsystematic approach is advised, ad hoc testing might be useful (but only\nif the tester is really expert!) to identify special tests, not easily\n“captured” by formalized techniques. Moreover it must be reminded\nthat this technique may yield largely varying degrees of effectiveness.\n\n(SWEBOK 0.95, 2001, 5-9)\n\nHow does SWEBOK treat what it acknowledges is the field’s most widely\npracticed technique? Nothing about how to practice the technique well. Only\na statement that exploration should be done only by real experts, that other\napproaches are advised, and the suggestion that other, formalized techniques\n\nwill yield less varying degrees of effectiveness.\n\nHah!\n\nWe don’t pretend to offer a consensus document that describes our field’s\nalleged body of knowledge, but we do have a lot more to say about our field’s\nmost common practices. Rather than dismissing exploratory testing, this\nbook shows you what testing looks like through the eyes of people who use\nexploratory methods (and many other methods) in a drive to achieve\nexcellent testing under real-life conditions.\n\nWelcome to Lessons Learned in\nSoftware Testing\n\nPee ee eee eee OR eR HRT ETRE TRON ONS RH EOC HERG EE NTE O HONOR OT OE SA EAE DENSE OR EDEL CA ESTEE CAO OES DOEOA TOT EE EDI DONSE ELON EERO ERASE PED LOS HERE ONTEOEHE TEES DORE OE EASA EEO E ROE Oneaenespens\n\nThis book is about software development as we’ve experienced it. We’ve had\na combined total of 50 to 60 years of development experience (depending on\nhow you count). We’ve been at this for a while. We’ve seen a lot of great work\nand a lot of not-so-great work.\n\nThis book is not about how software engineering might be in a tidier and\nmore controlled world. We're writing about the world as we’ve worked in it.\n\nIn our world, software development teams often work under ambitious\ndeadlines, discovering what needs to be done at the same time as they’re\ndiscovering how to do it. Sometimes their approaches are more formal,\nsometimes less. It depends on a wide range of circumstances.\n\nWe follow the context-driven approach in software testing. We expect that a\nmethod that works wonderfully under some circumstances will not work\nunder others. Rather than talk about best practices, we talk about practices\nthat are well-suited to the context at hand. We discuss the context-driven\napproach at the end of the book, but in essence, context-driven testing looks\nat the “what” of testing (the techniques, tools, strategies, and so on) in terms\nof “who,” “when,” “where,” “why,” and “what if.” _\n\nOur goal is to match our selection of practices to the circumstances at hand in\na way that achieves excellent testing. We don’t expect to achieve great testing\nby taking over the project, nor by stamping our feet and telling the project\nmanager (or executives) how Real Professionals would run the project. We\ndon’t expect to achieve great testing by intimidating programmers, nor by\nbeing obsequious to them. We don’t expect to do great testing by filling out\nthousands of little pieces of paper (or comparable electronic records), nor by\nwasting everyone else’s time on unnecessary processes.\n\nWe don’t have a political or a bureaucratic or a formal-methods recipe for\ngreat testing.\n\nThat recipe doesn’t exist!\n\nWe think great testing involves skillful technical work (searching for defects)\nand accurate, persuasive communication.\n\nThe skilled search is always exploratory. There’s an infinite amount of testing\nto do, and a tiny amount of time in which to do just a little bit of that infinity.\nEvery test we do, every document we write, every meeting we attend takes\ntime away from running other tests that could expose a key defect. Facing\nthat constraint, we optimize our testing processes so that they take advantage\nof our ever-growing knowledge of the product, its market, its applications,\nand its weaknesses. What we learn today gets reflected in more powerful\ntests tomorrow. |\n\nEven if:\n\nm the product is well specified, and\nm the specification accurately reflects a requirements document, and\n\nm the requirements document accurately represents the actual needs of the\nproduct’s stakeholders\n\n(have you ever been on a project where all these “even if’s” were true?); we\nwill still learn a lot about how to test the product while we are testing it. In\nparticular, as we discover errors, we learn how this group of programmers\ncan go wrong. The specifications tell us about how the program is supposed\nto work when it is coded correctly. They don’t tell us what mistakes to antici-\npate, nor how to design tests to find them. At that task, our key task, we get\nbetter from the start to the end of the project, on every project.\n\nNo matter what it looks like from the outside, whenever we are testing with\nour brains engaged, our work is exploratory.\n\nWho This Book Is For\n\nThis book is for anyone who tests software, anyone who manages testers, and\nanyone who has to deal with testers in their software development projects.\nThat includes project managers and executives.\n\nThe primary reader that we have in mind, the “you” in this book, has been\ntesting for a few years and might recently have been promoted to a\nsupervisory role. We hope that you'll see a lot in this book that matches your\nexperience, that you'll gain new insights from our lessons, that you'll find\nlessons that are useful for quoting to your manager, that you'll like a few of\nour statements so much that you'll photocopy them and stick them on the\n\neNO R eee R eee ten eH eR CRM TORRE ORE RHE OLE SOO OETA O LOR UN EA TOT SHEN SEEN OEOEPEOEDENGEONOEHS EAD EDONOEER OLA pases\n\noutside of your cubicle, and maybe that you'll react to at least one statement\nso strongly that you'll stick a copy on the middle of your dart board. (We\n\nwant to stimulate thought, not only agreement.)\n\nNewcomers to testing (and those of you who are just applying for a testing\njob) won’t have as many occasions to feel that you’ve already experienced\nwhat we’re writing about. For you, this book might provide some early\ninsights and warnings, giving you a good taste of what issues testers face.\n\nHint: If you are absolutely new to testing and you are looking for a book to\nstudy from in order to prepare for a job interview, this is the wrong book. If\nthis is the only book available to you, pay your most careful attention to the\nchapters on “Testing Techniques” and “Your Career in Software Testing.” If\nyou have a choice of books, we suggest the first five chapters of Testing\nComputer Software (Kaner et al., 1993).\n\nProgrammers, project managers, and executives who have to work with\ntesters will find this book a useful source of ideas for setting your\nexpectations of the testing group. We hope that it will help you evaluate and\ndiscuss your concerns with the testing group if you disagree with their\npolicies or feel that they are spending their time unwisely.\n\nWhat This Book Is About\n\nTO SRR ORO e CROs eae EON OE Hae E DONE ARO EDC H OOD en Ones euen oer anesensatarunes\n\nOver the years, we’ve learned many useful practices and helpful ways of\nevaluating situations. Our conclusions are based on experience. We\nsummarize much of our experience in this book, in a series of short, readable\n\ndescriptions of a few hundred lessons.\n\nWe adopted several criteria for including a lesson in this book. They are:\n\n= The lesson should be useful or should provide insight.\n\n_& The lesson should pass the 90-minutes-thinking-alone test. A lesson is not\n\nworth including in the book if almost anyone who thought about testing\nfor 90 minutes of undistracted time could come up with it.\n\n= The lesson must be based on our actual experience. At least one of us\n(preferably all three of us) had to have successfully applied the advice we\ngive. At least two of us had to have been burned by attempting to follow a\npractice we criticize. (Note: Sometimes, we come to different conclusions,\nbased on different experiences. Occasionally, you'll see that we choose to\nprovide two viewpoints rather than one. Even if only one view is presented,\nyou cannot assume that all three of us fully agree with it—in the event of\ndisagreement, we are likely, among the three of us, to defer to the one or\ntwo who have the most extensive experience with a given situation.)\n\njejtdclaadae sO :\n\nca Lessons should be tempered by the experiences of our colleagues. We've\nbeen collecting detailed experience reports at the Los Altos Workshops on\nSoftware Testing, the Software Test Managers Round Tables, the Workshops\non Heuristic and Exploratory Techniques, the Austin Workshops on Test\nAutomation, the Patterns of Software Testing Workshops, the Workshop on\nModel-Based Automated Testing, Systems Effectiveness Management\nGroups, at dozens of software testing conferences, and at less formal peer\ncross-trainings (such as the annual Consultants’ Camps in Crested Butte).\n\nc= The lesson should be brief and to the point but easily understood.\n\nm= A lesson can be longer, but only to the extent needed to explain how to do\nsomething or to provide a useful tool. Long descriptions and detailed\nbackground information are for the textbooks.\n\nc Lessons should be self-contained. You should be able to start reading\nanywhere in the book.\n\nm The collection of lessons should give you a feel for how we do and think.\nabout testing. |\n\nWhat This Book Is Not\n\nPOR OROEHE REDE RSTO TOT OE SHES OHA TODO COTO EOEHSHONSTOTEEOTHAOEDSTORONOHOEO SHEESH OH ON OTOH SHOE SECTS SHOUD ED OHOHONOUOEOE HODES ONO DEEONONOSDODEH EE EE SEES O SEER SPER OHO HSER ERE EH SPERHED SEN EHR OES\n\nThis book is not a comprehensive guide to software testing.\n\nThis book is not a collection of lessons that are always true. These are our\nlessons, based on our experiences. We believe these are broadly applicable,\nbut some lessons that have been useful and important in our careers may not\nwork for you. You have to use your own judgment. As a particular limiter on\nthe generality of this work, we should note that we’ve worked more on the\ndevelopment of software for the mass market and on contract-specified\nsoftware than we have on software developed for in-house use. Our\nexperience with life-critical software and embedded software is limited.\n\nThis book is not a collection of best practices. In fact, we don’t believe in\n\n“best practices.” We believe some practices are more useful than others under\nsome circumstances. We are concerned that many things sold as best\n\npractices are pushed (and applied) uncritically, to situations that aren’t\nappropriate to them.\n\nHow to Use This Book\n\nWe structured this book to make it easy for you to skim it or flip through it,\nrather than trying to read it from start to finish. At some point (we hope),\nyou'll find a nugget, an idea that is very appealing to you. We cannot\n\nrecommend that you apply this idea uncritically. (Our lessons are not best\npractices.) Instead, we urge you to evaluate the lesson in terms of its\n\nappropriateness to your situation.\nHere are some questions that might help you perform that evaluation:\n\n© Under what circumstances would an application of this lesson work in\nyour company?\n\nmo Under what circumstances would the application not work?\n\nm Has anyone you know tried anything like this lesson before? What\nhappened? Why? What’s different about your current project from that\nperson’s project? Should that difference matter?\n\nti Who is most likely to benefit from the attempt to apply this lesson?\n\nm1 Who is most likely to be disadvantaged as a result of an attempt to apply\nthe lesson?\n\no What will you learn from attempting to apply this lesson?\n\nm Trying anything new adds risk. Does it make sense to see how well this\nlesson would apply to your company by running a pilot study, a situation\nin which you try out the lesson without committing yourself to it, or\nunder a situation of low risk? Is it feasible to conduct a pilot study in your\ncompany, on (or in the service of) your current project? 7\n\n= How will you know whether your application of this lesson worked? If it\ndid work, how will you know whether the success came more from the\nintrinsic value of the lesson, which will last as you keep applying it, than\nfrom your enthusiasm in trying out the idea?\n\nci What are the best and worst things that could happen to you as a result of\ntrying to apply this lesson? |\n\nci What are the best and worst things that could happen to another\nstakeholder, such as a user or another member of the development team?\n\n© What if a key person in your company disagrees with a lesson that you\nwant to follow? How will you overcome their objections and then sell it to\nthem?\n\nWe Hope This Book Stimulates\nConversations and Debates\n\neevee rene renarecarseneesesrerssararneee\neer err reTnnrErr re rare rrnrrrrrererererrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrirrrrrrriririrrirrrererir rir hae\n\nThis book draws sharp contrasts between our views and some others.

The authors. —\n\nYou. The reader.\n\nA fault is an error, a mistake in the implementation or design of the program.\nAs we use the term, an error is a fault. |\n\nA failure is the misbehavior of the program, resulting from the program\nencountering a fault. |\n\nFailures occur under conditions. For example, a program will crash when it\nattempts to divide by zero. The fault in this case is in the code that allows\ndivision by zero. The failure is the crash. But you don’t see a failure unless\nthe critical variable in the division has the value zero. That variable, having\na value of zero, is the critical condition that must be met for the failure to\noccur.\n\nA symptom is like a failure but less serious. For example, if the program has a\nmemory leak, it might start slowing down long before it fails with an out-\nof-memory error message. The slowdown is a symptom of an underlying\nproblem (memory shortage) that is not directly visible.\n\nThe word bug is a catch-all term. It could refer to anything wrong with the\nsoftware. Someone reporting a bug might describe a fault, a failure, or a\nlimitation of the program that makes it less valuable to a stakeholder.\n\nIf we define quality as value to some person (Weinberg, 1998, 2.i.),a bug report\n1S a statement that some person considers the product less valuable\nbecause of the thing being described as a bug.\n\ne companies don't allow the words defect oy\nr bug-related memos.\n\nThe word defect carries a leg\n\nWrong With The Product.

They will mark the bug resolved (fixed, deferred,\n\nnot reproducible, works as designed, and so on). |\nBlack box testing. Testing the external behavior of the program, by feeding the\nprogram inputs and examining the outputs. In typical black box testing,\nthe tester has no knowledge of the internals of the code and Is instead\nmore familiar with the explicit and implicit product requirements, such as\nthe ways the program will be used, the types of data likely to be fed to the\nprogram, any regulatory issues associated with the problem the software is\n\nattempting to solve or help solve, and the hardware and software\nenvironments in which the software will run. _ -\n\nBehavioral testing.

A standard suite of tests applied toa\nnew build. The tests look for fundamental instability or key things missing\nor broken. If the build fails these tests, you do not test it any further.\nInstead, you keep testing the old build or wait for the next one.\n\nProject manager.

That’s the question we address in\n\nor trivial at first glance, but it’s not. |\n\nA role is a relationship. That means you don’t control your role, but you can\nnegotiate it.

As they do their\nresearch on the product and how the people who have to read the\ndocumentation will use the product, they will learn things that you don’t\nknow. If you have a good relationship with the writers, they'll alert you to\nnew features, new uses, holes in your test plan, and to the bugs they find.\nSome of those bugs would never be reported unless a particular writer\nknows that a particular tester cares.\nrm Teclmical support.

Even if “verify that the program\nworks” is handed to you as your mission, advise your client that such\nverification is impossible. It’s hideously expensive.

The problem\n\nis that when testers control the release, they also must bear the full\nresponsibility for the quality of the product. The rest of the team will relax a\nlittle bit, or maybe a lot. If any bug sneaks by the testers and out the gate, the\nrest of the team can (and will) shrug and blame the testers. After all, why did\nthe testers ship such a buggy product? On the other hand, if the testers delay\nthe release, they bear intense scrutiny and pressure for being such quality\nfanatics. |\n\nUltimately, it’s the people who control the project who are best equipped to\nbear the responsibility to release the product. However, most highly effective\nprojects we’ve seen use some kind of consensus approach.

Some testers feel that their mission is simply to fine\nvariances between the product and the specifications. Anything beyon 4\nthat—such as usability problems, requirements problems, data quality, an\nsupportability concerns—are “not my job.” We urge you to take a more\nexpansive view. All other things being equal, your mission should be to 4\ninform the team, to the best of your ability, about any problems that coul\nadversely impact the value of the product. For this reason, excellent test\nteams include a diverse group of people who collectively understand the\nwhole equation of the product: how it will be designed, manufactured,\nmarketed, sold, used, serviced, and upgraded.\n\nAnother temptation to say “not my job” comes when you're placed in a\ndifficult testing situation. Your colleagues on the programming side may\nwrite crummy specs. They may deliver their code so late that you don’t have\ntime for a reasonable test process. They may claim that an important problem\nyou've found is actually a figment of your imagination. It’s tempting to\nrefuse to test under those circumstances. You could say it’s not your job to\ninterpret ambiguous specifications or to test something in such a rush. In\nsevere cases, that may well be the right thing to do, but consider first whether\nyour expectations are realistic and consider whether there’s an alternative\nway to get what you need. If you adopt the philosophy that it’s your job to\nmake a reasonable effort to adapt and improvise, the programmers are more\nlikely to consider you a boon instead of a burden.

We propose an alternative view. Testers don’t complain; they offer\nevidence. Testers don’t like to break things; they like to dispel the illusion\nthat things work. Testers don’t enjoy giving bad news; they enjoy freeing\ntheir clients from the thrall of false belief. Our view is that thinking like a\ntester means practicing epistemology.

This view makes testing seems like a\nstraightforward comparison activity and ignores the fact that some clever\nperson must design the tests and determine the expectations. Guess what? That\ntest designer almost never has access to an authoritative guide to what\nshould be tested, let alone what should be expected. And what guides are\navailable are subject to interpretation. In real life, most test design is based on\ninferences or taken from experience that the tester infers is relevant.\nMoreover, these inferences change over time. To think like a tester is to be\nadept at the art of exploratory inference.\n\nExploratory inference may sound like a strange idea. It means one idea\nleading to another and another in ways you can’t predict in advance. For a\ngreat introduction to exploratory inference, see Proofs and Refutations: The\nLogic of Mathematical Discovery (Lakatos 1976). The great thing about this book\nis how Lakatos shows that the process of mathematical and scientific\nreasoning is exploratory, not scripted. Even mathematicians reason actively\n\nle\nhey\nble\n}\n\n{\n\nat\nin\n\nre RP AO\n\nand searchingly, rather than through the application of dull formulae.

But we believe four\nmajor categories of thinking are worth highlighting:\n\n= Technical thinking. The ability to model technology and understand causes\nand effects. This includes things like knowledge of relevant technical facts\nand the ability to use tools and predict the behavior of systems.\n\n1 Creative thinking. The ability to generate ideas and see possibilities. You\nwill test only in ways that you can imagine testing. You will look only for\nproblems that you imagine can exist.\n\nci Critical thinking. The ability to evaluate ideas and make inferences. This\nincludes the ability to detect and eliminate errors from your thinking, to\nrelate product observations to quality criteria, and to build a compelling\ncase for a particular belief or suggested course of action.\n\nci Practical thinking. The ability to put ideas into practice. This ability\nincludes such skills as applying test tools and making test techniques and\neffort fit within the scope of the project.\n\nOverall, thinking like a tester leads you to believe that things may not be as\nthey seem. However things are, they could be different. We find that when\nthe test process fails in the most damaging ways, the root cause is most likely\nto be tunnel vision. In other words, it’s not that we ran 10,000 tests and\nshould have run 10,001. It’s that we failed to imagine an entire category of\ntest; testing we wouldn't have performed even if we had twice the time and\n\nresources.\n\nBlack box testing is not ignorance-based\ntesting.\n\nPer ecer oan srerccererensserasvaerareraresesrsrsr see « . sevoreaocesroreressererersreresesere ss ery oe adeveverowverebenerenevauecs\n. eveverereee Cen ererersuececoes\nsvevarevevevcece . .\n\nSOevenee tvewesacarsenevene\n\nBlack box testing means that knowledge of the internals of the product doesn’t\nplay a significant part in your testing. Most testers are black box testers. To\ndo black box testing well, learn about the user, her expectations and needs,\n\n| PAEESAASPN SAA Gey ed [lith S WOE\n\nthe technology, the configurations the software will run on, the other\nsoftware that this software will interact with, the data the software must\nmanage, the development process, and so on. The advantage of black box\ntesting is that you probably think differently than the programmer, and, thus,\n\nare likely to anticipate risks that the programmer missed.\n\nThe black box emphasis on knowledge of the software’s user and\nenvironment is not to everyone’s liking. We’ve even heard this described as\nignorance-based testing because the tester is and stays ignorant of the\nunderlying code. We think that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of\nthe role of the testing group. We don’t object to a tester learning about how a\nproduct works. The more you learn about a product, and the more ways in\nwhich you know it, the better you will be able to test it. But if your primary\nfocus is on the source code and tests you can derive from the source code,\nyou will be covering ground the programmer has probably covered already,\nand with less knowledge of that code than she had.\n\nLots of things you do with a product that aren’t tests can help you learn\nabout it. You can tour the product, see what it’s made of and how it works.\nThis is invaluable, but it’s not quite testing. The difference between a tester\nand a tourist is that a tester’s efforts are devoted to evaluating the product,\nnot merely witnessing it. Although it’s not necessary to predict in advance\nhow the software should behave, an activity that puts the product through its\npaces doesn’t become a test unless and until you apply some principle or\nprocess that will identify some kind of problem if one exists.\n\nea 7% All tests are an attempt to answer some\n\n“ , question.\n\nPOPE Pere ee eee Eee R eR eee Reese Eee ET EROS eR OTTO RTE T Eee EERE LEDEHEHSEOSEL ESOT STS ISTHE EET OOD ENG SOLO U OEE ONEDOHELOTOE OEE EE SPEDE OLDER O DSO ES EE EHD ODA DER EeePeNereEesensonerereseneses\n\nAll tests are experiments performed to answer a question about the\nrelationship between what a product is and what it should be. Sometimes\nyou aren’t entirely aware of the questicns you're asking. That might be fine if\nyou're looking for only the obvious problems. In many cases, though, bugs\ndon’t jump out at you with a “report me” sign in flashing neon. A product\ncould misbehave in ways that the user will find obvious, even if you (the\ntester) are oblivious. In any test activity, ask yourself what questions should\ndrive your evaluation strategy. Otherwise, you’re more tourist than tester.\n\n“os All testing is based on models.\nYou may have a mental picture in your mind when you design tests. Or, you\nmay be working with a list of features or a diagram of some kind. You have\nsome concept of who the users are and what they care about. All of these are\nmodels. No matter what, your tests will be based primarily on your models\nof the product, not the actual product. A flawed model results in flawed tests.\nLearning a new way to model a product is like learning a new way to see it.\n\nStudy modeling. You will test better as you become more skillful in the art of\nmodeling. Textbooks and classes about requirements analysis and software\narchitecture can help. A wonderful way to gain skill in all kinds of modeling\nis to study systems thinking. See An Introduction to General Systems Thinking:\nSilver Anniversary Edition.

We think this is a\nhelpful sense, but more as a starting point than a resting point.\n\nApart from the fact that intuition is often strongly biased, the real trouble\ncomes when you try to get other people, such as programmers and\nmanagers, to take your bug reports and quality assessments seriously. Unless\nyour findings are based on intuition that all parties share, your work is liable\n\nto be dismissed.\n\nTherefore, we recommend using intuition as a guide, but not a justification.\nWhen you are tempted to think “this is a bug because it’s obviously a bug”\nconsider reframing that to “this is a bug because I observe that the product\nbehaves in a way that violates requirements X, Y, and Z, and those\n\nrequirements are valued by my clients.”\n\nOeU eee e EEOC e rere ee Teer rer er ere eee re rerersy\nTVS eee rece nareeneeeeanne\nDae orevenes\n\nworereeseeeverares\nPAP PP eee See SO PURUSUSULY SPO SeSU SOS SLV SPECIE TOCLaCirist tre eee\n\nTo test something well, you have to work with it. You must get ito it. This is\nan exploratory process, even if you havea perfect description of the product.\n\n: \\\nx :\n\nstereh\n\nUntil you explore that specification, either in your mind’s eye or by working\nwith the product itself, the tests you conceive will be superficial. Even after\nyou explore enough of the product to understand it deeply, there is still the\nmatter of exploring for problems. Because all testing is sampling, and your\nsample can never be complete, exploratory thinking has a role throughout\nthe test project as you seek to maximize the value of testing.\n\nBy exploration, we mean purposeful wandering: navigating through a space\nwith a general mission, but without a prescripted route. Exploration involves\ncontinuous learning and experimenting. There’s a lot of backtracking,\nrepetition, and other processes that look like waste to the untrained eye.\nPerhaps for that reason, the importance of exploration to testing, and for that\nmatter software engineering, is often downplayed and even derided by\nwriters and consultants in our field.\n\nIt’s beyond the scope of this book to prove our assertion about the central\nimportance of exploration. One way you can experience it vividly is to watch\nyourself solve a complicated jigsaw puzzle without looking at the picture on\nthe box or play a game of Twenty Questions or Mastermind. Notice how\nmuch more difficult it would be to succeed in these activities, and how much\nless rewarding, with strictly pre-scripted behavior.\n\nFor a look at how disciplined exploration is used in another field much like\ntesting, sociology, see The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for\nQualitative Research (Glaser and Strauss 1999), and Basics of Qualitative\nResearch, 2nd Edition (Strauss, Anselm, and Corbin 1998). If you like statistics,\ntry Exploratory Data Analysis (Tukey 1977).\n\nExploring is detective work. It’s an open-ended search. Think of exploration\nas moving through a space. It involves forward, backward, and lateral\nthinking:\n\n= Forward thinking. Work from what you know to what you don’t know;\nwhat you see toward what you haven’t yet seen. Seek ramifications and\nside effects. Example: I see a print menu item. I'll click on it and see what\nhappens.\n\n— Backward thinking. Work from what you suspect or imagine back toward\nwhat you know, trying to confirm or refute your conjectures. Example: I\nwonder if there’s a way to print this document? I'll look through the\nmenus and see whether there’s a print item. (Solow 1990)\n\n= Lateral thinking. Let your work be distracted by ideas that pop into your\nhead, exploring tangents then returning to the main thread (de Bono\n1970). Example: That’s:an interesting graphic. Hey, I think I’Il print some\ncomplex graphics and see what happens.\n\nThe exploratory process works even if you don’t have a product to test. You\ncan explore a set of documents or interview a programmer, using the same\nthought processes. You make progress by building richer, better mental\nmodels of the product. These models then allow you to design effective tests.\n\nsco) Use the logic of abductive inference to\no . discover conjectures.\n\neT OOO E ENON OTE TO ER ENS ETAT ATOR TREE TREN ETAT ETO T ESET OORT AYE T EET OTHE U ETOH YET AE OE HEAT OT ATATA ENSUES OTEUE ERE OEOTESR TAPE TO URES TEED EPOHOUS SER CLabarenarernvaveerereravaterauneesteve®\n\nAbductive inference, also known as hypothetical induction, is a fancy term\nfor a vital form of reasoning that testers use every day: reasoning to the best\nexplanation. It goes like this:\n\n1. You gather some data and want to make sense of it.\n\n2. You construct a variety of explanations that might account for the data.\n\n3. You seek more data that will help you corroborate or refute each of the\nexplanations.\n\n4. You choose the most coherent explanation that accounts for all the important\ndata from among your options, or if there is not enough evidence to justify\nany conclusion, continue the search.\n\nAbductive inference is a basic method of science and of testing. Doctors use it\nwhen diagnosing illness. Testers use it when making judgments about what a\nproduct is and is not and how it should or should not work. If you want to\nmake better abductive inferences:\n\nGather more data.\n\nGather more important data.\n\nGather more reliable data.\n\nUnderstand the causes and effects that apply to the data.\n\nIdentify more and better explanations that could account for the data.\nGather more data that would refute each explanation.\n\nGather more data that would differentiate among explanations.\n\nOoo 8 0 Ob gs Oo gQ\n\nDon’t settle on an explanation unless it accounts for all the important data\nand is clearly better supported than the others.\n\nRS SKBRIG) (ECS LIB GO aT ANWAR?

The method is based on\nthe premise that a scientist can never be absolutely certain of any particular\nfact or theory about nature. Everything is a conjecture. Some conjectures, like\nthe existence of gravity, are very strong. What makes them conjecture, instead\nof absolutely certain fact, is that it’s possible to imagine new information\nthat, if it existed, would cause us to reject the conjecture. Popper noticed that\nthough we can’t prove that a conjecture is true, it may be possible to prove\nthat it’s false. Therefore, he suggested that the only confidence a given\nconjecture deserves would come from trying hard to refute it and not being\nable to do so.\n\nThis method of making conjectures and trying to refute them applies to\ntesting in three important ways: :\n\n= It’s more powerful to test for the purpose of showing that the product\nfails, than it is to show that it works. When you want to know whether a\nproduct works well, find ways to refute that it works well, and your\ntesting will probably be better.\n\nmc A well-formed belief about the software (how it behaves, how good it is,\nand so on) should be falsifiable. That means we should be able to imagine\nnew information that would contradict our belief. Otherwise, our belief is\nnothing more than faith. Faith is fine in private life but is poisonous for\ntesting.\n\nmr Beware of tests that purport to validate or certify a product in a way that\ngoes beyond the specific tests you ran. No amount of testing provides\ncertainty about the quality of the product.\n\nA requirement is a quality or condition\n\n. that matters to someone who matters.\n\nPOPE eR Te PEEP ETee Pere rere re ceric ec reece ee crcr cree rece re ce srerererverereseerrererrere rr er errr rrvee rer ee veer er er ere vere erreerreeee Ter eererereTerrrerrerrer tiie titer i ieee\n\nYou can choose from many definitions of “requirement.” This definition\nworks well for testers. As you test, you must become aware of whose opinion\n\ni\n\n| Giapiar oe Tig (Ue @ tertiay 1 27\n\nabout quality matters (not everyone matters equally). Then learn what they\nwant in the product and what they don’t want. This view of requirements\nmakes no distinction between software engineering “requirements” (a set of\nstatements published in a “requirements document” and approved by people\nwith approval authority) and any other kind of specification. For the\npurposes of testing, any quality or condition that the product should exhibit\nor fulfill is a requirement.\n\nDifferent clients want different things from the product, they don’t\nnecessarily know what they want, and what they want changes over time.\nThis makes our job more interesting.

In the best cases we’ve\nexperienced, requirements documentation (which includes any and all kinds\nof product specifications, use cases, vision documents, and so on) has been\nincomplete and ambiguous, even though it was informative and helpful. In\nthe worst cases we’ve seen, the documentation was incomplete, ambiguous,\nuninformative, and unhelpful.\n\nA tester who treats project documentation (explicit specifications of the\nproduct) as the sole source of requirements is crippling his test process. In any\ntest team we were managing, insistence on such behavior would be a firing\n\noffense.\n\nRequirements information comes to us primarily in three ways:\n\n= Conference.

It’s\nthe testing that matters, not how you parse the testing into packages you call\ntests. The testing is anything that involves at least these four activities:\n\nm Configure. Prepare the product for the test. Put it into the right starting\nstate. Otherwise, your test results may be tainted by rogue variables.\n\nOperate. Feed the product data. Give it commands. Interact with it in some\nway. Otherwise, it just sits there, and what you’re doing is reviewing, not\n\nThe concept of a test that stands self-\n\ntesting. |\nObserve.

Otherwise, you will either report no problems, or\nyou will just pass the data through to your clients, who will have to\nperform the evaluation themselves.\n\nTest creation may take many forms. Don’t get too hung up on form, just\nmake sure these four activities are happening.

The word\ncomes from Greek, meaning “serving to discover.” Heuristics are not\nguaranteed to lead to the right answer or the best answer, but they are useful\nnonetheless. A seminal book on using heuristics is How to Solve It (Polya 1957).\n\nBecause the number of possible test cases is infinite, we are stuck making\nguesses about what small population of test cases will be effective under the\ntime and budget constraints we face. Experienced testers collect and share\ntesting heuristics that improve the quality of their guesses. A good set of\nheuristics helps us generate tests very quickly. Here are some examples of\ntesting heuristics:\n\nc3 Test at the boundaries. Boundaries are more likely to reveal ambiguities in\nthe specification.\n\nci Test every error message. Error-handling code tends to be weaker than\nmainstream functionality.\n\n= Test configurations that are different from the programmer’s. The programmer\nwill already be biased toward making sure his own configuration works.\n\nm= Run tests that are annoying to set up. Easy-to-set-up tests are more likely to\nbe performed, all other things being equal.\n\n© Avoid redundant tests. If a test is truly duplicating another test, what new\nvalue is it giving you?\n\nTo use heuristics wisely, remember one thing: There is no wisdom in\nheuristics. The wisdom is with you. All the heuristic does is make a\nsuggestion for your consideration. Blindly following heuristics that you don’t\nunderstand is not good testing practice. As you collect heuristics, try to\nunderstand the reasoning behind each one and the conditions under which\n\nit’s more or less likely to work.\n\nYou can’t avoid bias, but you can\nmanage it.\n\nYou are biased. That causes you to select some tests with greater likelihood\nthan other tests.

This is a\nminor bias, perhaps, but it’s still a bias. More ominous is the fact that most\ntesters are biased in favor of testing the most visible functions, whether or\nnot they are important functions. Also, most testers are biased toward users\nwho think like them and toward very simple and very outrageous input as\nopposed to realistic input of moderate complexity.\n\nHere are a few popular biases:\n\nm Assimilation bias. 1 am more likely to interpret future test results as\ngenerally confirming my opinion of the product. .\n\nca Confirmation bias. 1am more likely to pay attention to test results that\nreally do confirm my opinion of the product.\n\nm= Availability bias. If | can readily bring to mind a scenario in which a user\nwill behave in a certain way, I will also tend to think that behavior is more\nlikely. , |\n\ncm Primacy bias. I will give more credence to the first observations I make.\n\nm3. Recency bias. I will give more credence to the most recent observations I\nmake. |\n\n= Framing effect. My reaction to a bug report is strongly related to how it’s\n_ phrased, regardless of what it means. |\n\nProminence bias. I will give more weight to the opinions of users I happen\n\nto know.\n\n= Representativeness bias. I expect that small problems probably have small\ncauses, whereas large problems require large causes.\n\nYou can’t avoid these biases. They are, to a large extent, hard-wired into our\n\n_ brains. What you can do is manage the biases. For instance, just by studying\n\nbiases and practicing at becoming aware of them, you can become better\nequipped to compensate for them in your thinking. Diversity is also a\nprotection against too much bias. If multiple testers brainstorm tests together,\nthat can minimize the impact of any one tester’s biases.\n\nBy definition, a heuristic is also a bias. We use heuristics because they bias us\n\n. in ways that we hope will be helpful.\n\n2.

This\nis one of the quickest ways for a novice tester to improve, because knowing\nyou can be fooled is an attitude, not a matter of special skill or knowledge.\nThe problem for novice testers is that for them this principle is just an article\nof faith (“I’m told that I’m supposed to think I can be fooled. Whatever .. . “);\nwhereas the senses and reflexes of experienced testers have been awakened\nand sharpened through the pain of actually screwing up (“I remember the\ngreat recall of ‘94.

After you’ve made sense of a product or\nfeature, you have a mental map of it, and your mind doesn’t work so hard.\nThis can be a problem for testers.

In our opinion, this is a bad practice. It reflects a fundamental\nmisunderstanding of testing and the people who do it well.\n\nWhen evaluating a test process, look first at the quality of the testers on the\nproject. Look at how they think and how that affects what they do. Only then\ncan you be in a position to evaluate the work products they produce.\n\nYou can 't master testing unless you\n~ reinvent it.\n\n- Don’t reinvent the wheel. Wait a minute. Isn’t the wheel the single most\nreinvented thing in history? Isn’t that a good thing? After all, we drive on\npneumatic tires, these days, not granite disks. There are thousands, if not\nmillions of variations on the wheel theme. Maybe that’s a lesson. It seems to\nus there are at least two reasons to reinvent something: to adapt it to anew\ncontext, and to learn how it works. Mastery requires both.\n\nWe have colleagues who advise students of testing to avoid reinventing tests\nor testing ideas. We disagree. That’s like learning a science by avoiding\nexperimentation. It’s okay to learn from other thinkers. We think it’s\nimportant to learn that way—check the title of this book if you doubt that.\nBut if that’s the only way you learn, then you can never become a master of\nthe testing craft. You'll be a technician, nothing more. Following instructions\nwon’t get you to mastery any more than following an interstate highway\nwill get you to Mars. We encourage that you learn testing the way great\nmechanics or great programmers learn: Take things apart, ponder how they\nwork, and put them back together in new ways. Don’t restrict yourself to\nbeing a steward of received wisdom; be the author of your own wisdom.\n\nEarly in your learning process, your reinvented tests, ideas, techniques, or\ndocuments aren’t very good. That’s normal. Just keep your brain turned on,\nwatch other testers, study, and continually evaluate how your ideas pan out.\nIf you want to be good at this, you have to practice.\n\nWe've been at this for years, and we are still reinventing, still reworking old\nideas. Every colleague we respect is working toward mastery that way.\n\n1@s\n\nW\n\nting Techniques\n\nhat does a tester do? In the first two chapters, our answer has been sage and\nlearned, we hope, but also rather abstract. It’s time to get more specific.\nWhere do tests come from? What do tests look like? This chapter is about\ntesting techniques, but we won't define every technique in detail. For that,\nyou'll have to go to the main textbooks on testing. We suggest Kaner, Falk,\nand Nguyen (1993), Jorgensen (1995), Beizer (1990), Marick (1995), Collard\n\n(forthcoming), and Hendrickson (forthcoming). Whittaker and Jorgensen’s\n\narticles (1999 and 2000) and Whittaker (2002) also provide useful ideas.\n\nThis chapter reads differently from the other chapters in the book for two\n\nreasons.\n\n© First, the essential insight in this chapter is a structural one, a classification\nsystem that organizes the rest of the material. We placed this in the first\nlesson. The next five lessons list several techniques, but the primary\npurpose of those lists is to support the classification system. We provide\nthis detail to make it easier for you to imagine how to apply the\nclassification system to your work.\nThis classification system synthesizes approaches that we have\nindividually used and taught. Use this structure to decide which\ntechniques are available and appropriate for a given problem and for\ngenerating ideas about combining techniques to attack a given problem\n\nefficiently.\n\nThe lists of techniques sometimes cont\ndescription, but we saw that as optiona\n\nain detail beyond a quick\n1. The level of detail is\n\nYeats wane\n\n}\n\n¥\n$\ni\n\n7 SCE SS UN SEU UIN ED ETINES UO PIU A Gai Eo RIN Ge\n\nsrs\n\nintentionally uneven. We expect that you'll learn more about the details of\nmost techniques in other books and classes.\n\nm1 Second, even though this is not primarily a how-to chapter on techniques, we\ncouldn’t bring ourselves to write a chapter on testing techniques without\ndescribing at least a few techniques in enough detail that you could actually\nuse them. Hence the Addendum, which describes five techniques that we find\nuseful, in ways that have worked well for our students in professional-level\nseminars and university courses on software testing.\n\nOur primary goal in this chapter is to present a classification system for\ntesting techniques. We call it the Five-fold Testing System. Any testing that you\ndo can be described in terms of five dimensions: | |\n\nm1 Testers. Who does the testing. For example, user testing is focused on\n\ntesting by members of your target market, people who would normally\nuse the product. oe |\n\n= Coverage. What gets tested. For example, in function testing, you test every\nfunction. |\n\n= Potential problems. Why you're testing (what risk you're testing for). For\nexample, testing for extreme value errors.\n\n= Activities. How you test. For example: exploratory testing.\n\nm1 Evaluation. How to tell whether the test passed or failed. For example,\ncomparison to a known good result,\n\nWe also describe a few techniques in detail in this chapter and present\ninsights about the use of a few others, but our primary goal is to explain the\n\nclassification system.\n\nAll testing involves all five dimensions. A testing technique focuses your\nattention on one or a few dimensions, leaving the others open to your\njudgment. You can combine a technique that is focused on one dimension\nwith techniques focused on the other dimensions to achieve the result you\nwant. You might call the result of such a combination a new technique (some\npeople do), but we think the process of thinking is more useful than adding\nanother name to the ever-expanding list of inconsistently defined techniques\nin use in our field. Our classification scheme can help you make those\ncombinations consciously and thoughtfully.\n\n. Ce vere raat WEY\n\nNia Ge Gad ee\nTesting tasks are often assi\n\n. . . ned o\nfive dimensions.

It’s wise to do function testing before doing more complex tests\nthat involve several functions.

Test several functions together, to see\nhow they work together. :\n\nMenu tour. Walk through all of the menus and dialogs in a GUI Product\ntaking every available choice. | |\n\nDomain testing. A domain is a (mathematical) set that includes all possible\nvalues of a variable of a function. In domain testing, you identify the\nfunctions and the variables. The variables might be input or output\nvariables. (The mathematical distinction between input domains and\noutput ranges is not relevant here, because the testing analysis is the same\nfor both cases.) For each variable, you partition its set of possible values\ninto equivalence classes and pick a small number of representatives\n(typically boundary cases) from each class. The assumption of the method\nis that if you test with a few excellent representatives of a class, you'll find\nmost or all of the bugs that could be found by testing every member of the\nclass. Note that in contrast to function testing, the primary element of\ninterest is the variable rather than the function. Many variables are used by\nmore than one function. The domain tester will analyze a variable and\nthen, based on that analysis, run tests that involve this variable on each\nfunction with this variable as an input or an output.\n\nEquivalence class analysis. An equivalence class is a set of values for a\nvariable that you consider equivalent. Test cases are equivalent if you\nbelieve that (a) they all test the same thing; (b) if one of them catches a bug,\nthe others probably will too; and (c) if one of them doesn’t catch a bug, the\nothers probably won’t either. Once you’ve found an equivalence « class, test\nonly one or two of its members.\n\nBoundary testing. An equivalence class is a set of values. If you can map\nthem onto a number line, the boundary values are the smallest and largest\nmembers of the class. In boundary testing, you test these, and you also test\nthe boundary values of nearby classes that are just smaller than the\nsmallest member of the class you're testing and just larger than the largest\nmember of the class you're testing. For example, consider an input field\nthat accepts integer values between 10 and 50. The boundary values of\n\noe ena etree meme ee\n\ninterest are 10 (smallest), 9 (largest integer that is too small), 50 (largest),\nand 51 (smallest integer that is too large).\n\nBest representative testing. A best representative of an equivalence class is a\nvalue that is at least as likely as any other value in the class to expose an\nerror in the software. In boundary testing, the boundary cases are almost\nalways best representatives. But suppose that you cannot map an\nequivalence class onto a number line. For example, the printers that are\nHewlett-Packard PCL-5 compatible are (or should be) an equivalence class\nbecause they should all work the same way. Now suppose that for a\nspecific task, one of the printers is slightly more likely to have trouble than\nthe others. This printer would be a best representative for that class. If it\ndoesn’t fail, we have some confidence that the other printers also wouldn't.\n\nInput field test catalogs or matrices. For each type of input field, you can\ndevelop a fairly standard set of test cases and reuse it for similar fields in\nthis product and later products. We give an example of this technique later\nin the chapter. (See the How to Create a Test Matrix for an Input Field.)\n\nMap and test all the ways to edit a field. You can often change the value of a\nfield in several ways. For example, you might be able to import data into\nthe field, enter data directly into the field, have the program copya\ncalculated result into the field, have the program copy a recalculated result\ninto the field, and so on. The field has constraints (restrictions or. what\nvalues the field can take). Some constraints will be constant, while others\nwill depend on the values of other fields. For example, if J and K are\nunsigned integers, they’re constrained to the values of 0 through MaxInt.\nThese are constant constraints. They depend on the programming\nlanguage’s definition of unsigned integers. However, suppose that N is\nalso an unsigned integer, that N = J + K, and that N = 5. In this case, J=5\n— K, and J cannot possibly be bigger than 5 (the value of N). This is a\nvariable constraint, whose range of allowable values depends on the value\nof N. To check that J is kept within its allowable range (5 — Kk), you would\ntry changing its value using each way that you can enter data into J.\n\nLogic testing. Variables have relationships in the program. For example, the\nprogram might have a decision rule that says that if PERSON-AGE is\ngreater than 50 and if SMOKER is YES, then OFFER-INSURANCE must be\nNO. The decision rule expresses a logical relationship. Logic testing\nattempts to check every logical relationship in the program. Cause-effect\ngraphing is a technique for designing an extensive set of logic-based tests.\n\nState-based testing. A program moves from state to state. In a given state,\nsome inputs are valid, and others are ignored or rejected. In response to a\nvalid input, the program under test does something that it can do and does",

In state-based testing, you walk\nthe program through a large set of state transitions (state changes) and\ncheck the results carefully, every time.\n\nPath testing. A path includes all of the steps that you took or all of the .\nstatements that the program passed through in order to get to your current *\nstate. Path testing involves testing many paths through the program. You\ncannot test all the paths through a nontrivial program. Therefore, some\ntesters do subpath testing, testing many partial paths. Basis-path testing, for\nexample, involves testing most or all subpaths of a certain type (the basis\npaths), under the assumption that if you get all of these, few tests of longer\npaths would be likely to find bugs that these tests missed.\n\nStatement and branch coverage. You achieve 100 percent statement coverage\nif your tests execute every statement (or line of code) in the program. You\nachieve 100 percent statement and branch coverage if you execute every\nstatement and every branch from one statement to another. Designing your\ntests to achieve a high percentage of line and branch coverage is sometimes\ncalled “Coverage-based testing.” (And after you achieve that, you can quit\ntesting or quit designing additional tests). We call this statement-and-branch\ncoverage to differentiate it from all of the other types of testing that focus on\nsome other type of coverage. Configuration coverage is an excellent\nexample of a technique that hits the same statements many times but with\n\npotentially very different results. There are many, many other examples\n(Kaner 1995a). Testing that is focused on achieving high statement-and-\nbranch coverage numbers will characteristically miss many types of bugs,\nsuch as (but not only) bugs involving missing code, incorrect handling of\nboundary values, timing problems, problems of compatibility with:\nhardware and software configurations, delayed-fuse bugs like wild\n\n_ pointers, memory leaks or stack corruption that eventually leads to stack\noverflow, usability problems, and other failures to meet customer\nrequirements. This technique is much more valuable to identify incomplete\ntesting (what code has not yet been tested), than as a minimum standard\nfor the amount of testing needed. Indeed, it’s dangerous to allow testers to\n\nStop merely because they achieved X percent coverage (Marick 1999).\n\nConfiguration coverage. If you have to test compatibility with 100 printers,\nand you have tested with 10, you have achieved 10 percent printer\ncoverage. More generally, configuration coverage measures the percentage\nof configuration tests that you have run (and the program has passed),\ncompared to the total number of configuration tests that you plan to run.\nWhy do we call this a test technique? Ordinarily, we would just consider this a\nmeasure of how much of a certain type of testing we had achieved.\nHowever, some testers craft a special series of tests that will make high-\n\nvolume configuration testing faster and easier. In their hands, the\noptimization of the effort to achieve high coverage is the test technique.\n\nSpecification-based testing. Testing focused on verifying every factual claim\nthat is made about the product in the specification. (A factual claim is any\nstatement that can be shown to be true or false.) This often includes every\nclaim made in the manual, in marketing documents or advertisements, and\nin technical support literature sent to customers.\n\nRequirements-based testing. Testing focused on proving that the program\nsatisfies every requirement ina requirements document (or focused,\nrequirement by requirement, on proving that some of the requirements\nhave not been met.)\n\nCombination testing. Testing two or more variables in combination with\neach other. We discuss this in the Addendum on Techniques later in this\nchapter. Combination testing is important, but many testers don’t study\nenough of it. Most benefits provided by the program are based on the ©\ninteraction of many variables. If you don’t vary them jointly in your tests,\nyou'll miss errors that are triggered by difficult combinations, rather than\ndifficult individual values. .\n\nca Problems-based techniques focus on winy\n\n.

Under this view, risk analysis is done to determine what things\nto test next. Testing is prioritized in terms of the probability that some feature\nof the program will fail and the probable cost of failure, if this feature does\nfail. The greater the probability of an expensive failure, the more important it\nis to test that feature as early and as carefully as possible.\n\nThe other meaning, which is where we’re more focused, is on doing risk\nanalyses for the purpose of finding errors. When we study a feature of a\nproduct, we ask how it can fail. That question breaks down into many\nadditional questions, such as: What would a failure look like? Why should\nthis feature fail—what drivers of risk are likely to have affected this feature?\nWe describe our approach to risk-based testing in the Addendum on\nTechniques.\n\nBoth of these approaches to risk-based testing are also discussed in James\nBach on Risk-Based Testing (1999c).\n\nWhittaker and Jorgensen (1999 and 2000) provide excellent discussions and\nexamples of broad classes of errors that involve constraint violations: —\n\nInput constraints. A constraint is a limit on what the program can handle.\nFor example, if the program can only handle 32-digit numbers (or less), the\nprogrammer should provide protective routines that detect and reject an\ninput that is outside of the 32-digit constraint. If there is no such\nprotection, the program will fail when it attempts to process input data\n\nthat it cannot process. | |\n\nOutput constraints. The inputs were legal, but they led to output values that\nthe program could not handle. The program might fail when it attempts to\ndisplay, print, or save an output value. , |\n\nComputation constraints. The inputs and the outputs are fine, but in the\ncourse of calculating a value (that will lead to an output), the program\nfails. For example, multiplying two huge numbers together might yield\nsomething that is too huge for the program to cope with. |\n\nStorage (or data) constraints. Inputs, outputs, and calculations are legal, but\nthe operations run the program out of memory or yield data files that are\ntoo enormous to process. | | .\n\nWhittaker (2002) provides detailed suggestions for testing against these\nconstraints. CO a | oe\nHere are a few additional tips for the design of risk-based tests:\n\n= If you do risk-based testing, you must also do comparable nonrisk-based\ntesting to test for the risk that you didn’t know the risks well enough to\nmake the right decisions. : |\n\n= Test for timing issues. Surprisingly, many American-educated testers fail\nto consider timing issues. Some classic timing issues include race\nconditions and other unexpected orderings of events that happen in time.\n\nri When you create a test, always create a test procedure that will force the\n\nprogram to use the test data that you have entered, allowing you to\ndetermine whether it’s using that data incorrectly.\n\n(es, Activity-based techniques focus on how\n2. you test. |\n\nPPT e eta eee eee eee eE TAC eee eEE CeCe EET Eee EET Ere E eT ee Lee LCE SRE E EET AT CEE TESST LEL EESTI AUST SON OEE A DELETE TES EDI TE TE SESE U ECE ENEEECtaeatans\nPOCO eae e ere erenererenaeetaweenseneereeneDeees\nere .\n\nRegression testing. Regression testing involves reuse of the same tests, so you\ncan retest (with these) after change. There are three kinds of regression\ntesting. You do bug fix regression after reporting a bug and hearing later on\n\nthat it’s fixed. The goal is to prove that the fix is no good. The goal of old bugs\nregression is to prove that a change to the software has caused an old bug fix\nto become unfixed. Side-effect regression, also called stability regression\ninvolves retesting of substantial parts of the product. The goal is to prove\nthat the change has caused something that used to work to now be broken.\n\nScripted testing. Manual testing, typically done by a junior tester who\nfollows a step-by-step procedure written by a more senior tester.\n\nSmoke testing. This type of side-effect regression testing is done with the\ngoal of proving that a new build is not worth testing. Smoke tests are often\nautomated and standardized from one build to the next. They test things\nyou expect to work, and if they don’t, you'll suspect that the program was\nbuilt with the wrong file or that something basic is broken.\n\n_ Exploratory testing. We expect the tester to learn, throughout the project,\nabout the product, its market, its risks, and the ways in which it has failed\nprevious tests. New tests are constantly created and used. They’re more\npowerful than older tests because they're based on the tester’s\ncontinuously increasing knowledge. _ :\n\nGuerilla testing. A fast and vicious attack on the program. A form of\nexploratory testing that is usually time-boxed and done by an experienced\nexploratory tester. For example, a senior tester might spend a day testing\nan area that will otherwise be ignored. She tries out her most powerful\nattacks. If she finds significant problems, the area will be rebudgeted, and\nthe overall test plan might be affected. If she finds no significant problems,\nthe area will hereinafter be ignored or only lightly tested.\n\nScenario testing. A scenario test (as we use the term) normally involves four\nattributes. (1) The test must be realistic. It should reflect something that\ncustomers would actually do. (2) The test should be complex, involving\nseveral features, ina way that should be challenging to the program. (3) It\nshould be easy and quick to tell whether the program passed or failed the\ntest. (4) A stakeholder is likely to argue vigorously that the program should\nbe fixed if it fails this test. A test with these four attributes will be persuasive\nand will probably yield bug fixes if it fails the program. However, you\nmight have to spend days developing an excellent scenario test.\n\nScenario testing. Tests derived from use cases are also called scenario tests\n(Jacobson 1992, Collard 1999) or use case flow tests. (Many people would\nclassify these as coverage-based tests, focusing on coverage of the\nimportant use cases.) |\n\nInstallation testing. Install the software in the various ways and on the ©\n~ various types of systems that it can be installed. Check which files are\nadded or changed on disk. Does the installed software work? What\n\nhappens when you uninstall?\n\nLoad testing. The program or system under test is attacked, by being mun on\na system that is facing many demands for resources. Under ° ‘gh ° ish\nload, the system will probably fail, but the pattern of events lea A 2 oe\nfailure will point to vulnerabilities in the software or system un r ° a\nmight be exploited under more normal use of the software under test.\nAsbock (2000) is an excellent introduction to load testing.\n\nLong sequence testing. Testing is done overnight or for days or weeks. me\ngoal is to discover errors that short sequence tests will miss. Examples of the\nerrors that are often found this way are wild pointers, memory leaks, stack\noverflows, and bad interactions among more than two features. (This is\nsometimes called duration testing, reliability testing, or endurance testing.)\n\nPerformance testing. These tests are usually run to determine how quickly\nthe program runs, in order to decide whether optimization is needed. But\nthe tests can expose many other bugs. A significant change in performance\nfrom a previous release can indicate the effect of a coding error. For\nexample, if you test how long a simple function test takes to run today and\nthen run the same test on the same machine tomorrow, you'll probably\ncheck with the programmer or write a bug report if the test runs more than\nthree times faster or slower. Either case is suspicious because somethin\nfundamental about the program has been changed.? Oo\n\neo, Evaluation-based techniques focus on how\n\n32 to tell whether the test passed or failed.\n\nPOPE Renee sear eset ener maser ar essa a sen Gate OEeTOeaeAeaGEeE TSO HSE OESETEHAETO SETHE DOLOKELHA DUDE OR HSELEUTEPED ODODE RTS OSO EROS ENERO ESEOS OES OD TES DORS ROEDER EDEN DRONOREKE Eber ea enenenereaees\n\nad\n\n“\n\nThe evaluation techniques describe methods for determining whether the\nprogram passed or failed the test. They don’t specify how the testing should\n\nbe done or how the data should be collected. They tell you that, if you can\ncollect certain data, you can evaluate it.\n\nSelf-verifying data. The data files you use in testing carry information that\nlets you determine whether the output data is corrupt.\n\nComparison with saved results. Regression testing (typically, but not always\nautomated) in which pass or fail is determined by comparing the results\nyou got today with the results from last week. If the result was correct last\n\nweek, and it’s different now, the difference might reflect a new defect.\n\nSam Guckenheimer noted to us, “A performance difference might also reflect a change ina third-party\ncomponent or configuration. For example, changes in the JVM with different Sun releases of the JDK have\nhad remarkably different performance characteristics. Since this is a customer-updateable component\nperformance testing can yield surprising results even when your code hasn’t changed at all!” ,\n\nTu gy\net\noh\n\ned\n2K aves eraranecccvenarenevacarorecosssssr eres eens eee ee\n\n{\n\n. a0 be\n\noz\n>i.\n\nComparison with a specification or other authoritative document. A\nmismatch with the specification is (probably) an error }\n\nFe ee eo lroneee Consistency is an important criterion for evaluating a\nPr0s 4 \" ; esien ency may be a reason to report a bug, or it may reflect\nintentional clesign variation. We work with seven main consistencies:\n\n1. Consistent with history. Present function behavior is consistent with\npast behavior. _ | .\n\n2. Consistent with our image. Function behavior is consistent with an\nimage the organization wants to project. |\n\n3. Consistent with comparable products. Function behavior is consistent\nwith that of similar functions in comparable products.\n\n4. Consistent with claims. Function behavior is consistent with what\npeople say it’s supposed to be. | |\n\n5. Consistent with user’s expectations. Function behavior is consistent with\nwhat we think users want. |\n\n6. Consistent within product. Function behavior is consistent with behavior\nof comparable functions or functional patterns within the product.\n\n7. Consistent with purpose. Function behavior is consistent with apparent\npurpose. | |\n\nOracle-based testing. An oracle is an evaluation tool that will tell you\nwhether the program has passed or failed a test. In high-volume\nautomated testing, the oracle is probably another program that generates\nresults or checks the software under test’s results. The oracle is generally\nmore trusted than the software under test, so a concern flagged by the\noracle is worth spending time and effort to check.\n\nThe classification of a technique depends\non how you think about it.\n\nccecuaenanacsasegedgey eee eUeTbt iA A ULOg EET ET ESTE SSS\nevovecoeoreevevsvereses\n\nYou might be puzzled about why we placed particular techniques where we\ndid. If so, good for you: Your brain is turned on. Remember, all testing\ninvolves all five aspects of the Five-Fold System. We've listed techniques by\ncategory simply to give you a flavor of how different techniques emphasize\nsome ways of thinking over others. Your taste may vary. For example, one\nreader argued with us that load testing should be classified as a problem-\nfocused (or risk-focused test) rather than as an activity-focused test. Our\n\nanswer is that you can think of it either way.\n\nae eran nemeneterarassesraeaenereveserey\n\nLet’s look at this from a problem-oriented perspective:\n\nm You can think of load testing in terms of the effect of denial-of-service\nattacks. An attacker could attempt to deny service by creating too many\nconnections or users or by using too much memory (have every user issue\na memory-intensive command at the same time) or by using tasks that eat\ntoo much processing capacity. You could do different load tests for each of\n\nthese types of risk.\n\nNow consider an activity perspective:\n\n= Usea tool to track the patterns of activities of your customers. Which\ncommands do customers use most often? What tasks are customers most\nlikely to attempt? What percentage of customers do which activities?\nWhen you have a model of the usage patterns at your site, get a load test\ntool and program it with scenarios that look like each of the types of use.\nHave that tool randomly select among scenarios—in effect, create\ndifferent sessions that represent different types of users. Keep adding\nsessions and watch how performance and reliability of the system\ndegrades with increased load. Make changes to the software as\nappropriate.\n\nWhen you think in terms of the risk, you think of a weakness that the\n\nprogram might have and ask how to design a test series that would expose\n\nthat kind of weakness. When you know what type of test you want to run,\n\nthink about the way that you'll run that test. If you were testing a telephone\n\nsystem, you might need a tool, or you might be as well off with 10 friends\n\nwho make a bunch of phone calls. The criterion for the test design is that it\n\nmust have power—the ability to detect the fault that you're looking for.\n\nIn contrast, when you think in terms of activities, you're asking how to do\nload testing. What tools? What will the tools do? And so on. The expectation\nis that if you use the tools competently, model customers accurately, and do\nthe other activities associated with good load testing, then you'll probably\nfind the types of bugs that load testing is likely to reveal.\n\nEither classification is accurate, but the classification itself only helps you so\nmuch. However you classify a technique like load testing, when it comes\ntime to test, you'll still have the same five dimensions of decision:\n\nc1 Who will do the testing?\n\n= What aspects of the program are you testing?\n\n= What types of problems are you looking for?\n\n= What tasks, specifically, will you do?\n\n5 How will you tell whether a test passed or failed?\n\nTe te and os tee\n\n2.

For example, in the typical\nPrint dialog, one of the fields is Number of Copies. The range of valid values\nfor Number of Copies is typically 1 to 99 or 1 to 255 (depends on the printer),\nOn the form, you might write Print: Number of Copies on one row, then run\nsome or all of the tests on that field, and then fill in the results accordingly.\n(We like to use green and pink highlighters to fill in cells that yielded passing\nand failing test results.)\n\nThe matrix provides a structure for easy delegation. When a new feature is\nadded or a feature is changed late in the project, you can assign several of\nthese standard matrices to a tester who is relatively new to the project (but\nexperienced in testing). Her task is to check for basic functioning of the new\nfeature or continued good functioning of older features that you expect to be\nimpacted by the one that was changed.\n\nThe integer input field is just one example. You might find it valuable to\ncreate charts like this for rational numbers (of various precisions), character\n\n_ fields (of various widths), filenames, file locations, dates, and so on. If you\n\nrun into one type of input field program after program or time after time in\nthe program that you're testing, it’s worth spending the time to create a\nreusable matrix. |\n\nHow to Create a Test Matrix for\nRepeating Issues\n\nThe text matrix for an input field is just one example of a broad class of\nuseful matrices you can create. Input fields aren’t the only candidates for\nstandardization. Whenever a situation recurs frequently, across and within\nprograms, you have a basis for spending time and effort to create a testing\ncatalog. Given a catalog, you can always format it as a matrix.\n\n~ Here’s an example that doesn’t involve input variables.\n\nIn this case, the catalog lists the ways the program could be unsuccessful in\nan attempt to write a file to disk. In several situations the program would\nattempt to write a file, such as:\n\n© Saving a new file.\n\n© Overwriting a file with the same name.\n\n= Appending to a file.\n\n= Replacing a file that you’re editing, with a new version, same name.\n\n= Exporting to a new file format.\n\n| om\n\nmM\n\nmM\n\n|\ng\n\nnau ae TRETYY  Ie | fo\nPrinting to disk.\nLogging messages or errors to disk.\n\nSaving a temporary file. (Many programs do this as part of their routine,\nso you might not think of it during user interface testing. However, if the\ndisk is full, the program can still fail.)\n\nEach of these situations will have its own row in the matrix. Similarly, if the\nsoftware under test enables you to export to different formats, the test matrix\nwill have one format per row.\n\nThe columns indicate the tests that you perform. For example, try saving a\nfile to a full disk. Try saving a file to an almost full disk. Try saving a file toa\ndrive that gets disconnected, and so on.\n\nHere’s a catalog of some of the interesting test cases for unsuccessful\nattempts to save a file:\n\nci\n\nUO O @ © O 8 OQ oo gg\n\nO\n\nSave to a full local disk.\n\nSave to an almost full local disk.\n\nSave to a write-protected local disk.\n\nSave to a full disk on the local network.\n\nSave to an almost full disk on the local network.\n\nSave to a write-protected disk on the local network.\n\nSave to a full disk on a remote network.\n\nSave to an almost full disk on a remote network.\n\nSave to a write-protected disk on a remote network.\n\nsave to a file, directory, or disk that you don’t have write privileges to.\n\nSave to a damaged (I/O error) local disk, local network disk, or remote\ndisk.\n\nSave to an unformatted local disk, local network disk, or remote disk.\n\n© Remove local disk, local network disk, or remote disk from drive after\n\nopening file.\nTimeout waiting for local disk, local network disk, or remote disk to come\nback online.\n\nCreate a keyboard and mouse I/O during a save to a local disk, local\nnetwork disk, or remote disk.\n\nGenerate some other interrupt during a save to a local drive, local\nnetwork disk, or remote disk.\n\nRe et SON GENRE ONIN SORT WARERUECIIINGS\n\n= Power out (of local computer) during a save to a local drive, local network\ndisk, or remote disk.\nm= Power out (of drive or computer connected to drive) during a save toa\n~— Jocal drive, local network disk, or remote disk.\n\nTo create a catalog like this, we suggest you have two brainstorming sessions\n_ with colleagues. In the first session, try to think of anything that would be a\n_ test you would routinely run on the object (like input field) or task (like\nsaving a file) under test. Budget an hour, fill lots of flip charts, and then send\n_ your colleagues away for a day while you organize the material from the\n- brainstorms. =~ + ee So |\nTo organize the material, create a new set of flipchart pages. Write a theme\n| heading on each, like “disk capacity” and “interrupted while writing.” Under\nthe heading, copy all of the items from the flipcharts that fit into that theme.\nEventually, all items will be on one of the theme flipcharts or discarded.

Table 3.2 shows an example.\n\nEach column contains a different specification item. A spec item might refer\n\nto a function, a variable; a value (e. g.,a boundary case) of a variable, a\n\npromised benefit, an allegedly compatible device, or any other promise or\n_, Statement that can be proved true or false.\n\nEach row is a test case.\n\nEach cell shows which test case tests which items.\n\nTable 3.2 Specification Traceability Matrix\n\nSUE CRIES DE CHNECDE CREENC DE CHENG DEG\n4 GMS TES TEMS me\n\nX\nX\n\nIf a feature changes, you can see quickly which tests must be reanalyzed and\nprobably rewritten. In general, you can trace back from a given item of\ninterest to the tests that cover it.\n\nThis matrix isn’t a perfect test document. It doesn’t specify the tests; it merely\nmaps the test cases to the specification items. You can’t see from this matrix\nwhether the test is a powerful one or a weak one, or whether it does\nsomething interesting with the feature (or other spec item) or something that\nno one would care about. You also can’t see the testing that is being done of\nfeatures that haven't been specified or of adjustments you’ve made in the\ntesting to deal with specs that were incorrect. Despite these problems, charts\nlike this can be useful for helping you understand:\n\n© That one feature or item is almost never tested, while another is tested\nextremely often.\n\nm That a change to one item (such as Spec Item 6 in Table 3.2) will cause\nrevisions to a huge number of tests in the system. (This is a key issue in\ncontract-driven development, because the client is going to pay a lot of\ntesting money if they get the change they’re apparently asking for, and\nthey should be warned of that before the change is made.)\n\nTraceability matrices are useful in more cases than just specification-driven\ntesting. Any time you have a list of things you want tested (specification\nitems, features, use cases, network cards, whatever), you can run that list\nacross the top of the matrix, run the list of test cases down the rows, and then\ncheck which test cases test what. You'll almost certainly find holes in your\ntesting this way. If your tests are automated, you may be able to generate a\n\ntraceability matrix automatically.\n\nHow to Do Combination Testing Using\nthe All-Pairs Technique\n\n~ Combination testing involves testing several variables together. The first\ncritical problem of combination testing is the number of test cases. Imagine\ntesting three variables together, when each variable has 100 possible values.\nThe number of possible tests of Variable 1 with Variable 2 with Variable 3 is\n\n- 100 x 100 X 100 = 1,000,000 test cases. Reducing the number of tests is a\ncritical priority. — a SO |\n\nStart with Domain Partitioning | |\nThe first step is to reduce the number of values that will be testedin each\nvariable. The most common approach involves domain testing. Partition the\nvalues of Variable 1 into subdomains and choose best representatives of the\nsubdomains. Perhaps you can bring the number of tests of Variable 1 down\n_ to five this way. If you can do:the same for Variable 2 and Variable 3, you\n_ now only have 5 x 5 x 5 tests (125). This is still too many for practical\npurposes, but it’s a lot less than a million. Be |\n_ The best discussions in print of partitioning are in Ostrand and Balcer (1988)\n_. and Jorgensen (1995). Jorgensen provides good examples of partitioning and\nof testing several partitioned variables in combination. We present a different\napproach to combinations from his, which we have found useful. |\n\nAchieving All Singles\n\n; The simplest set of combination tests would ensure that you cover every\nvalue of interest (every one of the five that we'll test) of every variable. This is\n_ called all singles (in contrast to all pairs and all triples) because you’re making\n\nsure that you hit every single value of every variable. You can achieve this as\nfollows: | oe :\n\nae Let V1, V2, and V3 stand for the three variables.\n\n2. Let A, B,C, D, and E be the five values of interest in variable V1. In\n_ particular, suppose that V1 is the operating system; A is Windows 2000; B\nis Windows 95; C is Windows 98 original; D is Windows 98 with the first\nservice pack; and E is Windows ME. _ ;\n\n3. Let | J, K,L, and M be the five values of interest in variable V2. In\n‘Particular, suppose that V2 is the browser; | is Netscape 4.73; J is Netscape\n6; K is Explorer 5.5; L is Explorer 5.0; and M is Opera 5.12 for Windows.\n\n4. ve V, W, X, Y, and Z, be the five values of interest in variable V3. These\nrefer to five different disk drive options on the system.\n\nTo test all combinations\n\nof these variables’ values, we would have 5 X 5 X5\n= 125 tests. oe |\n\nTable 3.3 is a combination test table that achieves “complete testing,” when\n\nthe criterion of completeness is that every value of every variable must\nappear in at least one test. ne\n\nThis approach is often used in configuration testing to reduce the number of\nconfigurations under test to a manageable number.\n\nA serious problem with the approach is that it misses predictably important\nconfigurations. For example, a lot of people might be using Explorer 5.5 with\nWindows ME, but that test isn’t listed here. Instead, the table shows Opera\n5.12 with Windows ME. - :\n\nA common solution to this problem is to specify additional test cases that\ninclude key pairs of variables (such as Explorer 5.5 with Windows ME) or\nmore key combinations of more than two variables (such as Explorer 5.5,\nWindows ME, HP 4050N printer, 256M RAM,-and a 21-inch color monitor\nbeing driven at 1600 x 1200 resolution.) Marketing or technical support staff\nmight specify these, naming perhaps 10.or 20 additional key configurations,\nfor a total of 15 or 25 tests.\n\nAchieving All Pairs\n\nIn the all pairs approach (Cohen et al., 1996 and 1997), the set of test cases\nincludes all of the pairs of values of every variable. So, E (Windows ME) isn’t\njust paired with M (Opera). It’s also paired with I, J, K, and L. Similarly, E is\npaired with every value of V3. |\n\nTable 3.3 All Singles—All Values are Represented at Least Once\n\nTest Case 1 A (Win 2K) - | - 1 (Netscape 4.73) Ov (Disk option 1) —\n“Test Case3 C(Win98) «KK (IE5.5) ———_—*X (Disk option 3)\nTest Case 4D (Win 98 SPI) L (IE 5.0) ' YY (Disk option 4) —\n\nTest Case 5 (WinME) -M(Opera5.12) 2 (Disk option®)\n\n25 Instead of\n, ented at Least Once (\n\nirs~All Pairs of Values are Repres\n\nTable 3.4 All Pairs—Al\n\n125 Tests)\n\nt Test Case eros =\n\n‘Table 3.4 illustrates a set of combinations that Will meet the all-pairs criterion.\n\ne is paired with every value of every other\n\nase. This is a much more thorough standard than\nall singles, but it stil] reduces the number of test cases from 125 (all\ncombinations) to 25, a big savings.\n\nTo show how to create an all\n\n“pairs test set, we'll work through\nexample, step by step,\n\na simpler",

In the second column, list all the values of the variable, skip the line, list\nthe values, and so forth. For example, if Variable 2’s possible values are X\nand Y, the table looks like Table 3.5 so far.\n\n5. Add the third column (the third variable).\n\nEach section of the third column (think of the two AA rows as defining a\nsection, BB as defining another, and so on) will have to contain every\nvalue of Variable 3.

See Table 3.6.\nNow that we’ve solved the three-column exercise, try adding more variables.\n\nEach of them will have two values.\n\nTo add a variable with more than two values, you have to start over, because\nthe order of variables in the table must be from the one with the largest\nnumber of values to the next largest number and on down so that the last\ncolumn has the variable with the fewest values.

Your bug report should\nmake it clear to the reader why he should want to fix this bug. For\nexample, you might explain how the bug interferes with normal use of the\nproduct, what data it corrupts, or how often people will run into it. You\nmight point to a magazine review or other published complaint that\nsavaged a competitor for a bug similar to this one. You might quote\ntechnical support statistics to show that bugs like this one in other\nproducts have cost a lot of money. You might show that the program\npassed this test in a previous release. (This is a key issue in some\ncompanies.) Or you might make sure that the report is drawn to the\nattention of someone whose pet feature is interfered with by this bug. In\nmany cases (see the following), you can take a relatively minor-looking ©\nbug and discover more severe consequences by doing follow-up testing,\nrather than reporting the first version of the bug that you see.\n\nAnticipate objections to the sale and counter them. Some bugs are\ndismissed as too minor, not reproducible, impossible to understand, /\n\nZS\n\n“lla\n\nunlikely to ever happen in the real world, as a problem that occurs only on\na very specific equipment configuration that no one will] have, too risky to\nfix, or not likely to bother the actual users of the product.

Other objections vary from bug to bug. You might\nanticipate one and include some relevant information in your bug report,\nor you might wait, see the initial reactions to the report, and add the\ninformation as the bug goes through review. We’re not Saying that you\nshould argue for the bug in the report. Rarely or never say, “I know you’re\nthinking of not fixing this, but if you think it’s unimportant for this reason,\nthen you should know about that.” Instead, we’re suggesting that if you\nthink of a key objection, you might include some relevant facts, like “A\nsimilar bug was shipped in Release 2 of this product.

Much bug fixing is done on their time—after hours or on\nweekends.

The first errors you find will\noften be at the extremes. The idea behind testing at the extremes is that if the\nprogram can survive these, it can probably survive less extreme results. Thus,\nyou can learn a lot from a few extreme tests. For example, to test an input\n\n‘It will not always be possible to collect the right set of people into the test group, in time for the project that\nneeds them.

If you feel that the research is taking too long to\nrepay the investment, stop and look for new bugs. If the programmers in\nyour company always take extreme-value bugs seriously, you can simply\n\nreport them without further work.\n\n~ Minor bugs are worth reporting and fixing.\n\nMinor errors confuse customers and reduce customer confidence in the rest\nof the product. Bugs considered minor might include spelling mistakes, —\nminor screen formatting problems, mouse droppings (small blotches left on\nthe screen behind the mouse pointer), minor calculation errors, graphs\ndrawn not quite to scale, errors in the online help, menu choices that are —\ninappropriately grayed out (or not grayed out when they should be),\nshortcut keys that don’t work, incorrect error messages, mishandling of\nextreme values, mishandling of timeouts, and anything else that a |\nprogrammer says will take more effort to fix than it’s worth.\n\n| Several years ago, one of us, Kaner, in collaboration with David Pels\nexamined the effect of minor bugs on technical support costs. Kaner was a\nsoftware development manager; Pels managed technical support. Working\nwitha strong-selling mass-market product, Kaner and Pels reviewed every\nletter and email ever received from customers, magazine reviews, customer\nca records, pac’ the entries in the bug-tracking system. They classed an\nasa ; eap fix” if it would cost fewer than four hours (not counting\n\ntesting time) to fix it. The fix might be a code change, a replacement of a\ndriver or data file on the disk, a change to the user manual or to the text on\nthe product's box. As long as it required less than four hours and would\n\nrevent subsequent customer complaints on that issue, it counted as a\ncheap fix. Under this criterion, they concluded that cheap fixes (of minor\nbugs) could have prevented over half of the technical support calls for this\nproduct. (They discuss this work briefly in Kaner and Pels 1997 .) Over the\nnext year, Kaner’s group fixed many of these problems, and technical\nsupport cost per new customer dropped by half. There isn’t a perfect cause-\nand-effect relationship here because Kaner’s group also fixed some major\nbugs and added a few new features (and bugs), but it seemed clear to them\n(Kaner and Pels) that the general cleanup had a major impact on customer\nsatisfaction. The market share of the product also increased substantially\nover the year. | |\n\nAny product can get by with a few minor defects. But as the number\nincreases, customer confidence declines. More disturbing is the corrupting\neffect of tolerating these bugs. At the point that you stop even reporting |\nminor bugs (some companies pressure their staff to report only “worthwhile”\nerrors), you'll find yourself and your company tolerating more and more\nserious ones. Down that road (unless you’re in a monopoly position in your\nmarket), lies product failure. This progressive toleration of larger errors was _\nan important factor in the Challenger disaster, as Richard Feynman vividly\nshows in his book What Do You Care What Other People Think (Feynman 89).\n\n».

Priority indicates\n\nwhen your company wants it fixed. Severity doesn’t change unless you learn\nmore about hidden consequences. Priorities change as a project progresses.\nGenerally, more severe problems are higher priority to fix, and minor and\ncosmetic problems are low priority. However, they’re not the same. Severe —\nproblems may not be worth fixing—for example, suppose that you find a bug\nthat will corrupt any new record that is created before December 1999. This\nwould have been a high-priority bug a couple of years ago (when December\n1999 was still a date in the future), it’s still serious, but many companies\nwould no longer fix it. | |\n\nen the other hand, a start-up splash screen with your company logo\nackwards and the name misspelled is purely a cosmetic problem.

Or,\ntry entering the numbers more quickly or change the speed of your activity\nin some other way. And of course, you can try a wide range of other\nexploratory testing techniques. It’s sometimes useful to run many entirely\nunrelated subsequent tests, simply by continuing to use the program\nwithout restarting or resetting it.\n\nVary the options and settings of the program (change the conditions by\nchanging something about the program.under test). Typical changes are to\nuse a different database, to change the values of persistent variables, to\nchange how the program uses memory, or to change anything else the\nprogram allows you to change (any other option or preference or setting).\nIn the scrolling example, maybe you would change the size of the program\nwindow, the precision of the digits being displayed, or the background\nactivity setting for the spell checker. | |\n\nVary the software and hardware environment (change the conditions by\nchanging the software that runs with this program or the hardware you're\ntesting it on). This isn’t configuration testing. You aren't checking out the\nbug on the standard configurations. Instead, you are asking what ways\nyou could change the configuration that might make this failure more\nimpressive. For example, if you think that timing might be a factor, use a\ndifferent speed processor or video display or communications connection.\nIf you think memory might be relevant, work ona machine that has less\n(or more) memory or change your virtual memory settings. .\n\nYou can do follow-up testing forever. How much should you do? Do at least\na few minutes of follow-up testing for every failure that you believe reflects a\ncoding error (something unintended by the programmer).\n\nFor some failures, you’ll do more testing, maybe even a day of testing. Trust\nyour judgment. If you think a few more tests might yield valuable new\ninformation, try them. If you think you know as much about the bug now as\n\nyou're going to know after more testing, stop this type of testing and report\nwhat you know. Trust your judgment. |\n\nAlways report nonreproducible errors;\nthey may be time bombs.\n\nNonreproducible errors can be the most expensive bugs your company might\nrelease.

It is\nnot unreasonable to believe that programmers can fix 20 percent of the\n“nonreproducible” bugs that are reported to them.\n\nEven if you are in a company whose programmers ignore nonzeproducible\nbugs as a matter of policy, we suggest that you still report them. Don t report\na bug that you haven’t made a competent effort to reproduce. But if you still\ncan’t reproduce the bug, it’s still worth reporting. Scan the database\nperiodically looking for patterns in the nonreproducible bugs. The\n\nsame problem might show up several times and (if you always report\nnonreproducible errors) be reported several times. Each of these reports will\nbe slightly different. Together, they might give you strong hints about the\nunderlying conditions. |\n\nWhen you report a nonreproducible bug, make it clear that you cannot\nreplicate the bug. Some tracking systems have a field for this (Can you\nreproduce this: yes /no/intermittent/unknown). Some companies rely\ninstead on conventions, such as flagging the bug as NR (not reproducible) in\nthe summary line or on the first line of the description.\n\nUsing PrintScreen, a screen recorder like Spector, or even video recording can\nhelp you prove the existence of UFOs (Unidentified Funny Objects) that\nsome programmers would otherwise say could never have appeared.\n\nCORP ens asseaesrareroresrnrarerarsetaesenearansoaeenenese\nwerent eres eeeeeteneeraeeeaeereuenenseneeeeeneueaseeaeeeausenessaaeannspeceneasacanaesesesseucagueanenssececutececcsesestacoennese\n\nFailures occur under specific conditions.

In some companies, the full\nChange Control Board reviews the bug to decide what to do with it. In_\nothers, the bug goes to the Change Control Board only after the programmer\nor project manager decides not to fix the bug. That's a lot of readers. Add up\neveryone’s time, and you might discover that it takes your company between\ntwo and eight person-hours to review and reject a minor bug. Late in the\nproject, if you flood the company with minor bug reports, you might single-\nhandedly kill the productivity of the programming and project management\nteams. You may elicit a surprising amount of resentment or anger by\nreporting very minor problems or by writing unclear (unnecessarily time-\nconsuming) reports later in the project.\n\nWhen you report a minor bug, take special care to make your report clear,\nand well analyzed (see the points on follow-up testing later in this chapter). If\nyou're about to report a collection of minor bugs late in the schedule, talk\nwith your test manager about group policy. Perhaps you should report the\nbugs into a secondary database that will be formally reviewed as input to the\nnext release but that will be ignored in this release. This preserves your work\nbut gets it out of the way. |\n\nWhen you’re about to report an irreproducible bug, especially when you do\nthis late in the schedule, take extra care to try to reproduce the bug. If you do\nsolid follow-up testing and you still can’t recreate the bug, say explicitly that\nthe bug is nonreproducible and describe the troubleshooting that you did\nand the symptoms that you encountered. |\n\nee, Give special handling to bugs related to\n. 7 the tools or environment. |\n\nSeer esreavacaraverererencassvaes\n\nCP eR teen eR Tee Cree ete eN TET ETE eee eT ese AOA T ATA D COTA AOD OR OA HOR UO ODO aOR TESA SNe H nee Eee aE eabanececeneaesenentavenacesoacepecapocureneneneanaesseneenerecat\n\nIf the program fails because of a known weakness in the operating system or\nin another application or system that your program communicates with, and\nthe failure is totally outside of the programmers’ control, you might\nreasonably decide to not report it. On the other hand, you might have\ndiscovered a fault easily fixed with appropriate error handling code.\n\nHowever, the program might fail because it interacts badly with a known\n\n_ weakness in the operating system (or in some other product or system). For\nexample, perhaps the programmer can revise the program so that it doesn't\nmake the critical system call and, therefore, won't cause the system crash.\nThis is partially an O/S bug, but because the failure can be prevented at\nthe application level, it is also an application bug. If you think this is the\nsituation, report it this way. As always, report the steps to reproduce the\nproblem first. But then add a note saying that you know this appears to\n\n- *\n\ninvolve an interaction between the application and the O/S, but you’re\nhoping the app lication can work around the O/S-level bug. Before reporting a\nlot of bugs this way, consider talking with someone you trust who knows a\nlot about the underlying system.\n\nAlso consider using appropriate tools to make snapshots of the configuration\non which the failure appears. For example, Rational distributes a free\n\ninstall analyzer to record the details of a Windows installation and compare\nto a reference (VeriTest-Rational Install Analyzer, available at www.rational\ncom/ products /testfoundation). A similar tool is InCtrl5, available at\n\n~ gdnet.com.\n\nSimilarly, programmers often blame failures on third-party code that is\nintegrated into the application. Report these bugs in every case, because\nthey’re failures caused by errors in the package of code your company is\ngiving to customers. Advocate for the repair of these bugs if you reasonably\nbelieve the programmers could work around the problems in the third-party\n\ncode they’re using.\n\nAsk before reporting bugs against\n\nPPT PT errrrrrererrrrrererrrrrrrrrirtrrrrrertrirititirrcrtiinitiii Te eee\n\nbeara ee eran ene recessed anes as ean saree ena reaea\n\nSometimes a programmer will show you a private version and ask for private\ntesting. If your company allows this, respect the implicit rules. Bugs\ndiscovered when you review early code probably aren’t reported in the bug-\ntracking system. Instead, they’re reported in conversation or in notes or\nemails to the programmer. If you make public the bugs that a programmer\nshows you in an early, private release of the code, you will break the\nprogrammer’s trust. The most likely result will be that you won't get to see\n\nthese early releases again.\n\nAt some point, the program will become public within the company, ready\nfor regular testing. Use the notes that you took during your private preview\nof the program. Any bugs you found before, which haven't yet been fixed,\nshould go into the tracking system.\n\nWe must note abuses of this arrangement. We have encountered\nprogramming groups who tried to hide their schedule problems by hiding\ntheir bugs. They wanted to call every release of the software to Testing a\nprototype or a private release until the final version. They didn’t want any\nbug reports entered into the tracking system (where management might find\nthem) until that final version.\n\nIf you run into this situation, work with your manager. If you're the test\nmanager, you may have to consult the project manager's manager or other\n\nPees.\n\nkey stakeholders. The underlying question is whether your company\nconsiders the prerelease bug-tracking data to be a tool poman or the\nprogramming group or a corporate resource that key stakeho ers are .\nentitled to see. Try to be cooperative and helpful. And never participate in\n\nconduct that your company will see as a cover-up.\n\nDuplicate bug reports are a self-correcting\nproblem. a\n\ndearer erence eee r sparen eres eeas sree eran saeseseseeee AP One ae meee eh eve eR ea E OER EDOM OHO DOO NOL OEE rEnenens\naone . »\n> . .\n\nPT eTTTrTTeeTeTit ir irictit ici tiie ies\n\nSOM a rere ro raeeinavsvarerseoceeseversrertesees\nFOCO sere enerarareceerereneveneveunsaeeesene\nPeer erarsaeeoenaverareraverses\n\nOf course, it is usually better to add data to an existing, open bug report than\nto write a new report of what you believe is the same bug. If you know that\nyou're reporting a bug that is similar to another one, cross-reference them.\n\nIn some companies, especially companies that pay too much attention to bug\nstatistics and bug curves, project managers and programmers get upset about\nduplicate bug reports or argue to management that the bug counts are\ninflated by the duplicates. In these companies, do a cursory search for a\nprevious report of the same bug. However,\n\n= Don’t let your search time get out of hand. If the database is big enough,\nyou can spend a lot of unproductive time searching for duplicates.\nManage your time.\n\nca Every well-written report of the same bug carries new information that\ncan help make the bug easier to fix.\n\nc1 Whether two reports represent duplicates can be a matter of opinion. You\nmay have two failures caused by the same fault. Or, multiple faults may\nbe involved in a failure. Until the matter is settled and the bug fixed,\nretain all the information you've collected (Pettichord 2000a).\n\nThe project manager who protests that duplicates are driving up the bug\nnumbers can easily fix this problem by getting these bugs fixed.\n\nTOV eter ever o re emer ever aueeDeee ner eneHeTeEn Eden reer eves esas seeenenererereer\n\nDon’t merge different bugs onto the same report in an effort to appease a\nproject manager or programmer who constantly complains about duplicates.\nIf you write a report that has multiple bugs on it, some of them will probably\nnever be fixed.

Don’t make it\neasy to reject your reports.\n\nDeciding on the solution that fits the bug is the product designer’s role. For\nexample, suppose you discover an error message that disappears as soon as\nthe user moves the mouse, rendering it difficult to read. You may be tempted\nto write a bug report that says “the error message should appear in a dialog\nbox that is always on top until explicitly dismissed.” If you do that, don’t be\nsurprised if the designer writes back a curt note telling you to mind your\nown business. The fact is, there are several solutions to the error message\nproblem. The designer gets to pick the one that he thinks fits best.\n\nAnother problem with solution-oriented bug reporting is that many testers\nget so caught up in their proposed solution that they don’t provide clean,\naccurate information about the failure itself. If the tester misunderstands the\nunderlying cause of the failure, the proposed solution is worthless at best. It\nis often worse than worthless because the tester unintentionally omits key\ninformation or writes a report that draws the programmer’s attention to the\nwrong details. Reports like these sometimes bring a lot of laughs to the\n\nprogramming group. You might not want to be the person at whose ignorant\nsuggestions they’re laughing. |\n\njie\n\nye\n\nerence\nPTPETETESTITITUPTTELETETET TITTLE ee\n\nA better way to report the disappearing message problem might be “an erro\nmessage appeared, but I was not able to read it, because it dice eared as ‘\nsoon as I moved the mouse.” If you have a good relationship with the\ndesigner, you might also add, “If it was a modal dialog, that might solve the\nproblem.” Note that this suggestion does not sound like an imperative.\n\nIf it’s common knowledge on the project that some part of the program is\nsupposed to work in one and only one way, then the difference between a\nproblem and the lack of a solution may be the same thing.

This is particularly apparent in the cases of custom, contract software\nand of in-house development. The customer is actually paying for your time.\nSome bugs are less expensive to deal with than the cost of their repair. But\neven remote customers have value tradeoffs. Imagine working on an update\nrelease that will fix a critical error that erases some customers’ data. The\nprogram with the bug is in use, in the field. Now imagine delaying that\nupdate release so that a spelling mistake can be fixed. The answer in the case\nof this update release seems obvious (don’t fix the spelling mistake). For less\nobvious decisions, the project team is responsible for imagining and\nevaluating the tradeoffs, in order to reach the right balance of time, cost,\nfeature availability, and reliability.\n\nIf you cannot build a case that a bug is important or find a stakeholder who\ncares enough to actively support your appeal of that particular deferral, we\nsuggest that you leave that bug alone and challenge something else.\n\nDeferred means that the bug you reported is real, but it’s not going to be fixed\nin this release. Therefore, bugs that were closed as deferred in this release are\nopen issues at the start of the next release. Many groups set up their bug-\ntracking systems to automatically reopen the old deferred bugs or to transfer\nthem (as open bugs) into the new file for the next version product. They often\nalso reopen bugs that were rejected as “works as designed,” if the relevant\ndesign decisions are under review in the new release.\n\nProducts that pass through many releases pick up a collection of annoying\nbug reports that will never result in code changes or documentation\nimprovements. Some groups do a review with project managers and\npermanently close some bugs as INWTSTA (“I never want to see this again”).\n\n4- “4y\n\n(li RMB BES huey 1 OT\nIt’s best to do this review at the start of the\nare at their minimum and the project mana\nreasonable.\n\nproject, when schedule pressures\ner 1s at her calmest and most\n\ngeo, Testing inertia should never be the cause\n“gy of bug deterral.\nYou know you have a fatally flawed process when the test manager asks the\nprogrammers not to fix a bug (coding error or design error) on the grounds\nthat the change involved would affect too many checklists, scripts, or other\ntesting artifacts and, therefore, would take too long to manage.\n\n¥\nsvesaenenaneveveraseses eee esseerar essen sees ss ares ETT Es en sree eas ET eET TES avEs eee eneeesetareteeneeessnsvenas\n\nEIDE SIN INISELSISISSSIN GG ERAIDOREDOR ENGL RT OTE SATEEN UO AS SCOT OREO REE eS aDeraeeeerecestscabavevecneecees\n\nIf a bug of yours is deferred or rejected (the program works as designed),\ndecide whether or not to appeal the decision.

So, why not make software test software? The\nreasoning goes, if one computer can do the work of three million mathematicians\nusing sticks and sand, then surely one computer is worth an army of human\ntesters. Indeed, test automation is an exciting idea that holds great promise. But\nbeware. Automating some of your testing might or might not be helpful.\nAutomation can save time, speed development, extend your reach, and make\nyour testing more effective.

That’s science fiction.\n\nYour investment in test automation is valuable to the extent that it helps you\nachieve your mission. The role of testing is to gain information. What\ninformation is your automation providing?\n\nAutomation efforts have been spectacularly successful for some groups but\nhave left others unhappy and frustrated. Some of the failing groups have\ndeluded themselves and their management into thinking that the work they\nput into automation yielded something that was helpful.\n\nUse automation when it advances the mission of testing. Evaluate your success at\nautomation in terms of the extent to which it has helped you achieve your mission.\n\nReviewers of early drafts of this chapter have separately urged us to\nemphasize some contradictory points:\n\nur tests first, before deciding which to automate.

Much of the powey\nof automated testing comes from using a computer to do things a person\ncannot do. Look for opportunities, such as being able to repeat the same\ntests over thousands of different data files. This prevents you from falling\ninto the trap of only automating tests from the existing (manual) test plang\nand missing the big opportunities for test automation. When designing\nmanual tests, you aren’t likely to consider tests that apply repetitive\noperations over thousands of files; it would simply be too much work.\n\nThese conflicting messages derive from two important lessons:\n\nc Automating without good test design may result in a lot of activity, but\n\nlittle value. |\n= Designing tests without a good understanding of automation possibilities\nmay overlook some of the most valuable opportunities for automation.\n\nWe think that to reliably succeed, you must have good test designers and\ngood automators contributing to the selection and design of your automated\ntests.

Some of the goals of their efforts are to:\n\noO Quickly detect destabilizing changes in new builds.\n\nca Expose regression bugs as quickly as possible.\n\n= Report problems quickly, because this makes fixing easier.\n\nQuick fixes keep code stable. Keeping code stable saves time (multiple\npeople don’t waste time on the same bug) and facilitates refactoring and\nother efforts to improve code structure and straighten out spaghetti code. If\n\nthe code base is largely stable, and a strong suite of automated tests is in\nplace, the programmers can attempt bigger changes at lower risk. The project\n\n—.

The phrase “smoke test” comes from hardware\ntesting. You plug in a new board and turn on the power. If you see smoke\ncoming from the board, turn off the power. You don’t have to do any more\ntesting. Smoke tests (a.k.a. build verification tests) broadly cover product\nfeatures in a limited time—typically over lunch or overnight. If key\nfeatures don’t work or if key bugs haven't yet been fixed, your team won't’\nwaste further time installing or testing the build. Getting it fixed becomes\nthe programmers’ top priority. 7 .\n\nAutomated unit tests. These tests also streamline a development process,\nprevent backtracking, and maintain development momentum. These are\n\nlarger sets of tests that focus on testing the low-level functions and classes\nof your product. |\n\nThe greatest value of automated smoke and unit tests is that they can be run\nat any time and by any one. Run them automatically as part of the build\nprocess. Their availability helps individual programmers create minibuilds\nthat incorporate just one or a few of their changes. If one of those builds is\nbroken, the programmer knows what to investigate. If the minibuilds are OK,\nthe broader build that comes to you, which collects everyone’s changes, is\n\nmore likely to work. This is an invaluable benefit that your project manager\nis sure to appreciate. | | |\n\nThese kinds of automated tests take time, effort, skill, and money to create.\nThe unit tests will probably be created by the programmers, although you\nmight encourage and speed that effort by writing the code with them as half\nofa programming pair.

By collecting these measurements and reviewing them\nas a time series, you can detect performance degradations. Use the same\napproach to benchmark uses of resources, such as memory or storage.\n\nConfiguration testing.

Some problems occur only in specific timing situations. The\ncoincidental timing of two threads or processes contending for the same\nresource results in an error known as a race condition. These are often hard\nto find and hard to reproduce. Automation can be a big help because you\ncan repeat tests with many slightly different timing characteristics.\n\nCombination errors. Some errors involve the interaction of several features. |\nUse automation to test huge numbers of complex tests, each of which uses\nseveral features in varying ways. |\n\nThese approaches focus on using automation to create new tests or to repeat\nproduct usage in ways designed to uncover new bugs.

We'd like to offer some\nwarnings.\n\nTests may not do what you thought. How do you know that the tests are\ndoing what they’re supposed to? Automators sometimes code different test\nprocedures from the ones they specified. Long ago, they may have had»\ngood reasons for this, or they may have been confused. How would you\nknow? How easy is it to review the tests and read the code?\n\nTests may no longer be interesting. Reviewer Douglas Hoffman reports, “I\nrecently discovered an automated memory test in use at a computer\nmanufacturer which they called a ‘lonely bit test.’ It was a test used to find\ncertain wiring errors in pre-1970s core memory. The biggest core memories\nwere 16 Kb, and the tests took minutes to run. They now can take hours to\nrun on large memory configurations. The error it looks for isn’t possible in\ncurrent memory systems. Another automated test I recently reviewed was\ndesigned to test a state machine of an embedded processor system. ] saw\nthat the documentation on the test was written in 1986, seven product\ngenerations earlier. And, no, no one had thought to update the tests when\nthe state machines were changed each generation.”\n\nCoverage may be poor. People often focus on the number of tests in a test\nsuite. It’s easy to inflate the size of a test suite by adding lots of minor\nvariations of the same test. Check the actual coverage of the test suite. You\nmay be surprised at what isn’t tested.\n\nFalse alarms may be common. With time, careless automation programming\nand deferred maintenance can lead to lots of tests that fail because of\nautomation bugs. Of course, you won’t know for sure which failures are\nproduct bugs and which are automation bugs, so you'll have to investigate\n\nGheiay Se AGwinetiy imetigg | 103 |\n\nthem all. Many of these are broken tests—tests that haven’t worked in ages\nbut that no one has had time to repair. Remove broken tests from your test\nsuites. What good are they? They are dead. Accept this and bury them or\nrepair them, now. But, don’t leave their stinking corpses in your active test\nsuites.\n\nTest results may be false. Some tests don’t check any results. They pass\nunless the product crashes. Others have bugs that can cause parts of tests\nto be skipped or will prevent detected failures from being reported. Other\ntests have invalid “golden” output files: when the tests failed, the golden\noutput file was updated instead of reporting the bug. We’re not making\nthis up. These kinds of problems, in our experience, can be expected with\nrelatively complex test suites. To avoid them, automators must keep things\nsimple or use defensive programming techniques. These kinds of problems\nare bad enough, but we have also seen and heard about many cases in\nwhich tests were simply hard-coded to pass. They just say “result=pass.”\nThe automator couldn’t have even thought these might work. We have\nspeculated as to why this happens but don’t have any convincing\nexplanations.? All we can say is that it has happened in lots of different\nplaces.

These are\nsteps in the test where you press a hot key so that screen information is saveg\nwith the script. During replay, the script compares the current screen (or\nsome programmatic attributes associated with the current screen) to the\nsaved information. If they’re different, the test fails.\n\nThe key problem is that the scripts are too tightly tied to the minor details of\nthe user interface and the system configuration. In practice, tests are often as\nlikely to fail due to intended product design changes as from unintended\nproduct regression bugs. Testers find that they spend more time analyzing\ntest failures and re-recording tests than they previously spent executing tests\n\nmanually.\n\nSuppose you have 100 test scripts that include creating an account. Suppose\nthe product changes. Now it walks you through an extra dialog in the\naccount creation workflow. All these tests will fail. You'll have to re-record\nthem.

You're frustrated that the tool vendor hasn’t\nreleased the required tool update yet. The vendor rushes it through\ntesting to get it to you when you need it.\n\n© Surprise! The rush job results in lots of bugs.\n\nThis cycle will perpetuate as long as testability has to be reverse engineered\ninto component technology, rather than being designed in from the start.\nWe’re hopeful and hear promises of improvement, but it’s hard to say when\nthis might start to happen. It’s an industry-wide problem.\n\nTest tools sometimes suffer from bugs in other components. One of us,\nPettichord, worked with an execution tool that was executing unreliably.\nMouse events sometimes weren't being generated. Eventually we tracked the\nproblem to a bug in an operating system driver. The unreliability was\nreproducible without the tool. Why didn’t manual testers find it? Because\nthey didn’t notice that an occasional mouse movement or click didn’t register.\nIf they noticed it at all, they probably blamed themselves or the mouse\nhardware. We reported the fault to the O/S vendor, who seemed\nunconcerned. The severe impact on testability was apparently of little\nimportance. We did eventually work around the problem by using different\nmouse drivers.3\n\nOther tools may impact the product you're testing so much as to make it\nunusable. Coverage and memory monitors must instrument the software and\n\ntake up significant space in memory. Such tools may slow down your\nproduct to the point where you can no longer test it.\n\nBecause test tools have such a bad reputation, your programmers are likely to\nrequire that you replicate every bug found with automation outside the test\n\nee\n3Bob Johnson reports a similar problem using different technology: “The mouse driver really played no part\napplication.

If you’re automating the GUI, plan for this. |\n\nTelling programmers they should freeze the user interface doesn’t work.\nEarly versions of user interfaces often need revision. Don't put yourself in the\nposition of recommending against improvement. The GUI will change\n\nanyway. | 7\nAbstract the interface in your test automation design. When the user interface\nchanges, you'll update the abstraction layer, rather than every test that\n\naccesses the changed interface.\n\nHere are some techniques for providing abstraction from the product GUI:\n\nWindow maps. GUI test tools support various techniques for identifying\nwindow controls, such as internal names, various properties, adjacent\nlabels, and ordinal position. Rather than embedding the identification\ntechnique in every reference to a control, use window maps to associate a\nname to the identification technique for a control. If a user interface change\nforces you to change the technique particulars, you need only update the\nwindow map. Some test tools include support for creating and using\nwindow maps, which are also called GUI maps or window declarations. If\nyour tool doesn’t include built-in support, you can usually create one\nwithout too much trouble. Window maps provide support for minor GUI\nchanges, such as renaming labels or relocating controls onscreen. They also\ncan be used to provide support for reusing tests with user interfaces that\nhave been translated into other languages.\n\nData-driven test automation. (Lesson 127: Data-driven test automation makes it\neasy to run lots of test variants.) This technique provides some abstraction in\nthat you should be able to change a test procedure and still be able to use\nthe test data you'd created for it.\n\nTask libraries. (Lesson 126: Don’t build test libraries simply to avoid repeating\ncode.) Analyze the use cases into constituent tasks. Each task should be\nconceptually distinct. Pay particular attention to the start and end states of\nthe task. Creating functions for these tasks can be used in your test scripts.\nIf the user interface for a task changes, you should have to update the task\nonly, not the tests that use it.

Some GUI test tools aren’t compatible with particular\ndevelopment environments or support them poorly. Subtle factors can cause\ntrouble. It’s difficult to predict in advance what will work or won’t work. It\nreally is a matter of trial and error. So, where do you start?\n\nFind out what tools your team already knows. Or whether they already\nknow the language used by one of the tools. The cost of training and learning\nhow to use the tool (whether in formal classes, self-study, or trial and error)\nare often quite significant. Familiarity can be a deciding factor in your\nsuccess with a tool, assuming, of course, that it actually works out.\n\nAnother important factor is the vendor’s ability to support the tool. Even if\nthe tool works well with your product today, what is going to happen when\nyou have to test it on a new platform next year? When you buy a tool, you’re\ninvesting the vendor’s ability to maintain the tool and keep it current with\nnew technologies. Check their online support forums and talk to other users\n\nabout the vendor’s history.\n\nYou'll need some time to test the compatibility of the tool with your product\nand check the vendor’s service record. Get the tool on a trial basis (30-90\ndays), or at least get a 30-day money back guarantee. During this time, you'll\nprobably run into some problems. Test their support to see whether you get\ntimely and informed responses. You should also ask to bundle training with\nthe tool purchase. This may give you a better price. We've also found that\nimportant tips for using some tools are only available in their training. These\n\ntips are not in the tool manuals.\nWe do have strong opinions about what kinds of features are helpful in a\n\ntool, but for most teams, the preceding considerations winnow the options\ndown to a single choice.

You design regression tests to detect problems i in features\nyou've already tested—problems due to programmers’ mistakes when fixing\n\nbugs or adding new features.\nRegression tests decay for several reasons, such as the following:\n\nChange of the user interface or output formats. These changes are the major\ncause of decay. Because of them, a large set of tests that used to pass will fail\neven though nothing obvious has been done to affect the features that the\ntests are aimed at. The changes may be so minor that manual regression\ntesters would barely take notice. Automated tests, however, are sensitive\nand brittle, unable to differentiate between improvements and bugs.\n\nDesigned-in assumptions about the test environment. Test suites may break\nwhen moved to different machines or when necessary resources are\nrelocated.\n\nErrors in maintenance. Automators repairing tests make mistakes,\nintroducing bugs into the test suites. Regression test suites thus develop\nregression bugs themselves. |\n\nChanging operators. ‘Test suites may require re special skills and knowledge to\noperate and maintain. When a test automator is reassigned, valuable\nknowledge can walk away. For instance, Sheila disables the disk I/O tests\ntemporarily, due to a particular bug in the product, then leaves to take that\nprogramming job in Topeka. Sheila’s replacement assumes that the tests\nare entirely obsolete and moves them to an archive, never to be seen again.\n\nTesters invest in regression automation with the expectation that the\ninvestment will pay off in due time. Sadly, they often find that the tests stop\nworking sooner than expected. The tests are out of sync with the product.\nThey demand repair. They’re no longer helping find bugs. Testers reasonably\nrespond by updating the tests. But this can be harder than expected. Many\nautomators have found themselves spending too much time e diagnosing test\nfailures and repairing decayed tests.\n\nExercise prudence when selecting tests to automate, because anything you\nautomate, you'll have to maintain or abandon. Uncontrolled maintenance\ncosts are probably the most common problem that.automated regression test\nefforts face.\n\nMaintenance costs alone should convince you to mistrust the tales that\nautomation will turn your job into a vacation.\n\nSEDI Se Autaiertig Testing | 109 |\n\n5 Test automation is a software\n. development process,\n\nTPO OeeEH See eamenen eee ee moneeanenensusanenaneren .

Many testers don’t realize that when they automate tests\nthey’re actually developing software.\n\nWeinberg (1992) presents a scale for assessing organizational development.\nLike similar scales, level one is the chaotic organization; level two is\nrepeating; and so on up to level five. However, he has an additional level at\nthe bottom. Level zero is the oblivious organization. These organizations don’t\neven realize they're developing software. Many test groups, unaware that\ntest automation is software development, fall into this category.\n\nAny successful software development project requires that some basic rules\nbe followed. ‘Testers are often the first to complain when programmers don’t\nfollow the rules. Testers shouldn’t be surprised when test automation projects\n\nrun into trouble after cutting corners.\n\nWhat are the rules? Plan your project and establish milestones and deliverables.\nDefine requirements. Use source code control for the tools, the automation code,\nand the tests. Design tests before coding them. Review the code and test it.\n\nTrack automation bugs in a bug database. Document how to use the automation\nand plan for it to be used by people other than the ones who created it.\n\nThe failure to treat automation as software engineering has led to expensive\nautomation fiascos, such as test teams finding themselves far behind in their\n\ntesting with no useful automated tests.\n\nWe won’t tell you which development process to follow, but follow a process.\n\n, Test automation Is a significant\n), Investment.\n\nCOCO ener er eee eee Eee e rar OeeEdEO ED aNdPOTesS TORO EPA DODOE OH OES EOEREDED ODEN ORENOEOEREDOFORONEHSSOEOCEGEOEOVONESH EDEN ONSHOUSEHESESOHSHSSONOLOLOGHAHOMOEOUONEEHASHHEHELOL OTOL OES ERGhOne\n\nIt takes time and costs money to automate tests. Expect that a well-designed\nautomated test will take 10 times as long to automate using a GUI test tool as\nexecuting it manually. This figure is affected by a host of factors, but many\nexperienced automators use this as a reasonable first estimate (Kaner 1998a).\nWe have reviewed a few claims suggesting that tests can be automated with\nonly two or three times the effort. We find that these claims result from\ndeveloping throw-away tests, failing to account for the full efforts involved\nin automation, or good luck.

It can help you create and run tests that are\nexpensive or impossible to run by hand. It can help you measure aspects of\nprogram operation (timing and memory usage) that you can’t do by hand. It\ncan help you run a massive test series, looking for defects that wouldn’t\nshow up until after months of normal use and would take too long to run by\n\nhand.

As large as these costs are, we\nfind that staff costs for training (whether formal or on-the-job) and\n\nn quickly dwarf these costs.

Should you automate that testing?\nShould you test the code that automates the tests of your automation? It\nhurts just to think about it.\n\nAnother approach is to focus on reviewing your test code. Design your test\nframework to make it easy for different people to review the tests. This will\nhelp them develop faith in the tests that your team writes, and help them\ndevelop faith in the tests you write. Keep code simple. Optimize test data\nformats to the needs of the testers. Use standard programming languages.\n\nTest automation can go wrong in many ways. By making reviews possible,\nyou make major blunders much less likely. You also help your team learn\nfrom each other. As they learn to review test code, they can learn how to start\nreviewing the product code as well.\n\nA culture that encourages review leads to test automation that everyone can\njustifiably depend on.\n\nWe have limited experience with paired programming of automated tests.\nThis is another form of review, and we expect (but cannot say from\nexperience) that it will work well.\n\nsaversencccenrersvererars\n\nYou can assume that a reasonably intelligent and observant human being will\nrun manual tests.

In test automation, this approach often leads to\ntrouble. The opposite approach, which leaves the repeated code in place, is\ncalled open coding.\n\nBy their very nature, tests exhibit a lot of repetition. You test the same\nfeatures in different scenarios, different orders, or n combinations with\nvarious other features. If you simply relocate the code you see repeated, you\nend up witha hodge-podge library. Functions contain sequences of tasks that\n\nAIG | LESGONIG LEARNED UM SOFTWARE THESIING\n\nfrequently follow one another, even if they’re part of different tasks. Naming\nconventions, results analysis, and testing strategy may also find themselves\nbundled into the hodge-podge library. The functions are hard to name\nmeaningfully. In context, it’s hard to infer what they do.\n\nTests using such libraries are hard to review, hard to debug, and hard to\nrepair. We have reviewed test suites built with hodge-podge libraries on\nseveral occasions. The results are never pretty. »\n\nTest automation entails a lot of repetitive code. Useful libraries require\nstronger design principles than just avoiding the repetition of code. Useful\ntask libraries focus on encapsulating user-perceived tasks, with particular\nattention on the start and end states of the functions. This effort isn’t always\njustified. In such cases, stick with open coding.\n\n43), Data-driven test automation makes it easy\noy, to run lots of test variants. |\n\neer nr rr rrr rrr rrrrrrr rr rr rererrrririrtriititiri iii\nPPPPPTPTITTTISITITITI TTI etter\n\nTo test different inputs and input combinations with a common test\nprocedure, use data-driven test automation.\n\nOrganize your test inputs and expected outputs into tables. Each row\nconstitutes a test. Then create an automated test procedure that reads ina\nrow from your table, executes each input step, and verifies the expected\nresult. Spreadsheets are convenient for storing the test data. They make data\nentry easy. Most test tools and programming environments can access the\nspreadsheet data without much trouble. They can access the data in the\nnative spreadsheet format or in delimited text files that can easily be\nexported (.CSV files).\n\nAfter you've put together a data-driven test procedure, you can use it again\nand again to execute new tests. The technique is most powerful with product\nworkflows that have lots of different data options. Use a more complex\nvariant, keyword-driven automation, to support tests composed of varying\nsequences or several alternate paths.\n\nData-driven test automation supports nonprogramming testers. The\nautomators create the data-driven test procedures, and the testers create the\ntest data. In some cases, you might find it hard to automate the verification of\nthe test results. Have your test procedure collect the results and present them\nin the context of the input data to simplify the manual results analysis.\n\nData-driven test automation is becoming commonplace. Many test tools\ninclude direct support for this technique (Dwyer and Freeburn 1999).\n\nCOCR ODED Oren atee rT eseevenenescusasereseseaerece\nrTet ete eee ee teeter ene eeeasen een erensuaecueeserenersessuesarerenss\nCROC O rere rece nereseretearerasnereneacea\n\n“we\n\nKeyword-driven test automation makes it\nCaSy Or hOnprogrammers to create tests.\n\nKeyword-driven test automation builds on the data-driven technique.\nHowever, the tables contain directives (keywords), not just data.\n\nFirst, the approach requires a general framework that includes support for\nrunning tests as well as libraries for setup, results analysis, and reporting.\nThis will be used for all the keyword-driven tests. ,\n\nSecond, you'll have to create a task library that encapsulates the user tasks\nsupported by your product. Identify each task function that can be used in\ntesting and include an entry in the task library for each. Declare the start\nstates that the task functions are valid in and the end states that they result\nin. This lets you tell which sequences of task functions are valid and so catch\nmalformed tests.\n\nThird, add support to read spreadsheet data, a row ata time. Using the\ndeclarations, interpret the first column‘as the name of a task function. The\nfollowing columns are arguments to the function. Execute the function with\nits arguments. Then move to the next row.\n\nThe result is keyword-driven test automation. Using it avoids complex logic in\nyour test scripts (Lesson 125). Because the tests are stored in spreadsheets,\nthey’re often easy for nonprogrammers to create and review. Because the\ntasks to be used and tested are all that the tester specifies, he can concentrate\non the tests, not the control language.\n\nIn contexts that require many nonprogrammers to create automated tests, we\nbelieve this is one of the better solutions. One drawback of this approach is\nthat you can’t write a test unless supported keywords already exist for the\ntasks you require. Defining and implementing the task functions can become\n\na major undertaking. |\nReviewer Hans Buwalda reports, “Keyword driven approaches, like my own\naction words, can provide a good basis. However, over the years I have\nlearned that testing and test automation remain very challenging areas and\nneed the involvement of experienced specialists to do it right.”\n\nWe have seen good results with this technique on projects that allowed\nsignificant advance time for automation development. We also have reports\nof teams that found that this approach required too much overhead and was\n\nunsustainable.\nFor more on this technique, see Pettichord (1996) and Buwalda and Kasdorp\n(1999),\n\nF116 | LeSGOS LEARNED UN GOPOWARE TASTING\n\nGD) Use automated techniques to generate\n\n(129\n\nme ncererarersueseseseunaed\nTOR ee eee meee en ener ene eeeer esse eeesenes eens abarereneaereaeaversreranenssesrerereneses eee\n\ntest inputs.\n\nTPTTTTTITTTIS IT ee\neee eer Oren eee eet arerereanay\n\n. Common programming methods can help in several situations:\n\nCreating large files.\nCreating lots of test inputs.\n\nSetting up test beds. When load testing, start by preloading your database\nwith a realistic amount of data. The amount of data available to be\nsearched impacts database retrieval.\n\nCreating random data. This is particularly useful with data-driven and\nkeyword-driven tests.\n\nCovering all combinations of inputs. Use algorithms to generate\npermutations and combinations.\n\nHowever, using the previous methods usually leaves the expected results\nunspecified. This can entail a laborious effort to review or specify results\nmanually. The following techniques are particularly valuable because they\neither reduce the number of test cases needed, provide a certain level of\ncoverage, or specify the expected results.\n\nCovering all pairs of representatives of equivalence classes. We've seen\nstudies suggesting that most interaction bugs can be found if you test all\npair-wise combinations of key equivalence class members. We discuss the\nall-pairs combinatorial technique in Chapter 3, Testing Techniques, in the\nsection, “How to Do Combination Testing Using the All-Pairs Technique.”\n\nCovering interactions among logical conditions. When variables are not\nindependent, techniques like all-pairs combination testing break down.\nCause-effect graphing is a more robust approach (Elmendorf 1973 and\nBender 1991). We have not used this technique. We’ve heard reports of\nfailure and success in applying it.\n\nCreating test scenarios with state models. The state-model test technique has\nseen serious academic study and significant results in industry. A state\nmodel, or state chart, identifies states of a system (document changed or\nunchanged; database connected or disconnected; transaction pending or\ncompleted) and the possible transitions between them. Skilled practitioners\nare able to build interesting and useful models without creating too many\nstates. Others have sunk considerable efforts into this technique, generated\nmassive state models, and received no benefit. This is called the state-\nexplosion problem. The practitioners who see the most success are often able\nto see results shortly. If you use this technique, we suggest you create a\nstate model for a feature or two, generate tests, and then reassess from\n\nthere. If you can’t see it paying off after a week’s effort, it’s probably not\nworth further investment (Robinson 1999 and Nyman 2000).\n\ngs) Separate test generation from test\n\n' execution.\n\nORO Aeaeeeaesesaeaeneareeeeeeseeeeer Leesan ene E eae Een eRe ene nen eneneienneneren\nMONT T Ree eee enna sect enen en eseeeneerenerensasaversracensasseavasdeaseseseneeoapapecersstseueapararersescevavaravare\n\nOne strategy that supports Separating test data from the execution code is\ndata-driven test automation (Lesson 127). This separation facilitates test\ngeneration and has several advantages:\n\nci Your tests will be easier to understand and review.\n\n© You can use different test tools or programming environments for the\ngeneration and execution.\n\nci A separate test case generator is easier to test. If you're using random _\nmethods, you should know that random number algorithms packaged\nwith programming environments are often weak. Your data could be less\nrandom than you expected. Check and see (Park and Miller 1988). Kaner\nand Vokey (1984) provide a thoroughly tested set of parameters for a\nrandom number generator that you can program easily in Java or any\nother language that handles high-precision integer arithmetic.\n\n1 Tests are easier to repeat when the data is pregenerated. We've seen test\nscripts that changed the test every time they ran. If you can’t pregenerate\nthe data, you need to take other measures to ensure repeatability, such as\nlogging the data or the seed used to generate it. Instrumenting your test\nscripts to use these logs adds complications.\n\n& You'll have an easier time reporting any bugs found.

Scripting languages are high-\nlevel languages optimized for ease of use rather than execution performance.\n\n(AIBC EESSORIS LEANED UN COLIN TESTING\n\nMany programmers are more productive and less error prone when they use\nscripting languages instead of system programming languages such as\nC/C++ or Java.\n\nScripting languages are very appropriate for most test automation. You can\nuse them to generate test data, access programming interfaces, and validate\nresults.\n\nMany test tools have built-in scripting languages. Some wisely use standard\nscripting languages. Others have created their own proprietary languages,\nwhich we call vendorscripts. We see no compelling reasons for using them and\nnote several problems. —_\n\nThey make coding difficult. Many of these are based on standard languages\nlike C. If you can read C, you can probably read a C-based vendorscript.\nBut you'll have a heck of a time writing much valid code. These\nvendorscripts won’t support many of the standard language idioms, which\nmakes writing much code about as easy as writing English without using\nthe letter N. |\n\nThey’re hard to learn. The difficulty of finding training or books on\nvendorscripts makes them hard to learn. And if you do learn them, you\ncan’t use them for anything else. So, it’s hard to motivate people to learn\nthem. If you're hiring, it’ll be hard to find people who already know them.\n\nThey interfere with collaboration between testers and programmers. We\nrecommend that automation projects receive cooperation from both testers\nand product programmers. This becomes complicated when you're\nliterally using different languages.\n\nIt’s hard to build on the work of others. The libraries that are available for\nvendorscripts are pitiful compared to what is available for standard\nlanguages. This means that you’re not going to be able to build on the\nwork of others but will be spending your time rebuilding rudimentary\nlibraries.\n\nWe suggest you avoid using tools with vendorscripts. More and more test\ntools are now using standard languages. If you must use a tool with a\nvendorscript, try to reduce the amount of code that must be written in the\ntool and do as much processing as possible in a separate language\nenvironment.‘\n\n4 For further discussion, see Pettichord (2001a).\n\nNuoinenting itesirigy | 119 |\n\nFr\n\nee ON N.\n\ngso, Automate tests using programming\n\n“ym interfaces.\n\nTOMO U eNO e eee eer er enone ur east ererenereereserenencs\nee NAA ceases susesesitneesiitstusitunssitsstibisibesasecsuscsesccescceccccccasccusssussutsutotsee\nPOR e ner ese drenerererenecoererereneneneeesroner\n\nNowadays, many software products have programming interfaces (public\nAPIs) that can be used for testing.

On a technical level, it’s actually more complicated than other\ninterface technologies. One way or another you'll have to learn the details of\nthe interface technology that your automated tests use. It’s your choice. We\n\nthink the GUI should be last on your list.\n\nHere’s a quick example. Lots of people have asked us for advice on\nautomating installers using GUI test tools. The best approach is usually to\nchuck the tool. Most installers have scripting interfaces that provide a better\napproach. InstallShield, for example, is a popular install system that is used\nto create installers for many products. Many testers don’t know they can run\nInstallShield installers with an option to record your selected install options.\nThese are stored in a response file. The installer can later be run unattended,\nusing the response file to specify the install options. It’s easy; it’s cheap; and\nthe response file is simple to read and edit. It’s a cost-effective way of\nautomating installation (see Creating a Silent Installation http://support\ninstallshield.com/kb/display.asp?documents_id=101901).\n\nBut you're not testing the GUI!—Focus your attention on where automation\ncan help the most. Sometimes, you can effectively automate the GUI; other\ntimes you can’t. Don’t let people’s preconceptions of what automation has to\nlook like limit you.\n\n5.

Most\nmanagers expect their programmers to unit test, and most programmers\nclaim that they do. Actual practice, however, is extremely variable and often\nhard to confirm.\n\nTrue unit testing tests units in isolation. Stubs are created to handle outgoing\ncalls, and drivers are created to provide incoming calls. Building these stubs\ncan be a major effort.\n\nA more popular form of automated unit testing avoids stub development by\n\ntesting units in context. We might call this unit integration testing. For systems\nthat are built from the bottom up, this form of automation can be rather easy\nto automate.\n\nYou will need a scaffolding such as Junit or Xunit to manage test suite\nexecution. This isn’t too hard or too expensive. The code is tested through the\nnormal calling interfaces that the languages support.

But if managers are\nrequesting more test automation, they should know the many ways that both\nprogrammers and testers can help. If programmers show an interest in unit\ntesting, we suggest that you provide assistance. Unit testing is seen as a core\n\npractice of extreme programming and other agile methods (Beck 1999 and\nBeck et al. 2001).\n\nso Beware of using automators who don’t\n\n#) understand testing.\n\nede\n\nVo gavereusanavavareracerece seer asar eres een eenreeeu erase ees ener aE aHeen er searanereesessnatarereversseueece\nWeve se enewevevererevecnsnar\n\nAP avo vat eneerererevarsenererenerereuseeenetarsrasareveresrene\n\nAutomation requires programmers. What kind of programmers do you want?\n\nMost programmers think they know a lot about testing. Unless they’re\nterribly irresponsible, they test their own code a lot and often find they have\nto test other code that they’re trying to use. They do know a lot about testing,\nexcept as compared to someone who focuses all his energy on testing:\nsomeone like you! | |\n\nFrom the perspective of a tester, many programmers don’t actually know\nmuch about software testing (just as many testers don’t know much about\nprogramming). What they do know is often based on testing their own code.\nThey overemphasize strategies appropriate to their own idiosyncrasies. _\nPeople who understand testing requirements better should provide input\nand review. |\n\nProgrammers’ lack of knowledge about testing becomes a bigger problem when\ncombined with the disdain that many programmers hold for testers. This disdain\nstems from a perception that testers are under-informed about software in\ngeneral. Consequently, programmers may deliver automation that is quite\nclearly different from what was requested or expected. To guard against this,\nplan to review the test automation code. Programmers are accustomed to being\ngiven requirements they don’t fully understand. A common strategy they use is\nto make a best guess, write a program, and then fix it later based on feedback.\nThis strategy is understandable given the vagueness and confusion that often\ntiddle requirements and other programming requests. The danger comes when\nthis strategy is applied to test automation. Don’t make the mistake of thinking\nthat simply running the test suite will tell you if it works. Some test suite bugs\nwill cause tests to fail; these you'll find and fix. Others will cause tests to pass\nwhen they have no right to, and you'll never know it. Use reviews, design\n\nStrategies, and testing to guard against this.\n\n\\\n\neneuacecensacevenensnonoararersrerenes eset\n\nSome responsible programmers may realize that they don’t know enough\nabout testing as they work on the automation project.

Testability often provides a better\nsolution with less effort. Some examples:\n\no After installing a product, users (and testers) had to search through a log\nto see if there were any installation errors. How do you automate this\ntesting? The first idea was to write a script that would search through the\ninstall log for possible error messages. A better idea was to build this in as\na feature of the product. It would probably be more reliable, would get\nbetter testing, and would actually benefit users directly.\n\nTesters needed to simulate media errors on tape backup software, to test\nwhether the software recovered gracefully. These are hard to simulate\n\nwith automation. It would prob\nsimulator. Instead, testers work\nlow-level tape writing code to (\n\nably have required creating a tape drive\ned with the programmers to allow the\nfalsely) indicate that the media was bad.\no Assertions are statements in the code that signal errors if assumptions are\nfalse. Assertions can be placed in the software under test to check that\nresults are reasonable. This is often easier and mor\n\ne efficient than writing\nexternal code to verify results.\n\nAny features that aid your ability to observe or control software operations\nimprove testability. People often ask us for lists of potential features. Our list\nfollows: |\n\nAccess to the source code. Many companies will not allow testers to modify\nsource code. However, you might still have access to view code. It is\nparticularly important to be able to inspect change-records in the source\ncontrol system. | |\n\nLogging. Log error messages, sources of errors, usage profiles, resource —\nutilization, system messages, and protocol communications. Allow\ndifferent levels of logging to.be specified. Logging mechanisms may\nalready be present in the components used in your product. Programmers\nuse logs to help with debugging. You can use them to catch bugs sooner,\nanalyze bug patterns, provide detailed information in your reports, assess\nyour test coverage, gather information on customer usage, and learn more\nabout the software that you’re testing (DiMaggio 2000, Johnson 2001, and\nMarick 2000). | 7\n\nDiagnostics. Diagnostics can alert you of potential problems. Assertions are\none example. Data integrity checks verify that data is internally consistent.\nCode integrity checks verify that programs haven’t been overwritten or\nmodified. Memory integrity checks verify that memory is being used\naccording to allocations. This can be a powerful tool when combined with\nlogging, allowing you to enter debug mode or dump program information\nwhen an error is detected (Kaner 2000b).’ |\n\nError simulation.

Allow data to be inspected or modified at various points in the\nsystem (Cohen 2000).\n\nEvent triggers. Notifications of when internal tasks begin and end can help\nsynchronize tests. .\n\nReading obsolete data formats. Data formats may change several times\nwhile a product is in development. Provide means to convert data to the\nnew formats so it doesn’t have to be recreated.\n\nTest interfaces. Programming interfaces are a major benefit for testability. A\nfew products have actually added programming interfaces for this reason.\n\nCustom control support. Allowing GUI test tools to work with custom user\ninterface controls is probably one of the most requested testability features.\n\nPermitting multiple instances. Allow multiple clients or agents to run on the\nsame machine, even if this isn’t supported in the field. This can allow\ntesters to simulate a large network in a small lab.\n\nMany software products have undocumented testability features that\n\nprogrammers have added to assist with their own testing and debugging.\nAsk about them.®\n\nAutomation is hard work, requiring planning, research, and design. If you're\nplanning for lots of automated testing, start while the product is still being\ndesigned. You often have to address testability issues to automate effectively.\nHard to specify in advance, testability solutions often result from trial and\nerror.\n\nProgrammers are more open to testability suggestions early in the project.\nThe features are easier to add when the design is still in flux. The\nprogrammer and project manager can put them on a schedule and budget\n\nsOn one embedded software project, Kaner and Hoffman discovered that the programming group had\nwritten more than 1100 diagnostic commands to check the state of the software and the device.

This is often a wise arrangement.\n\nIf you’re on such a team, make sure you have a clear charter describing the\nkind of assistance you give, how requests should be placed, and how you'll\nbalance conflicting demands. This is important because the teams that are in\nthe most trouble and clamoring for the most help are often the least able to\nbenefit from automation. It’s easier for them to say that they need help with\nautomation, which is a technical skill, than that they need help getting their\nwork organized, which presumably they should be able to do themselves. —\nNot handling this well can lead you to being sucked into a vortex of\nineffectiveness.\n\nWe suggest that you require teams receiving assistance to dedicate staff to\nwork with you on automation projects.

(See Chapter 3, Testing\nTechniques, for examples of tables and matrices.) Instead, we provide\nquestions that might help you.decide what you need. |\n\nThis chapter starts out with a detailed evaluation of IEEE Standard 829 on\nSoftware Testing Documentation. We realize that you might never have read\nor even heard of this Standard—the IEEE sells the standard at a price high\nenough to probably dissuade most individuals from buying a copy-* We've\nmet very few people who have their own copy of Standard 829. Not many of\nour client or employer companies have bought IEEE standards either.\nHowever, many of the test documentation templates that float around the\nfield are derived from Standard 829. So, even though you may not know it by\nits name, if you’ve been in the field for a while, you’ve probably run into\nStandard 829.\n\nIf you haven’t encountered Standard 829 and are not interested in test\ndocumentation templates, we suggest that you skip ahead to Lesson 147:\nAnalyze your requirements before deciding what products to build; this applies as\nmuch to your documentation as to your software.\n\n‘We checked prices at www.ieee.org on July 30, 2001. Print copies of Standard 829 (64 pages, softbound) cost\n$65 to the public and $52 to IEEE members. Electronic access costs $98 to the public or $78 to members.\nReaders interested in a larger collection of standards can order the four-volume Software Engineering\n\nStandards 1999 set for $325 ($260 for members) or the Software Engineering Standards Subscription online\n\nnew eee are eee eee me ae\n\n130 PES SWRI NeARNED (is SOFTWARE 7 ESTING :\nThe most recent document promoting Standard 829 is the Software\nEngineering Body of Knowledge, which we discuss here.\n\nWe quoted the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Version 0,95\n2001) in the preface. We'll have more to say about it in Chapter 10, Your Career\nin Software Testing. In this chapter, we note the SWEBOK position on test\n\ndocumentation:\n\nTest documentation and workproducts\n\nDocumentation is an integral part of the formalization of the test .\n\nprocess. The IEEE Standard for Software Test Documentation [829] a\nprovides a good description of test documents and of their relationship PY;\nwith one another and with the testing process. Test documents include, | “ee\namong others, Test Plan, Test Design Specification, Test Procedure a\n‘Specification, Test Case Specification, Test Log and Test Incident or\n\nProblem Report. The program under test, with specified version and\n\nidentified hw/sw requirements before testing can begin, is documented\n\nas the Test Item. Test documentation should be produced and\n\ncontinually updated, at the same standards as other documentation in\n\ndevelopment. (IEEE Computer Society 2001, 92)\n\nWe've attempted to develop IEEE Standard 829-style documentation, and |\nwe've seen the results of efforts by several other companies spanning several\nindustries. We haven’t been happy with the results. In fact, in our experience, | iy,\n\n; WY\n\nStandard 829 has probably done more harm than good. MME\n\nA>\n\nKe\n\nPart of our frustration with Standard 829 is the extent to which test groups\nhave gotten themselves into trouble by attempting to follow it. Group after\neroup has created test-planning templates based on Standard 829 and then\ncreated worthless documents that followed the template. Initially, we thought\nthat the problem was in the people; they misapplied the standard. Later, we\nconcluded that the problem must be deeper because it was widespread, and\nit snared people who we respected.\n\nThe pattern (or anti-pattern) that we saw was that a test group would create\nor borrow a template and invest a substantial initial burst of paperwork-\nfilling energy that yielded an initial not-very-informative mass of material.\nThey then ran into the costs and constraints of this type of documentation\neffort and gradually abandoned it. This left many groups to do purely ad hoc\ntesting, because they had squandered all their planning time and budget on\npaperwork they would not use.\n\nAbandoning the effort didn’t mean that they publicly repudiated their work;\nusually, they silently stopped reading or updating it. If you asked them about\n\ntest documentati 4:\n(which no one ioe ney were likely to produce the big binder full of paper\nmg or updating).

Accordingly, we have listed lessons from both sides of the\ndebate regarding test documentation standards. We hope that you will think\nfirst about the problem that your test document needs to solve and then\napply a form appropriate to the solution.\n\nDon’t use test documentation templates:\n\n>, Atemplate won't help unless you don’t -\n14s, need it. | a\n\nS yf . .\na\n\nA test documentation template is no substitute for skill.\n\nA template is a structure for creating test documentation. Fill in the sections\nor fill in the blanks, and you have your documentation. |\n\nThe problem with templates is they make it easier to write a content-free\ndocument that looks good superficially. For some people that’s a plus. But to\nuse a template to write good test documentation, you have to own it. You must\nunderstand what each section of the template means, why it’s there at all, and\nwhen it should be deleted. If you know all that, you dont need a template. If\nyou don’t know that, don’t mess with templates. They'll steer you in |\ncounterproductive directions because you won’t understand the requirements\nand tradeoffs that were balanced in the mind of the templates’ author.\n\nWe've seen several organizations that created templates for themse'ves but\nused them ineffectively or counterproductively. The person using the\ntemplate must be able to adapt it to the requirements at hand.\n\nIf you can writing effective test documentation without using a template, you\nmay find that a template helps you write effective documentation more\n\nquickly.\n\noy Use test documentation templates: They\n\nia, foster consistent communication.\nSuppose that you have to present your work to a third party. Perhaps you are\nwriting test documentation that will be delivered to a customer as part of a\ncustom-engineered product. The customer will take over maintenance and\ntesting from here. Or perhaps you are writing test documentation that .\nanother company will use to test a product. Or perhaps you are writing test\ndocumentation that will be inspected by auditors or regulators or that might\nbe used as courtroom evidence of good or bad testing after an accident\ninvolving your company’s product kills someone. In each of these cases, your\n\n- material will communicate more effectively.and people will find your\n\n~ material easier to use if you use a standard, predictable format, present\nthings in standard places, cover a standard set of issues, and use standard\nterminology. = ee\n\ni\n\n(>. Use the IEEE Standard 829 for test\n18 —_\n\nH\n\n148; documentation.\n\nThe IEEE Standard 829 project was led by David Gelperin. He is a smart,\nthoughtful, considerate, open-minded person who has done a tremendous\namount to foster diversity, creativity and the development and application of\nskill in the software testing field. His company, Software Quality Engineering\n(SQE), organizes the STAR Conference (Software Testing Analysis & Review),\nwhich is one of the field’s best and most successful conferences. SQE hosts\nseveral other conferences. We are regular speakers at SQE conferences. SQE\nalso offers courses to the testing community, and we have taught courses for\n~ SQE. Our criticism of Standard 829 is not a criticism of David, who we\n\nconsider a good friend, nor of the many public services that SQE has proudly\nprovided, at its own expense, to the software testing community.\n\nMany attributes of Standard 829 reflect David’s strengths. None of the many\n\ncategories of information in the standard is fluff. When we read the standard,\nwe can understand why someone would want to know each and every piece\nof information that the standard calls for.\n\nNothing in the standard is mandatory. If you want to create procedurally\nscripted test cases, Standard 829 tells you what to call them and where in the\n\n_.. Ghepker Gs Doammenting tkesamg | [133 |\n\ndoce put them. If you don’t Write test cases this way, you don’t have\nto create this type of documentation just to Satisfy the standard. The standard\n\nprovides a framework, a structure, and a set of definitions, not a mandated\nset of sections. ,\n\nThe standard has been widely studied and discussed. People in the field\nknow about it. This standard has been the basis for many (perhaps most) of\nthe test documentation templates that circulate from company to company. It\nhas become the basis of conversation about test planning and test\ndocumentation (for better or worse) in and across many companies.\n\nTwo of us, Bach and Kaner, have served as trial consultants (experts for use at\ntrial) in cases involving defective products, and colleagues of ours have\nserved in other cases and given us detailed debriefings. We’ve seen cases in\nwhich poor test documentation has been a part of an underlying problem\nthat led to litigation. Even if the documentation was not a key problem, some\nof the companies whose products were allegedly defective or who were\naccused of fraud would have been better served if their test documents were\nclearer and better organized. Their mess weakened their defense. IEEE\nStandard 829 could have saved those companies a lot of money and might\nhave helped them save their customers a lot of money.\n\nne Don’t use the IEEE Standard 829.\n\n\\\n1\naN\nNe\nx.\n\nEach of us was enthusiastic about IEEE Standard 829 when we first read it.\nHowever, we have seen several problems in practice. When we would\ncomment on these problems, we sometimes were told that the problems are\ndue to misuse of the standard. After all, it is very flexible. Testers don’t have\nto use the standard in an inappropriate way. _ |\n\nTo us, this feels like a “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people” type of\nargument. Sometimes this is a valid argument, but sometimes it’s not.\nRegarding the IEEE 829 case, we have seen problems enough times, in the\nhands of people we respect, in use by companies who have been working\nwith 829-based templates for several projects, that we believe that the\nproblems reflect weakness in the Standard, and they should not be dismissed\nas reflecting incompetence of the people using it.\n\nThe argument, “Guns don’t kill people” reads differently if the gun in\nquestion has a hair trigger and no safety and is left loaded in a public place\nwith an official-looking notice that says, “Use this gun for all projects.”\n\nHere are some of the issues that we have with the Standard, in practice:\n\n© The assumption underlying the Standard appears to be a waterfall-like\napproach in which tests are developed early, documented carefully, and\n\nt\n\nILE SSNS WEAMRHEDD UA) SOL TALE THES TUINES\n\nthen not changed. The cost of change (the maintenance cost of the\ndocuments) has a chilling effect on change. In our view, you should create\nnew tests that are more complex as the program gets more stable and\nmore powerful as you gain more insight. To the extent that maintenance\ncosts of test documentation encourage you to reuse old tests instead of\ndeveloping more powerful new ones and to stick with your current\ntesting strategy instead of improving it as you learn, the test .\ndocumentation is part of the problem and not part of the process.\n\nMassive test documents create a compliance mentality. Do what the plan\n\nThis is fundamentally different from the mentality of the alert,\n\nsays.\ny ntion to any hints available and follows up all\n\ncritical tester who pays atte\n\npromising leads. |\n\nThe standard provides no structure for analysis of the test documentation\n\nrequirements. It provides no suggestions or guidelines regarding when to\n\nprovide what type of information. |\n\n© There is no apparent awareness and no discussion of the (enormous) cost\nof providing all of these types of information. Time spent on that\ndocumentation may well be time not spent on testing.\n\nm The standard appears to emphasize breadth of documentation. More\nseems to be better. It appears to be a good thing to generate a Test Plan, Test\nDesign Specification, Test Procedure Specification, Test Case Specification,\nand so on. |\n\nm There are no criteria for deciding whether specific instances of test _\ndocumentation are good or bad. In practice, volume seems to be the\naccepted substitute for clarity and coverage. We have reviewed or audited\nenormous test documents, that the authors considered adequate or\ncomplete, only to discover gaping holes—key testing strategies or areas of\nrisk were completely missing. It is too easy to overlook the absence of\neven the most obvious tests when the test documents run hundreds or\nthousands of pages. .\n\nm1 The maintenance costs of these long documents are enormous. When the\nsoftware changes, you don’t just have to change the parts of the\ndocumentation that are tied to that aspect of the software. You have to\nsearch everything else to figure out what has to change. This is a parallel\neffort to searching through and changing your actual test files (code files if\nyou automate). If the correspondence between documentation and code is\nnot 1-to-1, there will be mismatches, and these will bring on their own\nmischief and time costs later.\n\n| Documenting every test can seriously interfere with automated testing. If\nit takes an hour of documentation time per test case (we think this is'‘an\nunderestimate), and you want 10,000 automated tests on your project (this\n\nD.

You also pay the cost of testing that the auto ate dt\naccurately implement the tests as documented. When the tests ch ~\nbecause of maintenance of the software under test, so will the test ae\ndocumentation, resulting in even more tester-hours. This is a huge tax\n\nthe automated testing effort. Companies that follow it will write few ~\ntests, and they may discard tests rather than face the cost of maintain: ;\nboth them and their associated documentation. In our ex erience ve\ncompanies have been much mote likely to simply give up on the\ndocumentation, eventually rendering valueless whatever documentation-\n\nrelated labor they spent to that point (because it is incomplete, and it\nquickly goes out of date). | . ’\n\n= Automated testing paradigms that involve high volumes of tests\n(millions) generated or combined with random data or random sequences\nseem entirely foreign to the Standard. We can imagine shoe-horning the\nsoftware documentation and the associated software models into the\nStandard’s categories, but we don’t see that done in practice. Instead, we\nsee that these efforts (models, code, oracles, and so on) are documented _\nelsewhere or not at all. | | |\n\ncm We previously mentioned our experience in lawsuits. We'll conclude this\nlist of issues by mentioning a different experience. Several companies start\nwith a carefully signed-off statement that the testing process will be\ndocumented to a certain degree, that a template (based on 829) will be\nfollowed, that the testing strategy will be thus and so. Then they get part\nway through the project and abandon the signed-off statement in favor of,\nas they see it at the time, getting real work done on a real schedule. They\nmight have made the exactly correct decision, but think about how this\nplays in a lawsuit. They started with a thorough plan and an industry\nstandard, then they quietly followed a lesser practice, and then they\nreleased a defective product. This looks bad, bad, bad. If you're not going\nto follow an over-ambitious plan, and your company has any risk of being\nsued, don’t start your project by saying that you're going to follow that\nplan. An over-ambitious plan can do much more harm than good.\n\nHaving listed these costs, we come back to the question of benefits. If we\nspend all this money, add all this inertia to our projects, and encourage our\nstaff to run their brains at a lower setting when they do (as opposed to write\nabout) testing, what do we get back in return?\n\nMany companies use substantially less paper. They track their status using a\ncollection of brief lists and tables, status reports, and regular team meetings.\nThey track their problems via well-written bug reports stored in a well-run,\n\nbug-tracking system. What added benefits would these companies gain from\nfollowing Standard 829? How compelling are those benefits under your\ncircumstances?\n\nIn many contexts, the added benefits are not compelling. In such Cases, given\nthe added costs and risks associated with developing and maintaining large\ntest documentation sets, we submit that creating Standard 829-style\n\ndocumentation would be irresponsible.\n\nAnalyze your requirements before\ndeciding what products to build; this\n{$8 applies as much to your documentation as\na7, to your software. | ,\n\nYour decision about what to include in a test documentation set and what to\nskip should be governed by your project’s needs. IEEE Standard 829’s format\nand categories might be useful, and they might not. Until you have\ncompleted your documentation requirements analysis, the choice of IEEE\nStandard 829 (or any other detailed specification) as your structure and user\ninterface is, to say the least, premature. |\n\nWe don’t understand the mentality of someone who insists that code should\nnever be written without a thorough requirements analysis but who is\nwilling to write a large set of test documentation without a correspondingly\nthorough requirements analysis.\n\nPlease do not misunderstand this. We're not saying that IEEE Standard 829 is\ninappropriate for your product. It might be the perfect thing. Just like\nCOBOL might be the perfect language for your project. All we’re saying is,\nthink about what you're going to build before you choose your programming\nlanguage and your key tools. |\n\n_ To analyze your test documentation\n(seq. requirements, ask questions like the ones\n\nmy im this list.\n\nWe recommend Gause and Weinberg (1989) for a solid introduction to\nrequirements analysis and for an excellent collection of context-free questions\nthat are useful for any requirements analysis.

Rather than slow down (and bulk up the test docs) for testers\nwho can’t develop their own skills and look up their own answers, we\nreplace people who can’t cut it with people who can. If you think that\ndetailed instruction is necessary, we caution that it takes a lot of skill to\nwrite effective, detailed instructions. For a light-hearted introduction to\nthese issues, read Wurman (1991). Another critical aspect of delegation is\nyour ability to determine what someone did and how well she did it. If\nyou have someone mark up a very concise document (such as one of the\nmatrices that we illustrated in the Addendum to Chapter 3, Testing\nTechniques) you might see patterns more readily than if you have to flip\nthrough dozens or hundreds of pages of marked-up test scripts.\n\nWhat are your assumptions about the skills and knowledge of new testers?\nAll writing is to an audience.

Don’t fall into this pattern of mistreatment.\nProgrammers are not coding machines. They have feelings, and most care a\nlot about the work they do.\n\nMany programmers mistreat testers. We think the best way to prevent or\ncounteract bad relations is to build personal relationships based on mutual\nrespect. Assume that the individuals you work with are worthy of respect\nand act on that assumption. Do your work in a way that should earn their\nrespect. Refuse to accept mistreatment or abuse.\n\nAs an official critic of the programmer’s work, you must demonstrate\nsensitivity, appreciation, and diplomacy. Don’t go overboard as a cheerleader,\nbut let people know when you see value in their work. If their work is poor,\ndon’t be nasty about it.\n\nBe open and honest in your dealings with programmers.

Start by doing your homework. Read the available documents. If you\ncan, look at the code.\n\nProgrammers’ documents will be confusing in places. Ask them about\nsections that seem important but that you don’t understand. Sometimes you\ncan use email for questions, but often face-to-face conversations work better,\nespecially for follow-up questions. If they agree to a meeting, come prepared\nso that you don’t waste their time.\n\nIf they don’t have documents, ask for a picture of the system. Most\nprogrammers have an image of the system that they’re working on in their\nminds and will be happy to share it. |\n\nYou may get them to diagram the system on a whiteboard. One technique is\nto point to a random arrow or box and ask, “What happens if this fails?” This\ncan uncover missing error handling or unquestioned assumptions.

They try to do\ngood work, know that they can make mistakes, and expect you to find those\nmistakes.\n\nFor a tester, testability is anything that makes it easier to test software. When\ntalking to programmers, a more practical definition is testability is visibility\n\nand control (Lesson 137). This definition states the nature of the features that\nwill help you. Understanding that, they can suggest features that you haven't\nthought of (or didn’t ask for) but that will be helpful. What kinds of features\nshould you ask for? Lesson 137, Testability is Visibility and Control, provides a\nnumber of examples.\n\nMany testers have been frustrated in their attempts to get testability features\nfrom programmers. We believe that there are three key points to being\nsuccessful with such requests.\n\nSpeak their language. It is helpful if you can read design documents and\ncode. You have to put your requests in terms they can understand. If you\nae Specify exactly what interface you want in what part of the code,\n\n; 0 in give your request a fair hearing.

But usually, we believe, these\nare code phrases for “we don’t want to think about it.” Making your case\nmay require some salesmanship to help programmers realize that helping\nyou is ultimately to their own benefit. You may have to seek out the right\nprogrammer, someone with the vision and influence to make it happen.\nNonetheless, if you know what you're asking for, ask at the right time, and\nask nicely, we think you can get constructive consideration of your requests.\n\nWe have seen many testability features that made significant benefits to\nproduct testing. Some were provided at the request of one of us. Others were\nsuggested by testers or programmers on the teams. It can be a difficult case to\nmake, but a worthwhile one. We encourage perseverance.\n\na\n\nmanaging the Testing Project\n\na tah he Ae arcana int ahi nth tone etna cata te tah ee\n\nrespects. But there’s at least one special feature of a testing project: It’s driven\nby the programming project. What you do is a reaction to what they do.\nThat’s why using a tool like Microsoft Project to plot the tasks of testing can\nbe so frustrating. You have to squint pretty hard to fit the work of your team\ninto those little Gantt bars. In this chapter, we review the lessons we've\nlearned about the dynamics of testing projects and how to control them.\n\nMe a testing project is like managing any other kind of project—in some\n\n87 Create a service culture.\n\nProject teams develop software in order to provide benefits to customers.\nThe customers might be in-house or external, paying or nonpaying. The\ncustomers might be the same people as the developers (for example, when\nwe build our own tools). |\n\nTesters provide services to the overall project. A typical service is finding and\neporting bugs. Other services depend on your group’s mission (see Chapter\n1, “The Role of the Tester”)\n\none of the fundamental issues running through the testing literature and the\nesting subcultures is whether your role is primarily service or control:\n\noA service provider controls the quality and relevance of the services he\nProvides to the larger effort to develop the end result.

The worst and\nd. We think that much of that a most\ndogmatic of it comes from testers and consultants whose product\ndevelopment experience is limited to testing (or otherwise measuring or\n\nevaluating) the work of others.\n\nTesters often see projects at their worst. Testers face the consequences of poor and\nincomplete decisions and half-done tasks, without noticing the planning and\nwork that allowed the product to get as good as it is. What appear to be poor and\nincomplete decisions are often thoughtful business decisions with which you\ndisagree. It is easy to believe that you know better and would do it better.\n\nTesters often receive,\n\nSome processes make it easier or harder for testers. However, a competent test\ngroup can provide solid services to a wide range of project managers, who work\nunder very different project management styles, including the inconvenient ones\nand the ones that make the testing part of the project less efficient.\n\nSome processes seem destined to produce bad products. This is a serious\nproblem; someone should manage this. Unfortunately, the worst group to\nmanage this is the testing group. Testing groups don’t have the resources, the\n\nexperience, or the political power to fix the broader development processes\nor to manage the fixed processes.\n\nWe are not saying that you (the human being who is doing testing today) should\n\n‘en voit and ed in it.

Project managers get annoyed, complain, and are told by their peers\nand managers to stop whining: Testers will be testers.\n\nOther companies have a more hierarchical attitude. In their cultures, it would\nbe inappropriate for a tester to visit a marketer or a technical support\nmanager to discuss a problem with a product under development.\n\nIf your task is to help the company make the right business decisions about\nthe defects that you find, your effectiveness is limited if you cannot\ncommunicate your findings to the people in the business who are most\naffected by those defects. If you can’t communicate those findings directly, in\none-on-one meetings, you can communicate them indirectly. For example,\nyou can give people access rights to the bug-tracking database and teach\nthem how to use it to find problems that might interest them.

Even though they might have a good idea of what they want, they\ndon’t know how to specify their requirements because:\n\nSoft\nthis pro\n\noi They don’t know all of their requirements.\n\na Their requirements will change as they try early versions of the software\nor competitors’ products.

As the project progresses, the requirements change. _\n\n%, Projects involve a tradeoff among\n16, features, reliability, time, and money.\n\nThe project manager’s job is to deliver the right set of features, at an\nappropriate level of reliability, on time, and within budget.

While you use a critical resource (a specially skilled\nPerson or a unique machine) on your project, that resource is not available\nto some other project.\n\nWe characterize this as a tradeoff because the project manager can gain more\n\n0 one dimension by spending or sacrificing more on another.

The lifecycle models differ in what they leave open.\n\nSome companies follow a standard lifecycle model, but in our experience,\nthere is always some room for customization by the project manager. The\nwise project manager picks the approach that controls the things he finds\ndifficult to manage fluidly and leaves open the issues he has particular\nstrength in. Every choice carries risks and consequences. The choice is not\nalways convenient for the testing group, and it is not always the choice that\n\nyou would make. To the extent that there is a choice, it belongs to the project\nmanager.\n\nm the next two lessons, we look at the waterfall and evolutionary lifecycles.\ne waterfall, so often advocated by testing consultants, doesn’t always\n\nSuppor our interests.

This is called\nthe V-Model. At the end of each phase, testers formally evaluate the work\nproduct of that phase. For example, testers review (and, presumably,\napprove) the requirements documents at the end of the requirements\ndefinition phase.

They told the salesman\nthis wouldn’t work, because the programmers could be expected to make late\nchanges to the software's user interface and feature set. He responded that\nthe testers should push the programmers to do real engineering. Real\nengineering, he said, means freezing the user interface and feature set\nrelatively early in the project. Then the testers could do their jobs.\n\nThe primary value of a pitch like this is that it helps you recognize that this\nsalesman (and his company) is someone you don’t want to do business with.\nLike the bad advice mentioned before (refuse to test unless they give youa\nspecification, Lesson 173), it is unreasonable to predicate your methods on\nthings that the programming group in your company won't do.\n\nIn the Midwestern United States, houses have basements. Historically, the\nbasement was, among other things, a place where you took shelter if there\nwas a tornado. Of course, you don’t have to go to the expense of building a\nbasement.

However, that declaration might not do much\ngood, especially when the next tornado comes through.\n\nProgrammers are like tornadoes. Think of them as forces of nature. They will\ndo what they do.

If that tester’s estimate is much longer\nthan your estimate, don’t start by trying to get him to change his estimate.\nInstead, try to understand what he sees as the scope of the task, what else he\nis doing, and what other factors lead him to the seemingly high number.

It passed review on the first\nattempt, too. But, I’ve also seen cases where something like that\nhappened, and it really took much longer.

This makes ratios incomparable across companies.\n\nSecond, the ratio focuses attention on itself, rather than on the work being\ndone. Suppose that on the last project, the programmers spent 16 person-\nmonths designing and writing code, and the testers spent 24 person-months\nfinding bugs. The ratio (24-to-16 or 3-to-2) is accurate but uninformative.\nChange the proportion of new code to third-party code, the amount of code\nthat can be reused from previous projects, the balance of troubleshooting\nresponsibilities in bug reports so that testers do more (or less) troubleshooting\nthis time than last time, or many other variables, and the ratio from the last\nproject is wrong for this one.

If the project team can fix an average of 40 bugs a week, and 400 open\nbugs are supposed to be fixed before release, you can make a persuasive case\nthat the product won't be ready to ship in the next month.\n\nBug counts are not useful for demonstrating that the project is close to release\nquality. If the open bug count is low near the desired end of the project, does\nthis mean that the product is more stable, or that the test team is spending\ntoo much time writing reports, running regression tests (tests that rarely find\nnew bugs), demonstrating the product at tradeshows, and doing other\n\nactivities that aren’t geared toward finding new bugs?

No single measurement dimension is\ne\n\nsufficient.\n\nx\n\nFor example, one commonly recommended measure is the percentage of\nlines of code (lines plus branches or others of the several variations of this)\n\nthat have been executed during testing.\n\nAs with bug counts, the lines-of-code measure is useful for showing how far\naway you are from adequacy or completeness. If you have only tested 10\npercent of the lines of code, you should not have much confidence in the\nsoftware's reliability. As you get near 100 percent line coverage, that doesn’t\ntell you the product is near release. It just tells you that the product is no\nlonger obviously far from release according to this measure. (See Marick 1999\n\nfor additional commentary on this measure.)\n\nSuppose that you are developing a product for the mass market. You decide ~\nto test it on a dozen different variations of Windows, running under another\ndozen browser versions, using 10 different connections (modems at different\nspeeds, Ethernet, etc.), and so on for several other configuration variables.\nYou might boil this down to 100 standard configurations that the program\nmust be compatible with, testing against all 100.\n\na After you've tested the product on the first few configurations, running\nyour config tests against the others might not execute a single additional\nline of code or take the program down a single additional branch. If we\nthink that lines of code is a measure of how close we are to being done,\nthis should tell us to stop doing configuration testing. That decision\nwould probably be disastrous for a mass-market product. _\n\n If100 standard configurations exist and you have tested 30 of them, you\nhave a coverage measure that is independent of lines of code but still very\nImportant. You are at 30 percent complete for configuration testing.\n\nA Coverage measure involves a population of possible tests of a given type, a\n\nSubset of that population that you intend to run, and another subset that you\n\neve actually run.

Simpler metrics are\n\ninadequate.\n\nc For example, if you focus on quarterly profits, you are likely to encourage\nbehavior to maximize quarterly profits. Over the short term, you could\nboost quarterly profit by firing your research and development (R & D)\nstaff. The company would make big profits for two years and then 20\nbankrupt because it has nothing new to’'sell.\n\nc Instead, maybe you should count the number of new patents issued, but\ndown that road lies excessive investment in research and not enough\ninvestment in making salable products.\n\nSeveral different numbers seem informative about the business’s status, but\nany of them, considered in isolation, is prone to damaging side effects. A key\npoint of measurement is to encourage people to do better on the measured\nscores, and so people who want to do a good job will try to find ways to\nbring up the score. Their methods might not be the ones that the metric\ndesigner had in mind. For example, laying off research staff to boost short:\nterm profits might not be within the expectation of the person pushing to\nimprove quarterly profits. But it might be a good faith response to the\ndemand to increase this number.\n\nA possible solution to the problem of measurement side effects is to use\nseveral numbers that have counterbalancing side effects. For example, a\n\n*Even this is an oversimplification. As one of our reviewers, Noel Nyman, explained, “This impli have\ntests have a single unit value, which is probably not true.

You can think of progress (or lack of progress) reporting along\n\nseveral different dimensions, such as\na How much of the product has been tested?\nHow much of the planned testing has been done?\n\nco\nHow many problems have been found, and how many of those are still\n\noutstanding?\n\nHow much confidence do we have in the quality of the testing (for\nexample, we should have low confidence if beta testers are finding glaring\nerrors missed by the testers)?\n\nHow much testing work is being blocked because of unfixed defects or\nmissing equipment or unmade decisions?\n\na |\n\nThe best status reports we have seen use indicators of each of these types.\nThe information they provide to management doesn’t fit into a single, trivial\nnumber. But the pattern of information can be represented simply enough to\nguide decision-making. |\n\n~u, Here's a suggested structure for a weekly\n\nstatus report.\n\nImagine the status report as a four-page document.

Participation in the project may not be practical, but in assigning\npriorities to your own time, you might consider carefully the possibility that\nactive participation in at least one project at a time is important enough to\nmerit a high priority. |\nYou'll lose credibility with your staff if you can’t even install or run the\nsoftware they’re testing.

Many managers routinely try\nOr ery percent or 20 percent of work from each of their staff ro.\ncrater how hard the individual is already working. Don’t let yourself be\nguilt-tripped if you can’t do the impossible, nor if you refuse to burn out\nyourself and your family making the impossible effort.\n\nSoftware development is not always a 9-to-5 job. You should support your\nteam, and sometimes this might require heavy overtime for a few days or\nweeks. Sometimes the project manager will need your help to pull the project\nback on track or to get it finished. By all means, do everything that you\nreasonably can do, if it will help. But choose your own pace and make your\nown commitments. Be a volunteer, not a victim.?\n\nYou don’t have to promise the impossible. You don’t have to lie. You don’t\nhave to cover up problems. In fact, as a tester, the essence of your job is to\nexpose problems and not to cover them up. You don’t have to, and you never\nshould, compromise your integrity.\n\nYour power comes from having the freedom to say what's so, to the people\nwho need to hear it. If you compromise your reputation for integrity, you'll\nweaken one of the core supports of your power.\n\nSome employers are unreasonable and abusive, and you can’t change them.\n\nIf the job is intolerable, get your resume on the street and leave when you\nfind a better job.\n\nsevecacscscsssscesecetoreeeececescc ccc I nO IE aan\nCeCe besa eaten eeeeeeeaaeeeee rere seen teenetuverecececec ccc gagacuas\nMT Ov esac bon ecavavarecbereeaveveraceresnesavenstavepessgsansceraparpaseeeseserareeneeses eens ey een\n\nMany testing groups work chronic overtime.

This situation isn’t what we're talking about\nwhen we refer to abusive overtime. Remember, however, that your staff\nmembers each have different limits. Some have family commitments or other\ncommitments that are not very flexible. Deal graciously with the reality of\nyour situation.\n\nSome companies, or some project managers, chronically short-schedule their\n‘ects and expect their staffs to make up the difference:\n\nproj\n\na Don’t write schedules on the assumption that your staff will spend eight\nhours focused on-task each day. They wont. They can’t. They go to\nmeetings and trainings; they write status reports and memos and fill out\nsilly forms from your company’s HR department. If you're lucky, they\nspend six of eight hours per day focused on their official task, working the\nrest of the time on other things that they have to do.\n\na Don’t agree to schedules you know are impossible. Instead, estimate as\nwell as you can how long different tasks will take. When faced witha\nschedule that is shorter than your task list, ask which ones you should do\nfirst and which ones should be done if you have time left over. If you face\na manager who insists that you do all of them, ask which ones can be\ndone less thoroughly. And, ask for more staff. Sometimes, you'll face an\nunreasonable executive who insists that you agree to do everything\nwithin an impossible time. OK, so maybe you say the words. Remember,\nhowever, that the words aren’t magical. Reality will roll over your project\n\n_ and your staff like a steamroller, no matter what promises you make. In\nthe face of executives who will not listen to reason, manage your people _\nsensibly, or you'll lose them.\n\nAnother cause of chronic overtime is the manager who rewards people for\nbeing onsite (“at work”). Someone who is “at work” 80 hours per week\n\nmight be seen as more dedicated and more deserving than someone else who\nworks 45 hours a week but gets more and better work done. Your challenge is\nto find a way to make the results of the more efficient employee visible. We\ncan’t tell you in a book how to do this. The things we've done that were\nsuccessful were specific to the individuals (managers and staff).\n\nTwo other types of executives will pose overtime-related management |\nchallenges for you. One type believes that software scheduling is impossible,\nthat all schedules will slip, and so the best thing to do is to ask for whatever\nshe wants and push everyone as hard as possible. The other type seems to\nclieve that he demonstrates his value to the company by cajoling staff to |\nWork as much overtime as possible. We've run into both types.

Imagine testing a compiler—to create\ninteresting tests, you have to be able to write code. In some companies, a\nnonprogramming tester will be treated as a second-class employee no matter\nhow good he is. You have to hire programmers in these cases. Your challenge\nwill be to hire programmers who have diverse backgrounds. In our\nexperience, this is not easy, but it is achievable if you work in a good\ncompany, and the industry is not in one of its full-employment boom cycles.\n\nAnother diversity issue bears mention. Occasional articles are published\nabout racism and sexism and ageism in the computer industry, and we've\nseen our share of it. Hiring, training, pay, and promotion preferences that\nresult in groups that are more dominated by white males than they need to\nbe are particularly counter-productive in testing.

It meant she was better at solving puzzles. These practice effects\nare the basis of the large industry of test preparation for SAT, LSAT, GRE, and\nother standardized college admission tests. Practice effects (previous\nexperience) last quite a long time and are more pronounced in speeded tests.\nThey’re more pronounced in nonverbal tests and performance tests (Jensen\n1980).

The answer is\n\n/ complex. It’s easy to dead-end in testing; you have to manage your career or\n\nyou might go nowhere. The pay is often lower in testing than in other\ndevelopment positions, but it doesn’t have to be if you actively build your\nskills and pick your employers. Turnover is higher; testers seem to get fired,\nlaid off, or driven out more often than other equally competent developers.\nImproving your job-hunting and negotiating skills will be valuable.\n\nThe suggestions that we provide on job-hunting and negotiation are\ndistinctly American, especially Silicon Valley American. If you’re not sure\nwhether our advice applies to your culture, talk with some experienced\n\ncolleagues.\n\nSome testers think they’Il be more attractive job candidates and entitled to\nmore respect if they’re certified and more powerful on the job if they’re\nlicensed. There are plusses and minuses to certification and licensing. We\n\nlook at some of each.\n\nenretaa eahentanne YAM tantra tat At nti Whaniesnsbnhan hatin aN Laight\n\nance remnant Gorn ethno aut Alarm bent t\n\nMOAI enced thee ob rs nina ie\nALLL A BOON AL at AT mnt aa at ned al ts hn tO mle Mie Site\n\nTwo of the common career tracks in testing are technical and managerial.\n\nDro | qusgaswunty HSAs HEE SOS\n\nSome examples of technical jobs within testing (you can 20 from b eginney |\n()\n\nexpert at any of these) are:\n<2 Automation programmer\nAutomation architect\n\nPerformance and scalability tester\n\nSystems analyst\n\nUser interface and human factors analyst and critic\nTest planner\n\nSubject matter expert\n\nBlack box tester\n\nooo 8 8 0 4\n\nSuppose that one of these was your specialty at the end of five years. Our\nimpression is that you would probably have the highest salary and prestige\nand more employment possibilities if you were an excellent automation\narchitect and the next highest as an excellent automation programmer.\nPerformance and scalability pay well at present, too. Our impression is that\nyou would have the lowest salary if you were an excellent black box manual\ntester or (depending on the subject matter) a subject matter expert with more\nknowledge of the subject than of testing techniques.\n\nHere’s an interesting conflict of interest. You can make yourself significantly\nmore valuable to your current employer by learning a sufficiently wide\nrange of testing techniques and supplementing them with domain\nknowledge. You can probably command significantly better pay. However, if\nyou work for a company that shows no loyalty to its staff or you expect to\nchange jobs for some other reason, you'll be better off developing more\nwidely valued skills, even if this is at the expense of your domain knowledge\nand, therefore, of the effectiveness of your testing for this employer. Auseftl\nguiding principle is to identify the skills most needed by your employer (or\nindustry) and acquire them.\n\nSome examples of managerial jobs within testing are:\nTest lead or supervisor\nTest manager\n\nDirector of testing or director of quality\n\nInternal consultant\n\n0 O O @ QO\n\nExternal consultant\n\nYou may find promotion opportunities outside of testing.

These\npositions aren't directly tied to the development or profitability of any —\nproduct. In some companies, therefore, these positions are more vulnerable\n\nto layoffs. Additionally, in some companies, these positions are staffed by\nunderqualified people. We recommend that you gain a thorough grounding\nin mathematical statistics and measurement theory (read and understand\nZuse, 1997 and Austin, 1996) before accepting a position as a metrics -\nspecialist. We recommend that you work in at least two, and preferably three,\nareas (such as testing, programming, and marketing) before taking a position\nas a process improvement specialist. | |\n\n| Py Testers’ incomes can be higher than\nprogrammers’ incomes.\nTraditionally, testers have made less money than comparably experienced\nProgrammers. That’s not true in all companies, and some people say that\ntesters have been gaining on programmers over the past few years.\n\nPay Comparisons are more complex.

We've been through tight software job markets and\nopen ones, booms, and contractions. When the job market is open, and\n\nemployers are desperate, you can make bold moves relatively easily. Even fs\nwhen the job market is tight, however, lots of opportunities are available for ;\n\npeople who prepare themselves.\n\nFor example, if you want to move out of testing into programming, take\n\ncourses. If your schedule at work makes it impossible to take courses at a\n\nuniversity or university extension (sometimes called professional studies)\n\nprogram, take a self-paced course over the Net or study from one of the\n\nbook-and-course-on-CD packages. After you gain basic skill ina relevant\n\nprogramming language, offer to do some work, on your time, for one of the\n\nprogramming teams. You might get some resistance from your test manager.\n\nWe suggest that you find a way to reassure him that you will work 40 hours\n\nper week on testing. Your time beyond the 40 hours should be respected as |\n| your own.

Your goal is to write a resume that appeals to the right\nsubmarket.\n\nci If you're interested in significantly different types of work, write a few\ndifferent resumes. Focus them differently, to highlight the skills, interests,\nand background that put you in the best light. Make sure that your\ndescriptions of your background and achievements are compatible across\nthe various versions of your resume (always assume that your employer\nwill eventually see all of your resumes).\n\nm Prepare a historical resume. A historical resume describes your experience\nin chronological order, from job to job, highlighting your achievements at\neach job. Some recruiters (and a few employers) prefer functional\nresumes, which describe your experience from skill to skill, mentioning\nthe company at which you developed the skill as a detail item. There’s\nnothing wrong with functional resumes, but they’re used by some people\nto exaggerate their experience or to hide periods of unemployment. As a\nresult, some hiring managers (us, for example) insist on developing a\nhistorical profile of job candidates. If you don’t have it in writing, we go\nthrough the tedium of asking for the details over the phone or in the face-\nto-face interview. If you have it in writing, then during a phone interview\nthat focuses on your history, offer to fax the manager a chronological\nversion of your resume. Some managers will be strongly impressed by\nyour preparation and thoughtfulness. Some hiring managers will ignore\njob candidates who only supply function resumes, unless the candidates’\nskills are an exceptional fit for the job and their claims are credible.\n\n= Prepare a functional or buzzword resume. Some companies scan resumes\ninto computers or have resumes reviewed quickly by people who don’t\nunderstand the position that you’re applying for. If you want to work for\none of those companies, you have to put the right buzz words or phrases\ninto the resume. Functional resumes are good for this. Alternatively, in a\nhistorical resume, consider adding a section titled “Key Words: For\nComputerized Searches” and then list every programming language\napplication, significant skill, and so on in one paragraph. Just name the\nNames, explain nothing.\n\n2B keegan PerN ED i nN Sor VES ify SUE -\n\nrm Never exaggerate your background, slall, or experience. Your cre dibiline\none of your major assets. If anyone strongly suspects that you exaggerated\nor lied on your resume, you won't be hired. People will also see your °\nresume even after you are. Two years after you've been on the job, a\nmanager from another group (or a new manager of yours) might review\nyour resume and see that you claimed expertise in something that you\nclearly don’t know. This manager might not talk with you about thi s, but\nhe’ll probably talk with other managers. It won’t help your career,\n\n- Get an inside referral.\n\nMany companies give bonuses to their employees for referring candidates\nwho get hired. Take advantage of this. Use a current employee of your target\ncompany to refer you. That way you'll also have a way to get information\nabout the company from the inside and probably a way to get valuable\nfeedback during the interview and negotiation process. It’s worked for us.\n\n, Research salary data.\n\nIt’s easy to get realistic salary expectations from databases like\nwww.salary.com. Know this information and walk into the interview\nprepared.\n\nIf you're answering an advertisement,\n. tailor your answer to the advertisement.\n\nIf an advertisement lists several requirements, respond to them.

So don’t. But when you see a particularly\ninteresting position, you can do a huge amount of research on the Internet for\nfree and a bunch more for a few extra dollars. Go to the company’s Web site,\nread their stuff, download any demo software they provide, and look for\ninformation about the programming tools they use. Use search engines. If it’s\npublicly held, go to sites that give investor information and ask questions.\nThe more you know, the more tailored you can make your cover letter.\n\nAs soon as you learn that a company (that you’re interested in) is interested\nin you, you should research the company. The more you know, the more\neffective you'll be in your discussions with them.\n\nIf someone does call you for an interview over the phone, ask for\n\ninformation.\nature that describes the company.\n\nare they publish or ask what tools\nare and what types of applications\n\n© Ask for product literature or liter\n= Ask for demonstration copies of softw\nthey use to develop and test their softw\nthey create.\n\n(Ask where to find other information about the company.\n\nIf they send you anything, make sure to read it before your face-to-face\nenn heir company and\nInterviewers want to know whether you want f wore eae for the job and\nwhy.

Here\nare some examples of questions that often yield interesting answers:\n\nm What kinds of products and services does your company provide?\nc: Can I see a demonstration of the key product?\n\nc= What is special about your products and services?

If you're employed\nyour easiest alternative is to keep your current job and wait until a better ong\nhe key reason that people who have a job find it easie; to\n\nshows up. This is t 3\nget good jobs than people who don't. People who are unemployed rarely\n\nhave as credible and obvious an alternative as someone with a job. They're\noften desperate, and even if they aren’t, they’re seen as people who need a\njob soon or they'll run out of savings (and become desperate). As a result,\ncompanies often feel that they can offer less money and make fewer othe;\npromises to someone who doesn’t have a job. If you’re unemployed, don’t\nslow down your job search when you make contact witha good-looking\ncompany. Speed it up. Find another good-looking company. Whether or not\nyou let each company know about the other (be careful about naming one\ncompany to the other, some people feel this is a breach of confidentiality),\nyou will negotiate differently because you will know that you have\nalternatives. The confidence this gives you will affect how you present\n\nyourself.\n\nHere are some issues to raise and consider during negotiation:\n\nmi Early in the interview, talk about what you want (nonmonetary issues)\nand what excites you. If they’re excited about your interests, they'll run\nthe interviews (and the rest of the negotiations) in a way that is more\nintended to persuade you to join the company.\n\nm Refuse to provide previous salary information. Politely reject queries\nabout your salary expectations until after the employer is excited about\nyou. It often helps to explain that your last salary is irrelevant to this\nposition because it was for a different position. What you want is a fair\nrate for this job. Then ask what the pay scale is for this job. Some\ninterviewers will tell you. Others will refuse, and then you get to say, —\n“Let's talk about the money later, after we understand the responsibilities\nand the opportunities.”\n\n= Be enthusiastic but don’t be over-eager.\n\nO\n\nSpeak about their product in their vocabulary.\n\n3 Find and point out ways in which you can help them.

My FOS Ww\nPhe Quality Assurance Institute offers certifications in software testing\n\nsoftware quality. The British Computer Society is developing anew\n\ncertification scheme for testers. You can get certified by other groups as well\n\nOur impression is that the certification exams aren’t all that difficult to pass\nThe questions are often fairly predictable, If you take an exam-focused |\nreview course, you'll probably pass the exam. Some SToups post sample\nuestions on the Net from time to time. From what we've seen, exams are\ntypically multiple-choice and sometimes open-book, They often test your\nknowledge of vocabulary and of relatively simple concepts and basic skills\nThe fact that someone is certified doesn’t mean that he’s an expert. |\n\nMany of the people who get certified do so after taking a series of courses,\nnot just the review course. They use preparation for certification as an\nopportunity to extend their education. In our experience, these people value\ntheir certification and feel that they gained a lot from the process.\n\nCertification can be useful on a resume. It tells your prospective employer\nthat you’re serious enough about the field to take enough continuing\neducation to be able to pass a certification exam. This differentiates you from\nmost of the rest of the people applying for any testing job. However, if you’re\ncertified (but a nonprogrammer) and someone else isn’t certified but can\nprogram, don’t be surprised if you’re not the one who gets the test\nautomation job. Your certification can carry you only so far.\n\nOn balance, we think the software testing and software quality certification\nefforts have been beneficial to the profession. They’ve encouraged many\npeople to study classic books and papers in the field, learn new techniques,\nand increase their sophistication in dealing with software quality-related\nissues,\n\nWe are not endorsing the bodies of knowledge or the perspectives of the\ncertifiers.

The first milestone is\noften the yellow belt, which your instructor will give you when she thinks\nyou're finally more of a danger to others than to yourself. Even this usually\ntakes a lot longer than two weeks.\n\nMaybe a discipline is so simple that you can master it in two weeks; if so, by\nall means, take your black belt. But don’t get into any fights.\n\n3 A warning about the efforts to license\nsoftware engineers.\n\nShould software engineers (including testers) be licensed? Other kinds of\nengineers are licensed, maybe we should, too.\n\nA license to practice engineering is granted by the government. In the United\nStates, you get licensed by state governments, so if you practice in two states,\nyou get two licenses. Licensed professionals are expected to live up toa code\nof ethics and can be sued for malpractice.\n\nEfforts are underway to require that software engineers be licensed. These\nefforts are succeeding in Texas, British Columbia, and Ontario.

In our view, many of the normative\nstatements in SWEBOK do not describe what a reasonable engineer would do\nin a specified situation.\n\nWe think it’s dangerous to treat SWEBOK as though it were a consensus\ndocument. If SWEBOK is taken as describing the standard of care and\nknowledge of the profession, what happens to the software engineer on the\nfailing project who did not follow the approaches recommended in\nSWEBOK?

Our expectation is that the malpractice\n“edicts will be randomly related to the quality of decision-making by the\n\nin question.\n\nand tha\n\nengineers\nCourts in the United States have consistently refused to entertain lawsuits for\ncomput er-related malpractice because software development and software\n3 ngineering aren t professions, and you cannot sue someone for professional\nnegligence (malpractice) if they aren’t a member of a profession (Kaner\n1996a). (A few court decisions have been made since 1996, but they confirm\nKaner’s summary. For example, the most recent court decision on computer-\nrelated malpractice is Heidtman Steel Products, Inc. v. Compuware Corp., 1999.\nThis decision rejected a malpractice lawsuit and provided an extensive list of\nrevious rejections.) Until we have broad and genuine agreement in the field\non the skills and decision-making processes that lead to appropriate choices\nof practices, we think it would be reckless to declare the field a profession\nand to throw the membership of the field to the mercy of the malpractice-law\n\nlegal system.\n\nBy the way, professional negligence insurance for software engineers isn’t\nvery expensive today, because you are so unlikely to be successfully sued for\nprofessional negligence. In fields that face significant malpractice litigation,\ninsurance premiums are in the thousands, sometimes in the tens of\nthousands of dollars per year. Many states require licensed professionals to\ncarry malpractice insurance if they practice their profession in that state.\nHow much do you want to have to spend on insurance in order to be\nallowed to practice as an independent contractor or consultant?\n\nOur statements about malpractice are sometimes misinterpreted as efforts to\nprotect engineers who do bad work. We would like to clear that up. We are\npassionate about software quality. We strongly favor laws that hold\ndevelopers, including development companies, accountable for bad work.\nAll three of us have actively opposed the Uniform Computer Information\nTransactions Act because it protects software developers and vendors from\nliability for their defective products. Kaner’s book on software consumer\nProtection, Bad Software, was reviewed by Ralph Nader as “a how-to-book for\nconsumer protection in the Information Age” (Kaner and Pels 1998, back\ncover),\n\nneers because we think that\n\nWe don’t “ner c} f i\nOppos sing of software eng \\ |\nPpose the licensing der the right circumstances,\n\nmalpractice suits are a bad idea in principle. Un\nmalpractice suits are excellent tools for policing the competence of a od\nProfession, Unfortunately, those circumstances don’t apply to software toaay,\nand nothing that we can wish or say will make that problem go away:\n\nWe do favor tighter standards for software. As a very simple example, we\nfavor a disclosure requirement.\n\nA software vendor (developer, publisher, or reseller) should be required to.\ntell the software customer about every defect in the product that is known to\nthe vendor at the time the product is delivered to the customer. The vendor\nshould be responsible to the customer for any losses caused by defects that\n\nwere known about but not disclosed to the customer in a way that a typical\ncustomer of this product could understand.\n\nWe think that this modest requirement would have a significant impact on\nthe quality of products in the marketplace.\n\nWe favor legal standards that are tied to damage and losses caused by the\ndefects of the product and the erroneous (false) claims by the vendor. If you\nimpose accountability for bad results, people will fix their processes to yield\nbetter results. A few years down that road, and we might well achieve\n\ngeneral acceptance on a set of engineering practices. At that time, it would be\nappropriate to rethink the issue of professionalization.\n\nil\n\noa My.\ni ot\n\nA nf rae |.\n- ae OF £ ; * oO a ae | y - (On, a in\n\nhe test plan is the set of ideas that guides your test process.

Here are several]\n\nalternative strategies:\n\n< We will release the product to friendly users after a brief internal review\nto find any truly glaring problems. The friendly users will put the product\ninto service and tell us about any changes they’d like us to make.\n\nWe will define use cases in the form of sequences of user interactions with\nthe product that represent, altogether, all the ways we expect normal\npeople to use the product. We will augment that with stress testing and\nabnormal use testing (invalid data and error conditions). Our top priority\nis finding fundamental deviations from specified behavior, but we’re\n\nalso concerned with ways in which this program might violate user\nexpectations. Reliability is a concern, but we haven’t yet decided how best\nto evaluate that.\n\nc We will perform parallel exploratory testing and automated regression\ntest development and execution. The exploratory testing will be risk-\nbased, and allocated to coverage areas as needed. We'll revisit the\nallocation each week. The automated regression testing will focus on\nvalidating basic functions (capability testing) to provide an early warning\nsystem about major functional failures. We will also be alert to\nopportunities for high-volume random testing.\n\nEach of the preceding is a strategy. Notice that they’re each different. Each\nhas a different emphasis. Each tells a little story about how we're going to\ntest. Good test strategies tell compelling stories that explain and justify the\ntesting to be done. Just as there are many stories that can be told, there are\nmany possible test strategies.\n\nNote that each of the strategies is rather generic.

Use helpers, automation, special testing\nevents (bug finding parties or bug bounties), heuristics, beta testers—\nanything and everything. If you do this well, your bug find rate will look\na lot like the ideal curve in the diagram. Push it high through aggressive\ntesting and keep it high by diversifying and rediversifying your tests until\nyou simply run out of ideas for new and better tests.\n\nIn the final days, test meticulously.

Higher levels are more ome\nmore powerful tests. This can simplify the discussion of test strate ne ex,\nproviding a shorthand for talking about classes of testing. Here’s oy *\nexample of a test level hierarchy:\n\n= Level 0, Smoke Testing. Simple tests that show the product is ready for\nindependent testing; a sanity check. If level 0 tests fail, send it back to the\nprogrammers.\n\nc Level 1, Capability Testing. Tests that verify the capability of each function\nof the product. The goal is to make sure each function is capable of\nperforming its task. Convoluted scenarios, challenging data, and function\ninteractions are avoided at this level.\n\n= Level 2, Function Testing. Tests that examine both the capability and basic\nreliability of each individual function and subfunction of the product.\nData coverage and complex test result evaluation methods are of interest.\nUse boundary, stress, and error handling tests; avoid convoluted scenarios\nand function interactions.\n\nat involve interactions and flow of control\n\nlex scenarios.

The concept 1s simple: If you know something\nabout how the product works on the inside, you can test 1t better from the\noutside. This is not to be confused with white box testing, which attempts to\ncover the internals of the product in detail. In gray box mode, you are testing\nfrom the outside of the product, just as you do with black box, but your\ntesting choices are informed by your knowledge of how the underlying\ncomponents operate and interact.\n\nGray box testing is especially important with Web and Internet applications,\nbecause the Internet is built around loosely integrated components that\nconnect via relatively well-defined interfaces. Unless you understand the\narchitecture of the Net, your testing will be skin deep. Hung Nguyen’s\nTesting Applications on the Web (2000) is a good example of gray box test\nstrategy applied to the Web.\n\nms, Beware of ancestor worship when reusing\nYo, test materials.\n\nCUP ETT OMT RTO eHeH ene Te Eee Rees TaTerevereEneeeeavaNnreveretee wae eee eeemasenereee\nwoes awe .\neen VOTRE Meee Here Tae Ee eT Ree erate LOU eE DERE SEU d Tee H EEO EA ORI T ESTE THEE OTD ETE\n\nWhen reusing a test or any test material, don’t treat it as a black box.

Don’t worry about people overlapping on the same test tasks or\ntesting the same product in the same way. Duplicated test effort is not the\nsame thing as duplicated tests. Two testers testing the same thing have a fair\nlikelihood of finding different problems. That’s because the testers are\nprobably not running the same tests. Even when they think they are running\nthe same tests, there is bound to be some variation between them. Besides,\none tester may notice a problem that another tester overlooked. It’s very\n\ncommon.\n\nDuplicated test effort is almost never a waste.

Here are some project-based strategic principles:\n\n| Don't lose bugs in the cracks between testers. Unless you apply diverse half-\nmeasures or overlapping testing assignments, you face a real risk of not\ntesting something because it lies on the boundary between the\nassignments of two testers (or teams).\n\n7 Frequently test what you're asked to test. You're testing on behalf of many\nclients. What do they think you should test? Find out and make sure\nyou're doing at least some of it.\n\na Occasionally test what you're asked not to test. Sometimes you're asked not to\ntest certain parts of the product. This can be a delicate matter, and we\ncan’t tell you what to do. However, sometimes the things you’re asked not\n{0 test are the things that need it most.\n\n\"Test the confusion and conflict. Like coder; like code. Wherever there is\nConfusion and conflict, bugs will thrive. If the programmer seems not\nquite sure what a feature is supposed to do, test it. If he’s new to the\n\na -s are building units inte\nIf two programmers are b g s that in terface\n\ntechnology, he interface. You won’t be disappointed.\n\nwith each other, test ¢\nDon’t beat a dead feature. When it’s clear that a feature seems full of bugs\ndon’t continue to test it unless you check in with the developer. It May be\na bad build or a bad configuration. Also, ifa component is sO ba dl that ie\ngoing to be replaced rather than revised, any bugs you find will be\nsummarily closed, so don’t bother testing.\n\nMore change means more testing. Theoretically, the tiniest change in the\nproduct can create large and nonlocal effects. That means any change can\npotentially invalidate all the testing you've ever done on the product, In\nreality, most changes have a fairly localized effect. However, it is Certainly\ntrue that you must follow the changes with your testing. The more change\nin the product, the more testing you must do. This becomes a big deal in\n\nthe end game of a project.\n\n256 Treat test cycles as the heartbeat oi the\ntest Process.\n\nee ee rarer rrr rrr rrrerrrrrerrryrrerrrrrr rt Srer ri rrririrritiriviririrtiiriiti iri eee eee eee rere re eer\n\nYou provide your testing in cycles.

Plan\nyour test cycles to get the best information to your clients as soon as you\npossibly can. Here’s one way to organize a test cycle:\n\n1. Recetve the product. Make sure you get the right build.\n\n2. Configure your test system. Clean your test system. Restore the disk image\n\nto a pristine state or completely uninstall the previous version of the\nproduct.\n\n3. Verify testability. Is this a good build? Is it worth your time to test? Start by\n\nrunning smoke tests: simple tests that demonstrate that each major\nfunction is present and basically operational.\n\n4. Determine what is new or changed. What new code has been written that\nextends or modifies the capabilities of the product?\n\n5. Determine what bugs have been fixed. Also look for problems that have been\nrejected and respond accordingly. .\n\n6. Test fixes. Test fixes first while they’re still fresh in the minds of the\n\nprogrammers.

Along with the book, we have created a web site, context-\ndriven-testing.com, to further the development of the school.\n\nIf you read the principles and illustrations below and decide that you want to\nidentify yourself as part of the school, visit context-driven-testing.com and\njoin the community.\n\nthe Seven Basic Principles of the\nSontext-Drivem Schoo) mmm\n1. The value of any practice depends on its context.\n2. There are good practices in context, but there are no best practices.\n3. P eople, working together, are the most important part of any project's\n\ncontext,\n\n*. Projects unfold over time in ways that are often not predictable.\n\n5, The product is a solution. If the problem isn’t solved, the product doesn’t\nwork.\n6. Good s\n\n7. Only through judgment and s\nentire project, are we able to d\neffectively test our products.\n\noftware testing is a challenging intellectual process.\n\nkill, exercised cooperatively throughout the\no the right things at the right times to\n\nne\nfee eres\nTOO Ces esany\n\nPOTPTTT TTT\nane nen enon ranean ener en eae arenes anes esesy\npenanenencacceenenan\nnen ececmce nner ere nen eaeaenyane\n\nTesting groups exist to provide testing-related services. They do not run\n\nthe development project; they serve the project.\n\nc Testing is done on behalf of stakeholders in the service of developing,\nqualifying, debugging, investigating, or selling a product. Entirely\ndifferent testing strategies could be appropriate for these different\nobjectives.\n\n© Itis entirely proper for different test groups to have different missions. A\n\ncore practice in the service of one mission might be irrelevant or counter-\n\nproductive in the service of another.\n\nca Metrics that are not valid are dangerous.\n\nc The essential value of any test case lies in its ability to provide\ninformation (i.e., to reduce uncertainty).\n\nrc All oracles are fallible. Even if the product appears to pass your test, it\nmight well have failed it in ways that you (or the automated test program)\nwere not monitoring.\n\nm Automated testing is not automatic manual testing: It’s nonsensical to talk\nabout automated tests as if they were automated human testing.\n\nm Different types of defects will be revealed by different types of tests—tests\nshould become more challenging or should focus on different risks as the\nprogram becomes more stable.\n\nr1 Test artifacts are worthwhile to the degree that they satisfy their\nstakeholders’ relevant requirements.\n\nAn Example\n\nCee rere eee e reer etcenvereeeseeeaserereenes ence cg gc gener ene\nTARO EA Terese eee eee sere ee eee eae E neue ETE OAT Se ETLS SEES OEE ER ELSE EEE oe oeee roo oocce ccc gaa genenes\nTOPE eee eu ster eter ee eee net eres eeee nee ees en eT rete e ass eneseneveeesererestareredaneesenereeeseee rns\n\nvonider two projects.

Here are just a few:\n\nLesson 1: Don’t drink straight from the bottle. If you have no glass, nor any\nother possible containers available, pour a tiny amount of port into the\npalm of your hand and sip from there. The port aroma should be smelled\nas you sip. Let the port swirl over your tongue. Don’t gulp down the port.\n\nLesson 2: Don’t drink the entire bottle. If you are drinking because you are\nthirsty, put down the port and drink a big glass of water. A small amount\nof port each time maximizes the enjoyment of the entire bottle. |\n\nLesson 3: Don’t pollute the port.

Remember, they have a bottle\nsomewhere, too.\n\nYou are not holding a bottle of port in your hands. You are holding Lessons\nLearned in Software Testing, a very valuable book about software testing.

Bring your own vessel to the\nreading of this book. That is, bring all of your experiences in software\ndevelopment and testing. If you have never participated in a serious\nsoftware effort, this book will be too heady for you. It will leave you\nconfused and unable to operate heavy machinery for some time. If you are\nexperienced, savor the book’s contents in the context of your own projects.\n\nLesson 2. Don’t drink the entire bottle. Don’t read this book in one sitting.\nRead a lesson or two, close the book, and decide how you respond to the.\nwords of Messrs. Kaner, Bach, and Pettichord. As you will discover, they\ncall their approach to testing “context-driven.” Only you know the context\nof your own work. You must determine where there is a fit between a\ngiven lesson and your particular work.\n\nLesson 3. Don’t pollute the port. Somebody out there is going to make a list\nof the titles of the 293 lessons contained in this book. Please don’t let it be\nyou. The heart of the book is the explanation attached to each of the\nlessons. Be warned as well that someone else will immediately try to ISO-\nify or CMM-ummify the contents. I can see the article title now, “Getting\nto CMM Level 293 using the 293 Lessons of Lessons Learned in Software\nTesting.” Argh! As the authors explain, ” ... we don’t believe in ‘Dest\npractices.’ We believe some practices are more useful than others under\nsome circumstances.” Written by pros, those statements represent the\nquintessence of attaining the state of Master-crafter of Software Testing.\n\nLesson 4. Don’t covet the port. If there ever is a book to be read with your\ncolleagues, this is it. Buy a carton-load and hand a copy out to everyone\nwho tests and to everyone who thinks that she or he manages testers.

We’ve had\na combined total of 50 to 60 years of development experience (depending on\nhow you count). We’ve been at this for a while. We’ve seen a lot of great work\nand a lot of not-so-great work.\n\nThis book is not about how software engineering might be in a tidier and\nmore controlled world. We're writing about the world as we’ve worked in it.\n\nIn our world, software development teams often work under ambitious\ndeadlines, discovering what needs to be done at the same time as they’re\ndiscovering how to do it. Sometimes their approaches are more formal,\nsometimes less. It depends on a wide range of circumstances.\n\nWe follow the context-driven approach in software testing. We expect that a\nmethod that works wonderfully under some circumstances will not work\nunder others. Rather than talk about best practices, we talk about practices\nthat are well-suited to the context at hand. We discuss the context-driven\napproach at the end of the book, but in essence, context-driven testing looks\nat the “what” of testing (the techniques, tools, strategies, and so on) in terms\nof “who,” “when,” “where,” “why,” and “what if.” _\n\nOur goal is to match our selection of practices to the circumstances at hand in\na way that achieves excellent testing. We don’t expect to achieve great testing\nby taking over the project, nor by stamping our feet and telling the project\nmanager (or executives) how Real Professionals would run the project. We\ndon’t expect to achieve great testing by intimidating programmers, nor by\nbeing obsequious to them. We don’t expect to do great testing by filling out\nthousands of little pieces of paper (or comparable electronic records), nor by\nwasting everyone else’s time on unnecessary processes.\n\nWe don’t have a political or a bureaucratic or a formal-methods recipe for\ngreat testing.\n\nThat recipe doesn’t exist!",

There’s an infinite amount of testing\nto do, and a tiny amount of time in which to do just a little bit of that infinity.\nEvery test we do, every document we write, every meeting we attend takes\ntime away from running other tests that could expose a key defect. Facing\nthat constraint, we optimize our testing processes so that they take advantage\nof our ever-growing knowledge of the product, its market, its applications,\nand its weaknesses.

In\nparticular, as we discover errors, we learn how this group of programmers\ncan go wrong. The specifications tell us about how the program is supposed\nto work when it is coded correctly. They don’t tell us what mistakes to antici-\npate, nor how to design tests to find them.

(We\n\nwant to stimulate thought, not only agreement.)\n\nNewcomers to testing (and those of you who are just applying for a testing\njob) won’t have as many occasions to feel that you’ve already experienced\nwhat we’re writing about. For you, this book might provide some early\ninsights and warnings, giving you a good taste of what issues testers face.\n\nHint: If you are absolutely new to testing and you are looking for a book to\nstudy from in order to prepare for a job interview, this is the wrong book. If\nthis is the only book available to you, pay your most careful attention to the\nchapters on “Testing Techniques” and “Your Career in Software Testing.” If\nyou have a choice of books, we suggest the first five chapters of Testing\nComputer Software (Kaner et al., 1993).\n\nProgrammers, project managers, and executives who have to work with\ntesters will find this book a useful source of ideas for setting your\nexpectations of the testing group. We hope that it will help you evaluate and\ndiscuss your concerns with the testing group if you disagree with their\npolicies or feel that they are spending their time unwisely.\n\nWhat This Book Is About\n\nTO SRR ORO e CROs eae EON OE Hae E DONE ARO EDC H OOD en Ones euen oer anesensatarunes\n\nOver the years, we’ve learned many useful practices and helpful ways of\nevaluating situations. Our conclusions are based on experience. We\nsummarize much of our experience in this book, in a series of short, readable\n\ndescriptions of a few hundred lessons.\n\nWe adopted several criteria for including a lesson in this book. They are:\n\n= The lesson should be useful or should provide insight.\n\n_& The lesson should pass the 90-minutes-thinking-alone test. A lesson is not\n\nworth including in the book if almost anyone who thought about testing\nfor 90 minutes of undistracted time could come up with it.\n\n= The lesson must be based on our actual experience. At least one of us\n(preferably all three of us) had to have successfully applied the advice we\ngive. At least two of us had to have been burned by attempting to follow a\npractice we criticize. (Note: Sometimes, we come to different conclusions,\nbased on different experiences. Occasionally, you'll see that we choose to\nprovide two viewpoints rather than one. Even if only one view is presented,\nyou cannot assume that all three of us fully agree with it—in the event of\ndisagreement, we are likely, among the three of us, to defer to the one or\ntwo who have the most extensive experience with a given situation.)",

For example, a program will crash when it\nattempts to divide by zero. The fault in this case is in the code that allows\ndivision by zero. The failure is the crash. But you don’t see a failure unless\nthe critical variable in the division has the value zero. That variable, having\na value of zero, is the critical condition that must be met for the failure to\noccur.\n\nA symptom is like a failure but less serious. For example, if the program has a\nmemory leak, it might start slowing down long before it fails with an out-\nof-memory error message. The slowdown is a symptom of an underlying\nproblem (memory shortage) that is not directly visible.\n\nThe word bug is a catch-all term. It could refer to anything wrong with the\nsoftware. Someone reporting a bug might describe a fault, a failure, or a\nlimitation of the program that makes it less valuable to a stakeholder.\n\nIf we define quality as value to some person (Weinberg, 1998, 2.i.),a bug report\n1S a statement that some person considers the product less valuable\nbecause of the thing being described as a bug.",

Because all testing is sampling, and your\nsample can never be complete, exploratory thinking has a role throughout\nthe test project as you seek to maximize the value of testing.\n\nBy exploration, we mean purposeful wandering: navigating through a space\nwith a general mission, but without a prescripted route. Exploration involves\ncontinuous learning and experimenting. There’s a lot of backtracking,\nrepetition, and other processes that look like waste to the untrained eye.\nPerhaps for that reason, the importance of exploration to testing, and for that\nmatter software engineering, is often downplayed and even derided by\nwriters and consultants in our field.\n\nIt’s beyond the scope of this book to prove our assertion about the central\nimportance of exploration. One way you can experience it vividly is to watch\nyourself solve a complicated jigsaw puzzle without looking at the picture on\nthe box or play a game of Twenty Questions or Mastermind. Notice how\nmuch more difficult it would be to succeed in these activities, and how much\nless rewarding, with strictly pre-scripted behavior.\n\nFor a look at how disciplined exploration is used in another field much like\ntesting, sociology, see The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for\nQualitative Research (Glaser and Strauss 1999), and Basics of Qualitative\nResearch, 2nd Edition (Strauss, Anselm, and Corbin 1998). If you like statistics,\ntry Exploratory Data Analysis (Tukey 1977).\n\nExploring is detective work. It’s an open-ended search. Think of exploration\nas moving through a space. It involves forward, backward, and lateral\nthinking:\n\n= Forward thinking. Work from what you know to what you don’t know;\nwhat you see toward what you haven’t yet seen. Seek ramifications and\nside effects. Example: I see a print menu item. I'll click on it and see what\nhappens.\n\n— Backward thinking. Work from what you suspect or imagine back toward\nwhat you know, trying to confirm or refute your conjectures. Example: I\nwonder if there’s a way to print this document? I'll look through the\nmenus and see whether there’s a print item. (Solow 1990)",

The method is based on\nthe premise that a scientist can never be absolutely certain of any particular\nfact or theory about nature. Everything is a conjecture. Some conjectures, like\nthe existence of gravity, are very strong. What makes them conjecture, instead\nof absolutely certain fact, is that it’s possible to imagine new information\nthat, if it existed, would cause us to reject the conjecture. Popper noticed that\nthough we can’t prove that a conjecture is true, it may be possible to prove\nthat it’s false. Therefore, he suggested that the only confidence a given\nconjecture deserves would come from trying hard to refute it and not being\nable to do so.\n\nThis method of making conjectures and trying to refute them applies to\ntesting in three important ways: :\n\n= It’s more powerful to test for the purpose of showing that the product\nfails, than it is to show that it works. When you want to know whether a\nproduct works well, find ways to refute that it works well, and your\ntesting will probably be better.\n\nmc A well-formed belief about the software (how it behaves, how good it is,\nand so on) should be falsifiable. That means we should be able to imagine\nnew information that would contradict our belief. Otherwise, our belief is\nnothing more than faith. Faith is fine in private life but is poisonous for\ntesting.\n\nmr Beware of tests that purport to validate or certify a product in a way that\ngoes beyond the specific tests you ran.

In our opinion, this is a bad practice. It reflects a fundamental\nmisunderstanding of testing and the people who do it well.\n\nWhen evaluating a test process, look first at the quality of the testers on the\nproject. Look at how they think and how that affects what they do. Only then\ncan you be in a position to evaluate the work products they produce.\n\nYou can 't master testing unless you\n~ reinvent it.\n\n- Don’t reinvent the wheel. Wait a minute. Isn’t the wheel the single most\nreinvented thing in history? Isn’t that a good thing? After all, we drive on\npneumatic tires, these days, not granite disks. There are thousands, if not\nmillions of variations on the wheel theme. Maybe that’s a lesson. It seems to\nus there are at least two reasons to reinvent something: to adapt it to anew\ncontext, and to learn how it works. Mastery requires both.\n\nWe have colleagues who advise students of testing to avoid reinventing tests\nor testing ideas. We disagree. That’s like learning a science by avoiding\nexperimentation. It’s okay to learn from other thinkers. We think it’s\nimportant to learn that way—check the title of this book if you doubt that.\nBut if that’s the only way you learn, then you can never become a master of\nthe testing craft. You'll be a technician, nothing more. Following instructions\nwon’t get you to mastery any more than following an interstate highway\nwill get you to Mars. We encourage that you learn testing the way great\nmechanics or great programmers learn: Take things apart, ponder how they\nwork, and put them back together in new ways. Don’t restrict yourself to\nbeing a steward of received wisdom; be the author of your own wisdom.\n\nEarly in your learning process, your reinvented tests, ideas, techniques, or\ndocuments aren’t very good. That’s normal. Just keep your brain turned on,\nwatch other testers, study, and continually evaluate how your ideas pan out.\nIf you want to be good at this, you have to practice.\n\nWe've been at this for years, and we are still reinventing, still reworking old\nideas.

It’s time to get more specific.\nWhere do tests come from? What do tests look like? This chapter is about\ntesting techniques, but we won't define every technique in detail. For that,\nyou'll have to go to the main textbooks on testing. We suggest Kaner, Falk,\nand Nguyen (1993), Jorgensen (1995), Beizer (1990), Marick (1995), Collard\n\n(forthcoming), and Hendrickson (forthcoming).

We placed this in the first\nlesson. The next five lessons list several techniques, but the primary\npurpose of those lists is to support the classification system. We provide\nthis detail to make it easier for you to imagine how to apply the\nclassification system to your work.\nThis classification system synthesizes approaches that we have\nindividually used and taught.

Hence the Addendum, which describes five techniques that we find\nuseful, in ways that have worked well for our students in professional-level\nseminars and university courses on software testing.\n\nOur primary goal in this chapter is to present a classification system for\ntesting techniques.

For example, user testing is focused on\n\ntesting by members of your target market, people who would normally\nuse the product. oe |\n\n= Coverage. What gets tested. For example, in function testing, you test every\nfunction. |\n\n= Potential problems. Why you're testing (what risk you're testing for). For\nexample, testing for extreme value errors.\n\n= Activities. How you test. For example: exploratory testing.\n\nm1 Evaluation. How to tell whether the test passed or failed. For example,\ncomparison to a known good result,\n\nWe also describe a few techniques in detail in this chapter and present\ninsights about the use of a few others, but our primary goal is to explain the\n\nclassification system.\n\nAll testing involves all five dimensions. A testing technique focuses your\nattention on one or a few dimensions, leaving the others open to your\njudgment. You can combine a technique that is focused on one dimension\nwith techniques focused on the other dimensions to achieve the result you\nwant. You might call the result of such a combination a new technique (some\npeople do), but we think the process of thinking is more useful than adding\nanother name to the ever-expanding list of inconsistently defined techniques\nin use in our field.

It’s wise to do function testing before doing more complex tests\nthat involve several functions. In a complex test, the first broken function\nwill probably stop the test and block you from finding, with this test, that\nseveral other functions are also broken.

A domain is a (mathematical) set that includes all possible\nvalues of a variable of a function. In domain testing, you identify the\nfunctions and the variables. The variables might be input or output\nvariables. (The mathematical distinction between input domains and\noutput ranges is not relevant here, because the testing analysis is the same\nfor both cases.) For each variable, you partition its set of possible values\ninto equivalence classes and pick a small number of representatives\n(typically boundary cases) from each class. The assumption of the method\nis that if you test with a few excellent representatives of a class, you'll find\nmost or all of the bugs that could be found by testing every member of the\nclass. Note that in contrast to function testing, the primary element of\ninterest is the variable rather than the function. Many variables are used by\nmore than one function. The domain tester will analyze a variable and\nthen, based on that analysis, run tests that involve this variable on each\nfunction with this variable as an input or an output.\n\nEquivalence class analysis. An equivalence class is a set of values for a\nvariable that you consider equivalent. Test cases are equivalent if you\nbelieve that (a) they all test the same thing; (b) if one of them catches a bug,\nthe others probably will too; and (c) if one of them doesn’t catch a bug, the\nothers probably won’t either. Once you’ve found an equivalence « class, test\nonly one or two of its members.\n\nBoundary testing. An equivalence class is a set of values. If you can map\nthem onto a number line, the boundary values are the smallest and largest\nmembers of the class. In boundary testing, you test these, and you also test\nthe boundary values of nearby classes that are just smaller than the\nsmallest member of the class you're testing and just larger than the largest\nmember of the class you're testing. For example, consider an input field\nthat accepts integer values between 10 and 50. The boundary values of\n\noe ena etree meme ee",

A best representative of an equivalence class is a\nvalue that is at least as likely as any other value in the class to expose an\nerror in the software. In boundary testing, the boundary cases are almost\nalways best representatives. But suppose that you cannot map an\nequivalence class onto a number line. For example, the printers that are\nHewlett-Packard PCL-5 compatible are (or should be) an equivalence class\nbecause they should all work the same way. Now suppose that for a\nspecific task, one of the printers is slightly more likely to have trouble than\nthe others. This printer would be a best representative for that class. If it\ndoesn’t fail, we have some confidence that the other printers also wouldn't.\n\nInput field test catalogs or matrices. For each type of input field, you can\ndevelop a fairly standard set of test cases and reuse it for similar fields in\nthis product and later products. We give an example of this technique later\nin the chapter. (See the How to Create a Test Matrix for an Input Field.)\n\nMap and test all the ways to edit a field. You can often change the value of a\nfield in several ways. For example, you might be able to import data into\nthe field, enter data directly into the field, have the program copya\ncalculated result into the field, have the program copy a recalculated result\ninto the field, and so on. The field has constraints (restrictions or. what\nvalues the field can take). Some constraints will be constant, while others\nwill depend on the values of other fields. For example, if J and K are\nunsigned integers, they’re constrained to the values of 0 through MaxInt.\nThese are constant constraints. They depend on the programming\nlanguage’s definition of unsigned integers. However, suppose that N is\nalso an unsigned integer, that N = J + K, and that N = 5. In this case, J=5\n— K, and J cannot possibly be bigger than 5 (the value of N). This is a\nvariable constraint, whose range of allowable values depends on the value\nof N. To check that J is kept within its allowable range (5 — Kk), you would\ntry changing its value using each way that you can enter data into J.\n\nLogic testing. Variables have relationships in the program. For example, the\nprogram might have a decision rule that says that if PERSON-AGE is\ngreater than 50 and if SMOKER is YES, then OFFER-INSURANCE must be\nNO. The decision rule expresses a logical relationship. Logic testing\nattempts to check every logical relationship in the program. Cause-effect\ngraphing is a technique for designing an extensive set of logic-based tests.\n\nState-based testing. A program moves from state to state. In a given state,\nsome inputs are valid, and others are ignored or rejected. In response to a\nvalid input, the program under test does something that it can do and does",

In state-based testing, you walk\nthe program through a large set of state transitions (state changes) and\ncheck the results carefully, every time.\n\nPath testing. A path includes all of the steps that you took or all of the .\nstatements that the program passed through in order to get to your current *\nstate. Path testing involves testing many paths through the program. You\ncannot test all the paths through a nontrivial program. Therefore, some\ntesters do subpath testing, testing many partial paths. Basis-path testing, for\nexample, involves testing most or all subpaths of a certain type (the basis\npaths), under the assumption that if you get all of these, few tests of longer\npaths would be likely to find bugs that these tests missed.\n\nStatement and branch coverage. You achieve 100 percent statement coverage\nif your tests execute every statement (or line of code) in the program. You\nachieve 100 percent statement and branch coverage if you execute every\nstatement and every branch from one statement to another. Designing your\ntests to achieve a high percentage of line and branch coverage is sometimes\ncalled “Coverage-based testing.” (And after you achieve that, you can quit\ntesting or quit designing additional tests). We call this statement-and-branch\ncoverage to differentiate it from all of the other types of testing that focus on\nsome other type of coverage. Configuration coverage is an excellent\nexample of a technique that hits the same statements many times but with\n\npotentially very different results. There are many, many other examples\n(Kaner 1995a). Testing that is focused on achieving high statement-and-\nbranch coverage numbers will characteristically miss many types of bugs,\nsuch as (but not only) bugs involving missing code, incorrect handling of\nboundary values, timing problems, problems of compatibility with:\nhardware and software configurations, delayed-fuse bugs like wild\n\n_ pointers, memory leaks or stack corruption that eventually leads to stack\noverflow, usability problems, and other failures to meet customer\nrequirements. This technique is much more valuable to identify incomplete\ntesting (what code has not yet been tested), than as a minimum standard\nfor the amount of testing needed. Indeed, it’s dangerous to allow testers to\n\nStop merely because they achieved X percent coverage (Marick 1999).\n\nConfiguration coverage. If you have to test compatibility with 100 printers,\nand you have tested with 10, you have achieved 10 percent printer\ncoverage. More generally, configuration coverage measures the percentage\nof configuration tests that you have run (and the program has passed),\ncompared to the total number of configuration tests that you plan to run.\nWhy do we call this a test technique? Ordinarily, we would just consider this a\nmeasure of how much of a certain type of testing we had achieved.\nHowever, some testers craft a special series of tests that will make high-",

Testing focused on verifying every factual claim\nthat is made about the product in the specification. (A factual claim is any\nstatement that can be shown to be true or false.) This often includes every\nclaim made in the manual, in marketing documents or advertisements, and\nin technical support literature sent to customers.\n\nRequirements-based testing. Testing focused on proving that the program\nsatisfies every requirement ina requirements document (or focused,\nrequirement by requirement, on proving that some of the requirements\nhave not been met.)\n\nCombination testing. Testing two or more variables in combination with\neach other. We discuss this in the Addendum on Techniques later in this\nchapter. Combination testing is important, but many testers don’t study\nenough of it. Most benefits provided by the program are based on the ©\ninteraction of many variables. If you don’t vary them jointly in your tests,\nyou'll miss errors that are triggered by difficult combinations, rather than\ndifficult individual values. .\n\nca Problems-based techniques focus on winy\n\n.

Under this view, risk analysis is done to determine what things\nto test next. Testing is prioritized in terms of the probability that some feature\nof the program will fail and the probable cost of failure, if this feature does\nfail. The greater the probability of an expensive failure, the more important it\nis to test that feature as early and as carefully as possible.\n\nThe other meaning, which is where we’re more focused, is on doing risk\nanalyses for the purpose of finding errors. When we study a feature of a\nproduct, we ask how it can fail. That question breaks down into many\nadditional questions, such as: What would a failure look like? Why should\nthis feature fail—what drivers of risk are likely to have affected this feature?\nWe describe our approach to risk-based testing in the Addendum on\nTechniques.\n\nBoth of these approaches to risk-based testing are also discussed in James\nBach on Risk-Based Testing (1999c).",

A constraint is a limit on what the program can handle.\nFor example, if the program can only handle 32-digit numbers (or less), the\nprogrammer should provide protective routines that detect and reject an\ninput that is outside of the 32-digit constraint. If there is no such\nprotection, the program will fail when it attempts to process input data\n\nthat it cannot process. | |\n\nOutput constraints. The inputs were legal, but they led to output values that\nthe program could not handle. The program might fail when it attempts to\ndisplay, print, or save an output value. , |\n\nComputation constraints. The inputs and the outputs are fine, but in the\ncourse of calculating a value (that will lead to an output), the program\nfails. For example, multiplying two huge numbers together might yield\nsomething that is too huge for the program to cope with. |\n\nStorage (or data) constraints. Inputs, outputs, and calculations are legal, but\nthe operations run the program out of memory or yield data files that are\ntoo enormous to process. | | .\n\nWhittaker (2002) provides detailed suggestions for testing against these\nconstraints. CO a | oe\nHere are a few additional tips for the design of risk-based tests:\n\n= If you do risk-based testing, you must also do comparable nonrisk-based\ntesting to test for the risk that you didn’t know the risks well enough to\nmake the right decisions. : |\n\n= Test for timing issues. Surprisingly, many American-educated testers fail\nto consider timing issues. Some classic timing issues include race\nconditions and other unexpected orderings of events that happen in time.\n\nri When you create a test, always create a test procedure that will force the\n\nprogram to use the test data that you have entered, allowing you to\ndetermine whether it’s using that data incorrectly.\n\n(es, Activity-based techniques focus on how\n2. you test. |\n\nPPT e eta eee eee eee eE TAC eee eEE CeCe EET Eee EET Ere E eT ee Lee LCE SRE E EET AT CEE TESST LEL EESTI AUST SON OEE A DELETE TES EDI TE TE SESE U ECE ENEEECtaeatans\nPOCO eae e ere erenererenaeetaweenseneereeneDeees\nere .\n\nRegression testing.

The goal of old bugs\nregression is to prove that a change to the software has caused an old bug fix\nto become unfixed. Side-effect regression, also called stability regression\ninvolves retesting of substantial parts of the product. The goal is to prove\nthat the change has caused something that used to work to now be broken.\n\nScripted testing. Manual testing, typically done by a junior tester who\nfollows a step-by-step procedure written by a more senior tester.\n\nSmoke testing. This type of side-effect regression testing is done with the\ngoal of proving that a new build is not worth testing. Smoke tests are often\nautomated and standardized from one build to the next. They test things\nyou expect to work, and if they don’t, you'll suspect that the program was\nbuilt with the wrong file or that something basic is broken.\n\n_ Exploratory testing. We expect the tester to learn, throughout the project,\nabout the product, its market, its risks, and the ways in which it has failed\nprevious tests. New tests are constantly created and used. They’re more\npowerful than older tests because they're based on the tester’s\ncontinuously increasing knowledge. _ :\n\nGuerilla testing. A fast and vicious attack on the program. A form of\nexploratory testing that is usually time-boxed and done by an experienced\nexploratory tester. For example, a senior tester might spend a day testing\nan area that will otherwise be ignored. She tries out her most powerful\nattacks. If she finds significant problems, the area will be rebudgeted, and\nthe overall test plan might be affected. If she finds no significant problems,\nthe area will hereinafter be ignored or only lightly tested.\n\nScenario testing. A scenario test (as we use the term) normally involves four\nattributes. (1) The test must be realistic. It should reflect something that\ncustomers would actually do. (2) The test should be complex, involving\nseveral features, ina way that should be challenging to the program. (3) It\nshould be easy and quick to tell whether the program passed or failed the\ntest. (4) A stakeholder is likely to argue vigorously that the program should\nbe fixed if it fails this test. A test with these four attributes will be persuasive\nand will probably yield bug fixes if it fails the program. However, you\nmight have to spend days developing an excellent scenario test.\n\nScenario testing. Tests derived from use cases are also called scenario tests\n(Jacobson 1992, Collard 1999) or use case flow tests. (Many people would\nclassify these as coverage-based tests, focusing on coverage of the\nimportant use cases.) |\n\nInstallation testing.

An attacker could attempt to deny service by creating too many\nconnections or users or by using too much memory (have every user issue\na memory-intensive command at the same time) or by using tasks that eat\ntoo much processing capacity. You could do different load tests for each of\n\nthese types of risk.\n\nNow consider an activity perspective:\n\n= Usea tool to track the patterns of activities of your customers. Which\ncommands do customers use most often? What tasks are customers most\nlikely to attempt? What percentage of customers do which activities?\nWhen you have a model of the usage patterns at your site, get a load test\ntool and program it with scenarios that look like each of the types of use.\nHave that tool randomly select among scenarios—in effect, create\ndifferent sessions that represent different types of users. Keep adding\nsessions and watch how performance and reliability of the system\ndegrades with increased load. Make changes to the software as\nappropriate.\n\nWhen you think in terms of the risk, you think of a weakness that the\n\nprogram might have and ask how to design a test series that would expose\n\nthat kind of weakness. When you know what type of test you want to run,\n\nthink about the way that you'll run that test. If you were testing a telephone\n\nsystem, you might need a tool, or you might be as well off with 10 friends\n\nwho make a bunch of phone calls. The criterion for the test design is that it\n\nmust have power—the ability to detect the fault that you're looking for.\n\nIn contrast, when you think in terms of activities, you're asking how to do\nload testing. What tools? What will the tools do? And so on. The expectation\nis that if you use the tools competently, model customers accurately, and do\nthe other activities associated with good load testing, then you'll probably\nfind the types of bugs that load testing is likely to reveal.\n\nEither classification is accurate, but the classification itself only helps you so\nmuch.

The first\ncritical problem of combination testing is the number of test cases. Imagine\ntesting three variables together, when each variable has 100 possible values.\nThe number of possible tests of Variable 1 with Variable 2 with Variable 3 is\n\n- 100 x 100 X 100 = 1,000,000 test cases. Reducing the number of tests is a\ncritical priority. — a SO |\n\nStart with Domain Partitioning | |\nThe first step is to reduce the number of values that will be testedin each\nvariable. The most common approach involves domain testing. Partition the\nvalues of Variable 1 into subdomains and choose best representatives of the\nsubdomains. Perhaps you can bring the number of tests of Variable 1 down\n_ to five this way. If you can do:the same for Variable 2 and Variable 3, you\n_ now only have 5 x 5 x 5 tests (125). This is still too many for practical\npurposes, but it’s a lot less than a million. Be |\n_ The best discussions in print of partitioning are in Ostrand and Balcer (1988)\n_. and Jorgensen (1995). Jorgensen provides good examples of partitioning and\nof testing several partitioned variables in combination. We present a different\napproach to combinations from his, which we have found useful. |\n\nAchieving All Singles\n\n; The simplest set of combination tests would ensure that you cover every\nvalue of interest (every one of the five that we'll test) of every variable. This is\n_ called all singles (in contrast to all pairs and all triples) because you’re making\n\nsure that you hit every single value of every variable. You can achieve this as\nfollows: | oe :\n\nae Let V1, V2, and V3 stand for the three variables.\n\n2. Let A, B,C, D, and E be the five values of interest in variable V1.

For\nexample, you might explain how the bug interferes with normal use of the\nproduct, what data it corrupts, or how often people will run into it. You\nmight point to a magazine review or other published complaint that\nsavaged a competitor for a bug similar to this one. You might quote\ntechnical support statistics to show that bugs like this one in other\nproducts have cost a lot of money. You might show that the program\npassed this test in a previous release. (This is a key issue in some\ncompanies.) Or you might make sure that the report is drawn to the\nattention of someone whose pet feature is interfered with by this bug. In\nmany cases (see the following), you can take a relatively minor-looking ©\nbug and discover more severe consequences by doing follow-up testing,\nrather than reporting the first version of the bug that you see.\n\nAnticipate objections to the sale and counter them.

In some companies, the full\nChange Control Board reviews the bug to decide what to do with it. In_\nothers, the bug goes to the Change Control Board only after the programmer\nor project manager decides not to fix the bug. That's a lot of readers.

Late in the\nproject, if you flood the company with minor bug reports, you might single-\nhandedly kill the productivity of the programming and project management\nteams. You may elicit a surprising amount of resentment or anger by\nreporting very minor problems or by writing unclear (unnecessarily time-\nconsuming) reports later in the project.\n\nWhen you report a minor bug, take special care to make your report clear,\nand well analyzed (see the points on follow-up testing later in this chapter). If\nyou're about to report a collection of minor bugs late in the schedule, talk\nwith your test manager about group policy. Perhaps you should report the\nbugs into a secondary database that will be formally reviewed as input to the\nnext release but that will be ignored in this release.

For\nexample, perhaps the programmer can revise the program so that it doesn't\nmake the critical system call and, therefore, won't cause the system crash.\nThis is partially an O/S bug, but because the failure can be prevented at\nthe application level, it is also an application bug.

One of the\nmost important reasons involves risk. Every bug fix (and every other change\nto the code) can create new bugs. When the programmer fixes a minor bug,\nhe might create a more serious one. If he does this near the end of the\nschedule, you might not have enough testing time between his change and\nthe release date to find the bigger problem. The fear of undiscovered side-\neffects makes experienced project managers cautious about making late\nchanges to the code.\n\nAnother excellent reason is that the customer might not be willing to pay for\nthe fix. This is particularly apparent in the cases of custom, contract software\nand of in-house development. The customer is actually paying for your time.\nSome bugs are less expensive to deal with than the cost of their repair. But\neven remote customers have value tradeoffs. Imagine working on an update\nrelease that will fix a critical error that erases some customers’ data. The\nprogram with the bug is in use, in the field. Now imagine delaying that\nupdate release so that a spelling mistake can be fixed. The answer in the case\nof this update release seems obvious (don’t fix the spelling mistake). For less\nobvious decisions, the project team is responsible for imagining and\nevaluating the tradeoffs, in order to reach the right balance of time, cost,\nfeature availability, and reliability.\n\nIf you cannot build a case that a bug is important or find a stakeholder who\ncares enough to actively support your appeal of that particular deferral, we\nsuggest that you leave that bug alone and challenge something else.\n\nDeferred means that the bug you reported is real, but it’s not going to be fixed\nin this release. Therefore, bugs that were closed as deferred in this release are\nopen issues at the start of the next release. Many groups set up their bug-\ntracking systems to automatically reopen the old deferred bugs or to transfer\nthem (as open bugs) into the new file for the next version product. They often\nalso reopen bugs that were rejected as “works as designed,” if the relevant\ndesign decisions are under review in the new release.\n\nProducts that pass through many releases pick up a collection of annoying\nbug reports that will never result in code changes or documentation\nimprovements. Some groups do a review with project managers and\npermanently close some bugs as INWTSTA (“I never want to see this again”).",

The phrase “smoke test” comes from hardware\ntesting. You plug in a new board and turn on the power. If you see smoke\ncoming from the board, turn off the power. You don’t have to do any more\ntesting. Smoke tests (a.k.a. build verification tests) broadly cover product\nfeatures in a limited time—typically over lunch or overnight.

These are\n\nlarger sets of tests that focus on testing the low-level functions and classes\nof your product. |\n\nThe greatest value of automated smoke and unit tests is that they can be run\nat any time and by any one. Run them automatically as part of the build\nprocess. Their availability helps individual programmers create minibuilds\nthat incorporate just one or a few of their changes. If one of those builds is\nbroken, the programmer knows what to investigate. If the minibuilds are OK,\nthe broader build that comes to you, which collects everyone’s changes, is\n\nmore likely to work. This is an invaluable benefit that your project manager\nis sure to appreciate. | | |\n\nThese kinds of automated tests take time, effort, skill, and money to create.\nThe unit tests will probably be created by the programmers, although you\nmight encourage and speed that effort by writing the code with them as half\nofa programming pair.

Automators sometimes code different test\nprocedures from the ones they specified. Long ago, they may have had»\ngood reasons for this, or they may have been confused. How would you\nknow? How easy is it to review the tests and read the code?\n\nTests may no longer be interesting. Reviewer Douglas Hoffman reports, “I\nrecently discovered an automated memory test in use at a computer\nmanufacturer which they called a ‘lonely bit test.’ It was a test used to find\ncertain wiring errors in pre-1970s core memory. The biggest core memories\nwere 16 Kb, and the tests took minutes to run. They now can take hours to\nrun on large memory configurations. The error it looks for isn’t possible in\ncurrent memory systems. Another automated test I recently reviewed was\ndesigned to test a state machine of an embedded processor system. ] saw\nthat the documentation on the test was written in 1986, seven product\ngenerations earlier. And, no, no one had thought to update the tests when\nthe state machines were changed each generation.”\n\nCoverage may be poor. People often focus on the number of tests in a test\nsuite. It’s easy to inflate the size of a test suite by adding lots of minor\nvariations of the same test. Check the actual coverage of the test suite. You\nmay be surprised at what isn’t tested.\n\nFalse alarms may be common.

GUI test tools support various techniques for identifying\nwindow controls, such as internal names, various properties, adjacent\nlabels, and ordinal position. Rather than embedding the identification\ntechnique in every reference to a control, use window maps to associate a\nname to the identification technique for a control. If a user interface change\nforces you to change the technique particulars, you need only update the\nwindow map. Some test tools include support for creating and using\nwindow maps, which are also called GUI maps or window declarations. If\nyour tool doesn’t include built-in support, you can usually create one\nwithout too much trouble. Window maps provide support for minor GUI\nchanges, such as renaming labels or relocating controls onscreen.

Because of them, a large set of tests that used to pass will fail\neven though nothing obvious has been done to affect the features that the\ntests are aimed at. The changes may be so minor that manual regression\ntesters would barely take notice.

When a test automator is reassigned, valuable\nknowledge can walk away. For instance, Sheila disables the disk I/O tests\ntemporarily, due to a particular bug in the product, then leaves to take that\nprogramming job in Topeka. Sheila’s replacement assumes that the tests\nare entirely obsolete and moves them to an archive, never to be seen again.\n\nTesters invest in regression automation with the expectation that the\ninvestment will pay off in due time. Sadly, they often find that the tests stop\nworking sooner than expected. The tests are out of sync with the product.\nThey demand repair. They’re no longer helping find bugs.

Each row\nconstitutes a test. Then create an automated test procedure that reads ina\nrow from your table, executes each input step, and verifies the expected\nresult. Spreadsheets are convenient for storing the test data. They make data\nentry easy. Most test tools and programming environments can access the\nspreadsheet data without much trouble. They can access the data in the\nnative spreadsheet format or in delimited text files that can easily be\nexported (.CSV files).\n\nAfter you've put together a data-driven test procedure, you can use it again\nand again to execute new tests.

Use a more complex\nvariant, keyword-driven automation, to support tests composed of varying\nsequences or several alternate paths.\n\nData-driven test automation supports nonprogramming testers. The\nautomators create the data-driven test procedures, and the testers create the\ntest data. In some cases, you might find it hard to automate the verification of\nthe test results. Have your test procedure collect the results and present them\nin the context of the input data to simplify the manual results analysis.\n\nData-driven test automation is becoming commonplace.

Identify each task function that can be used in\ntesting and include an entry in the task library for each. Declare the start\nstates that the task functions are valid in and the end states that they result\nin. This lets you tell which sequences of task functions are valid and so catch\nmalformed tests.\n\nThird, add support to read spreadsheet data, a row ata time. Using the\ndeclarations, interpret the first column‘as the name of a task function. The\nfollowing columns are arguments to the function. Execute the function with\nits arguments. Then move to the next row.\n\nThe result is keyword-driven test automation. Using it avoids complex logic in\nyour test scripts (Lesson 125). Because the tests are stored in spreadsheets,\nthey’re often easy for nonprogrammers to create and review. Because the\ntasks to be used and tested are all that the tester specifies, he can concentrate\non the tests, not the control language.\n\nIn contexts that require many nonprogrammers to create automated tests, we\nbelieve this is one of the better solutions. One drawback of this approach is\nthat you can’t write a test unless supported keywords already exist for the\ntasks you require. Defining and implementing the task functions can become\n\na major undertaking. |\nReviewer Hans Buwalda reports, “Keyword driven approaches, like my own\naction words, can provide a good basis. However, over the years I have\nlearned that testing and test automation remain very challenging areas and\nneed the involvement of experienced specialists to do it right.”\n\nWe have seen good results with this technique on projects that allowed\nsignificant advance time for automation development.

On a technical level, it’s actually more complicated than other\ninterface technologies. One way or another you'll have to learn the details of\nthe interface technology that your automated tests use. It’s your choice. We\n\nthink the GUI should be last on your list.\n\nHere’s a quick example. Lots of people have asked us for advice on\nautomating installers using GUI test tools. The best approach is usually to\nchuck the tool. Most installers have scripting interfaces that provide a better\napproach. InstallShield, for example, is a popular install system that is used\nto create installers for many products. Many testers don’t know they can run\nInstallShield installers with an option to record your selected install options.\nThese are stored in a response file. The installer can later be run unattended,\nusing the response file to specify the install options. It’s easy; it’s cheap; and\nthe response file is simple to read and edit. It’s a cost-effective way of\nautomating installation (see Creating a Silent Installation http://support\ninstallshield.com/kb/display.asp?documents_id=101901).\n\nBut you're not testing the GUI!—Focus your attention on where automation\ncan help the most. Sometimes, you can effectively automate the GUI; other\ntimes you can’t. Don’t let people’s preconceptions of what automation has to\nlook like limit you.\n\n5.

Most\nmanagers expect their programmers to unit test, and most programmers\nclaim that they do. Actual practice, however, is extremely variable and often\nhard to confirm.\n\nTrue unit testing tests units in isolation. Stubs are created to handle outgoing\ncalls, and drivers are created to provide incoming calls. Building these stubs\ncan be a major effort.\n\nA more popular form of automated unit testing avoids stub development by\n\ntesting units in context. We might call this unit integration testing. For systems\nthat are built from the bottom up, this form of automation can be rather easy\nto automate.\n\nYou will need a scaffolding such as Junit or Xunit to manage test suite\nexecution.

They do know a lot about testing,\nexcept as compared to someone who focuses all his energy on testing:\nsomeone like you! | |\n\nFrom the perspective of a tester, many programmers don’t actually know\nmuch about software testing (just as many testers don’t know much about\nprogramming). What they do know is often based on testing their own code.\nThey overemphasize strategies appropriate to their own idiosyncrasies. _\nPeople who understand testing requirements better should provide input\nand review. |\n\nProgrammers’ lack of knowledge about testing becomes a bigger problem when\ncombined with the disdain that many programmers hold for testers. This disdain\nstems from a perception that testers are under-informed about software in\ngeneral. Consequently, programmers may deliver automation that is quite\nclearly different from what was requested or expected. To guard against this,\nplan to review the test automation code. Programmers are accustomed to being\ngiven requirements they don’t fully understand. A common strategy they use is\nto make a best guess, write a program, and then fix it later based on feedback.\nThis strategy is understandable given the vagueness and confusion that often\ntiddle requirements and other programming requests. The danger comes when\nthis strategy is applied to test automation. Don’t make the mistake of thinking\nthat simply running the test suite will tell you if it works. Some test suite bugs\nwill cause tests to fail; these you'll find and fix. Others will cause tests to pass\nwhen they have no right to, and you'll never know it.

If you don’t Write test cases this way, you don’t have\nto create this type of documentation just to Satisfy the standard. The standard\n\nprovides a framework, a structure, and a set of definitions, not a mandated\nset of sections. ,\n\nThe standard has been widely studied and discussed. People in the field\nknow about it. This standard has been the basis for many (perhaps most) of\nthe test documentation templates that circulate from company to company. It\nhas become the basis of conversation about test planning and test\ndocumentation (for better or worse) in and across many companies.\n\nTwo of us, Bach and Kaner, have served as trial consultants (experts for use at\ntrial) in cases involving defective products, and colleagues of ours have\nserved in other cases and given us detailed debriefings. We’ve seen cases in\nwhich poor test documentation has been a part of an underlying problem\nthat led to litigation. Even if the documentation was not a key problem, some\nof the companies whose products were allegedly defective or who were\naccused of fraud would have been better served if their test documents were\nclearer and better organized. Their mess weakened their defense.

When we would\ncomment on these problems, we sometimes were told that the problems are\ndue to misuse of the standard. After all, it is very flexible. Testers don’t have\nto use the standard in an inappropriate way. _ |\n\nTo us, this feels like a “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people” type of\nargument. Sometimes this is a valid argument, but sometimes it’s not.\nRegarding the IEEE 829 case, we have seen problems enough times, in the\nhands of people we respect, in use by companies who have been working\nwith 829-based templates for several projects, that we believe that the\nproblems reflect weakness in the Standard, and they should not be dismissed\nas reflecting incompetence of the people using it.\n\nThe argument, “Guns don’t kill people” reads differently if the gun in\nquestion has a hair trigger and no safety and is left loaded in a public place\nwith an official-looking notice that says, “Use this gun for all projects.”\n\nHere are some of the issues that we have with the Standard, in practice:\n\n© The assumption underlying the Standard appears to be a waterfall-like\napproach in which tests are developed early, documented carefully, and",

In our view, you should create\nnew tests that are more complex as the program gets more stable and\nmore powerful as you gain more insight. To the extent that maintenance\ncosts of test documentation encourage you to reuse old tests instead of\ndeveloping more powerful new ones and to stick with your current\ntesting strategy instead of improving it as you learn, the test .\ndocumentation is part of the problem and not part of the process.\n\nMassive test documents create a compliance mentality.

We have reviewed or audited\nenormous test documents, that the authors considered adequate or\ncomplete, only to discover gaping holes—key testing strategies or areas of\nrisk were completely missing. It is too easy to overlook the absence of\neven the most obvious tests when the test documents run hundreds or\nthousands of pages. .\n\nm1 The maintenance costs of these long documents are enormous. When the\nsoftware changes, you don’t just have to change the parts of the\ndocumentation that are tied to that aspect of the software.

We'll conclude this\nlist of issues by mentioning a different experience. Several companies start\nwith a carefully signed-off statement that the testing process will be\ndocumented to a certain degree, that a template (based on 829) will be\nfollowed, that the testing strategy will be thus and so. Then they get part\nway through the project and abandon the signed-off statement in favor of,\nas they see it at the time, getting real work done on a real schedule.

They try to do\ngood work, know that they can make mistakes, and expect you to find those\nmistakes.\n\nFor a tester, testability is anything that makes it easier to test software. When\ntalking to programmers, a more practical definition is testability is visibility\n\nand control (Lesson 137). This definition states the nature of the features that\nwill help you. Understanding that, they can suggest features that you haven't\nthought of (or didn’t ask for) but that will be helpful. What kinds of features\nshould you ask for? Lesson 137, Testability is Visibility and Control, provides a\nnumber of examples.\n\nMany testers have been frustrated in their attempts to get testability features\nfrom programmers. We believe that there are three key points to being\nsuccessful with such requests.\n\nSpeak their language. It is helpful if you can read design documents and\ncode.

Top managers, in particular, are\n\nrone to making decisions using data that they don’t understand. By\ndefinition, a measurement is a thin slice of the whole picture. Any\nmeasurement that reduces the picture to a small set of numbers is a gross\nsimplification. If you understand the context of a measurement, you have\nhope of using measurements productively. Top management often isn’t\n\npresented with that context.\n\nWe encourage you to experiment with measurement. We use measurement to\naid us in learning about how the project is going and how the quality of the\nproduct is coming together. Executives worry us because, in our experience,\nthey use metrics not for learning but primarily to assert control over\nsomething they don’t understand. :\n\nDoes that mean you should never give numbers to executives? That’s not a\nrealistic option in many companies. But you can be cautious about what you\nprovide, you can anticipate misunderstandings and flag problems upfront,\nand you can refuse to provide certain numbers. For example,\n\n= Don’t storm into some executive’s office complaining that the average\nprogrammer takes 1.4 weeks to fix a bug, and Joe takes 5.3 weeks.

We understand that in some companies, information flow is more limited and that\nmanagers assert more right to control the flow of information.

Perhaps\n\nthese suggestions will help:\n\nLae j ; . ’ . . . .\nIf You are just introducing the idea of testing status reporting to your project team, circulate the reports as\nwidely as you reasonably dare, within the cultural context of your company. Use informal channels to let\n\na broader §roup of people know of the existence of these reports and let them ask the project manager to\n\ninclude them on the distribution list.

You should support your\nteam, and sometimes this might require heavy overtime for a few days or\nweeks. Sometimes the project manager will need your help to pull the project\nback on track or to get it finished. By all means, do everything that you\nreasonably can do, if it will help. But choose your own pace and make your\nown commitments. Be a volunteer, not a victim.?\n\nYou don’t have to promise the impossible. You don’t have to lie. You don’t\nhave to cover up problems. In fact, as a tester, the essence of your job is to\nexpose problems and not to cover them up. You don’t have to, and you never\nshould, compromise your integrity.\n\nYour power comes from having the freedom to say what's so, to the people\nwho need to hear it. If you compromise your reputation for integrity, you'll\nweaken one of the core supports of your power.\n\nSome employers are unreasonable and abusive, and you can’t change them.\n\nIf the job is intolerable, get your resume on the street and leave when you\nfind a better job.\n\nsevecacscscsssscesecetoreeeececescc ccc I nO IE aan\nCeCe besa eaten eeeeeeeaaeeeee rere seen teenetuverecececec ccc gagacuas\nMT Ov esac bon ecavavarecbereeaveveraceresnesavenstavepessgsansceraparpaseeeseserareeneeses eens ey een\n\nMany testing groups work chronic overtime.

This situation isn’t what we're talking about\nwhen we refer to abusive overtime. Remember, however, that your staff\nmembers each have different limits. Some have family commitments or other\ncommitments that are not very flexible. Deal graciously with the reality of\nyour situation.\n\nSome companies, or some project managers, chronically short-schedule their\n‘ects and expect their staffs to make up the difference:\n\nproj\n\na Don’t write schedules on the assumption that your staff will spend eight\nhours focused on-task each day. They wont. They can’t. They go to\nmeetings and trainings; they write status reports and memos and fill out\nsilly forms from your company’s HR department. If you're lucky, they\nspend six of eight hours per day focused on their official task, working the\nrest of the time on other things that they have to do.\n\na Don’t agree to schedules you know are impossible. Instead, estimate as\nwell as you can how long different tasks will take. When faced witha\nschedule that is shorter than your task list, ask which ones you should do\nfirst and which ones should be done if you have time left over. If you face\na manager who insists that you do all of them, ask which ones can be\ndone less thoroughly. And, ask for more staff. Sometimes, you'll face an\nunreasonable executive who insists that you agree to do everything\nwithin an impossible time. OK, so maybe you say the words. Remember,\nhowever, that the words aren’t magical. Reality will roll over your project\n\n_ and your staff like a steamroller, no matter what promises you make. In\nthe face of executives who will not listen to reason, manage your people _\nsensibly, or you'll lose them.\n\nAnother cause of chronic overtime is the manager who rewards people for\nbeing onsite (“at work”). Someone who is “at work” 80 hours per week\n\nmight be seen as more dedicated and more deserving than someone else who\nworks 45 hours a week but gets more and better work done. Your challenge is\nto find a way to make the results of the more efficient employee visible. We\ncan’t tell you in a book how to do this. The things we've done that were\nsuccessful were specific to the individuals (managers and staff).\n\nTwo other types of executives will pose overtime-related management |\nchallenges for you. One type believes that software scheduling is impossible,\nthat all schedules will slip, and so the best thing to do is to ask for whatever\nshe wants and push everyone as hard as possible. The other type seems to\nclieve that he demonstrates his value to the company by cajoling staff to |\nWork as much overtime as possible. We've run into both types. They are hare\n0 reason with because their positions are, in their essence, unreasonable: ne\n500d news is that there’s a lot of turnover among managers and executives In\n\nececeneee eres at me eres ee ent ae Nene RE CR PRE CEA AE BINS",

Your goal is to write a resume that appeals to the right\nsubmarket.\n\nci If you're interested in significantly different types of work, write a few\ndifferent resumes. Focus them differently, to highlight the skills, interests,\nand background that put you in the best light. Make sure that your\ndescriptions of your background and achievements are compatible across\nthe various versions of your resume (always assume that your employer\nwill eventually see all of your resumes).\n\nm Prepare a historical resume. A historical resume describes your experience\nin chronological order, from job to job, highlighting your achievements at\neach job. Some recruiters (and a few employers) prefer functional\nresumes, which describe your experience from skill to skill, mentioning\nthe company at which you developed the skill as a detail item. There’s\nnothing wrong with functional resumes, but they’re used by some people\nto exaggerate their experience or to hide periods of unemployment. As a\nresult, some hiring managers (us, for example) insist on developing a\nhistorical profile of job candidates. If you don’t have it in writing, we go\nthrough the tedium of asking for the details over the phone or in the face-\nto-face interview. If you have it in writing, then during a phone interview\nthat focuses on your history, offer to fax the manager a chronological\nversion of your resume. Some managers will be strongly impressed by\nyour preparation and thoughtfulness. Some hiring managers will ignore\njob candidates who only supply function resumes, unless the candidates’\nskills are an exceptional fit for the job and their claims are credible.\n\n= Prepare a functional or buzzword resume. Some companies scan resumes\ninto computers or have resumes reviewed quickly by people who don’t\nunderstand the position that you’re applying for. If you want to work for\none of those companies, you have to put the right buzz words or phrases\ninto the resume. Functional resumes are good for this.

You can get certified by other groups as well\n\nOur impression is that the certification exams aren’t all that difficult to pass\nThe questions are often fairly predictable, If you take an exam-focused |\nreview course, you'll probably pass the exam. Some SToups post sample\nuestions on the Net from time to time. From what we've seen, exams are\ntypically multiple-choice and sometimes open-book, They often test your\nknowledge of vocabulary and of relatively simple concepts and basic skills\nThe fact that someone is certified doesn’t mean that he’s an expert. |\n\nMany of the people who get certified do so after taking a series of courses,\nnot just the review course.

In our experience, these people value\ntheir certification and feel that they gained a lot from the process.\n\nCertification can be useful on a resume. It tells your prospective employer\nthat you’re serious enough about the field to take enough continuing\neducation to be able to pass a certification exam. This differentiates you from\nmost of the rest of the people applying for any testing job. However, if you’re\ncertified (but a nonprogrammer) and someone else isn’t certified but can\nprogram, don’t be surprised if you’re not the one who gets the test\nautomation job. Your certification can carry you only so far.\n\nOn balance, we think the software testing and software quality certification\nefforts have been beneficial to the profession.

(A few court decisions have been made since 1996, but they confirm\nKaner’s summary. For example, the most recent court decision on computer-\nrelated malpractice is Heidtman Steel Products, Inc. v. Compuware Corp., 1999.\nThis decision rejected a malpractice lawsuit and provided an extensive list of\nrevious rejections.) Until we have broad and genuine agreement in the field\non the skills and decision-making processes that lead to appropriate choices\nof practices, we think it would be reckless to declare the field a profession\nand to throw the membership of the field to the mercy of the malpractice-law\n\nlegal system.\n\nBy the way, professional negligence insurance for software engineers isn’t\nvery expensive today, because you are so unlikely to be successfully sued for\nprofessional negligence. In fields that face significant malpractice litigation,\ninsurance premiums are in the thousands, sometimes in the tens of\nthousands of dollars per year. Many states require licensed professionals to\ncarry malpractice insurance if they practice their profession in that state.\nHow much do you want to have to spend on insurance in order to be\nallowed to practice as an independent contractor or consultant?\n\nOur statements about malpractice are sometimes misinterpreted as efforts to\nprotect engineers who do bad work. We would like to clear that up. We are\npassionate about software quality. We strongly favor laws that hold\ndevelopers, including development companies, accountable for bad work.\nAll three of us have actively opposed the Uniform Computer Information\nTransactions Act because it protects software developers and vendors from\nliability for their defective products.

However, it is Certainly\ntrue that you must follow the changes with your testing. The more change\nin the product, the more testing you must do. This becomes a big deal in\n\nthe end game of a project.\n\n256 Treat test cycles as the heartbeat oi the\ntest Process.\n\nee ee rarer rrr rrr rrrerrrrrerrryrrerrrrrr rt Srer ri rrririrritiriviririrtiiriiti iri eee eee eee rere re eer\n\nYou provide your testing in cycles. Test cycles begin with a build and end\nwith one of two things: the next build or a determination that further testing\nis unwarranted. Your test strategy is made concrete in the test cycles. Plan\nyour test cycles to get the best information to your clients as soon as you\npossibly can. Here’s one way to organize a test cycle:\n\n1. Recetve the product. Make sure you get the right build.\n\n2. Configure your test system. Clean your test system. Restore the disk image\n\nto a pristine state or completely uninstall the previous version of the\nproduct.\n\n3. Verify testability. Is this a good build? Is it worth your time to test? Start by\n\nrunning smoke tests: simple tests that demonstrate that each major\nfunction is present and basically operational.\n\n4. Determine what is new or changed. What new code has been written that\nextends or modifies the capabilities of the product?\n\n5. Determine what bugs have been fixed. Also look for problems that have been\nrejected and respond accordingly. .\n\n6. Test fixes. Test fixes first while they’re still fresh in the minds of the\n\nprogrammers. If fixes fail, they want to know quickly.\n\n. a] je Ec fA a 7} 40> al , | “\n7 Test new or changed areas. The next hottest topic in the programmers \"\nis probably new code. _",

They do not run\n\nthe development project; they serve the project.\n\nc Testing is done on behalf of stakeholders in the service of developing,\nqualifying, debugging, investigating, or selling a product. Entirely\ndifferent testing strategies could be appropriate for these different\nobjectives.\n\n© Itis entirely proper for different test groups to have different missions. A\n\ncore practice in the service of one mission might be irrelevant or counter-\n\nproductive in the service of another.\n\nca Metrics that are not valid are dangerous.\n\nc The essential value of any test case lies in its ability to provide\ninformation (i.e., to reduce uncertainty).\n\nrc All oracles are fallible. Even if the product appears to pass your test, it\nmight well have failed it in ways that you (or the automated test program)\nwere not monitoring.\n\nm Automated testing is not automatic manual testing: It’s nonsensical to talk\nabout automated tests as if they were automated human testing.\n\nm Different types of defects will be revealed by different types of tests—tests\nshould become more challenging or should focus on different risks as the\nprogram becomes more stable.\n\nr1 Test artifacts are worthwhile to the degree that they satisfy their\nstakeholders’ relevant requirements.\n\nAn Example\n\nCee rere eee e reer etcenvereeeseeeaserereenes ence cg gc gener ene\nTARO EA Terese eee eee sere ee eee eae E neue ETE OAT Se ETLS SEES OEE ER ELSE EEE oe oeee roo oocce ccc gaa genenes\nTOPE eee eu ster eter ee eee net eres eeee nee ees en eT rete e ass eneseneveeesererestareredaneesenereeeseee rns\n\nvonider two projects.
