As information technology professionals, we are con‐ stantly challenged with tight timelines for building and enhancing in‐ formation systems, not just to provide new functionality, but also to ensure our systems meet the guidelines and standards for each indus‐ try.\n\nCompliance Affects Everyone, Not Just the Big Banks Compliance impacts all industries, and is becoming more important every day. Highly regulated industries including financial services and health care must meet strict standards for compliance. For online re‐ tailers, privacy and security standards must also be met. The social networking industry is facing regulations specific to consumer pro‐ tection and the use of customer information.\n\nNo industry is immune to meeting compliance requirements, and emerging regulations create more challenges to achieving perfor‐ mance objectives each year, both domestically and internationally. Any website that uses, stores, or processes personal or payment in‐ formation must address these challenges, notably for security and the payment card industry (PCI), but also for accessibility,access controls, confidentiality, and audit purposes.\n\nStaying abreast of techniques to meet performance goals and compli‐ ance regulations is an emerging trend within both performance engi‐ neering (PE) and DevOps. Conferences such as Velocity are address‐ ing these topics both tactically and strategically. Tactical, cutting-edge\n\n1\n\ntechniques are taking into account the needs of high-tech and web- facing companies as well as large Fortune® 500 enterprises. Strategi‐ cally, the emerging cultural paradigm of DevOps is becoming more prominent at larger companies, across complex architectures that in‐ clude legacy systems.\n\nPerformance Is Mandatory for Competitiveness and Business Success Today’s complex system architectures include rich user interfaces, the ability to execute complex business transactions quickly, and the need to provide critical information to users in a variety of formats, both desktop and mobile. How do you ensure you can meet business goals when the system is made up of a combination of web servers, appli‐ cation servers, and multiple middleware layers, including interfaces to web services, databases, and legacy systems? How do you achieve performance goals while meeting regulatory requirements such as multifactor authentication, encryption, and storing years’ worth of online transactional data? System designers and architects must un‐ derstand and manage the performance impacts of mandated features to ensure that service levels can be maintained.\n\nIn an effort to accelerate the timelines in providing new systems and enhancing functionality, we’re moving from the classic software de‐ velopment methodologies of the past to methodologies based on con‐ tinuous deployment. Adoption of agile and continuous integration and deployment models enables system functionality to be released more quickly, without sacrificing quality. Regulated industries are struggling to adopt these methodologies, as long-standing release management and testing processes are slow to adapt to accelerated delivery models.\n\nThe trend of ubiquitous access is putting more pressure on system performance. Access patterns and user behavior are changing. The mix of concurrent types of users and concurrent access is also forcing a change in how systems are designed to support these emerging trends. We must build systems to achieve performance for all users executing business-critical transactions, regardless of whether a par‐ ticular user is coming from a desktop PC, a mobile device, or a kiosk. When designing and building the system, we must test to ensure good performance for all users, at the same time.\n\n2\n\n|\n\nIntroduction\n\nCase Studies in Performance and Compliance\n\nThroughout this report, we’ll highlight various real-world examples. The examples span industries and identify some of the performance challenges created by adhering to regulatory requirements, and the strategies used to address those challenges. Some of these case studies followed the process outlined in this report proactively, while others required addressing the performance issues reactively. The examples have been anonymized to protect the innocent.\n\nTo Minimize Reputational Risk, Performance and Compliance Objectives Must Both Be Met Solving these challenges is not trivial. Business users demand systems that perform well and meet regulatory compliance requirements. Often the consequence of complying with mandatory regulations is a reduction of system performance.\n\nKey tenets of performance engineering—workload characterization (e.g., types of transactions, users, volumetrics), disciplined PE pro‐ cesses applied across the software development life cycle, and archi‐ tectural considerations of performance (load time, throughput/band‐ width)—are required for success.\n\nThrough a combination of system optimization techniques at every tier and integration point and the cooperation and commitment of the business to support performance improvement as a critical success factor, performance goals can and will be achieved.\n\nThis report outlines a disciplined process that can be followed to ach‐ ieve your performance goals, while meeting compliance objectives.\n\nPerformance Engineering Performance engineering is not merely the process of ensuring that a delivered system meets reasonable performance objectives; rather, PE emphasizes the “total effectiveness” of the system, and is a discipline that spans the entire software development life cycle. By incorporat‐ ing PE practices throughout an application’s life cycle, scalability, ca‐ pacity, and the ability to integrate are determined early, when it is still relatively inexpensive to tailor a solution specific to business needs.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n3\n\n4\n\nKey activities occur at different stages of the life cycle. Notably, these include:\n\nPlatform/environment validation: Determine if a particular technical architecture will support an organization’s business plan, by employ‐ ing workload characterization and executing stress, load, and endur‐ ance tests.\n\nWorkload characterization: A successful performance test requires a workload that simulates actual online and batch transactions as close‐ ly as possible. Workshops at which key business and technical pro‐ fessionals agree on representative user profiles help characterize workloads. If batch processing is required, representative messages must be defined. Online profiles are defined by the transactions each one performs.\n\nCapacity planning for performance: Understanding the point at which hardware resources are optimally utilized to support the system’s per‐ formance goals (e.g., response time, concurrency, and throughput) is critical. Balancing the number of resources while providing resiliency may require horizontal scaling to ensure continuity during failover.\n\nPerformance benchmarking: Execute sets of client-specific workloads on a system to measure its performance and its ability to scale. Also execute tests to determine an application’s performance limits.\n\nProduction performance monitoring: Proactively troubleshoot prob‐ lems when they occur, and develop repairs or “workarounds” to min‐ imize business disruption.\n\n|\n\nIntroduction",

      "content": "Challenges to Consider\n\nIn today’s competitive landscape, business must always consider the performance challenges involved in meeting user expectations. Nota‐ bly, you must minimize the cost of performance-related outages and enforce service-level agreements (SLAs).\n\nQuantifying the Cost of Poor Performance/ Outages Understanding the costs of an outage aids in understanding the return on investment (ROI) of proactive performance engineering. Remem‐ ber, operational costs “hide” the true cost of system development. Costs of downtime in production (post-deployment) include the following:\n\nRecovery costs\n\nThese include costs incurred during problem identification, anal‐ ysis and resolution, and validation testing, as well as external sup‐ port costs and data recovery costs.\n\nProductivity costs\n\nThese are calculated as duration of outage × total persons affected × average percentage of productivity lost × average employee costs.\n\nLost revenue\n\nThis is calculated as duration of outage × percentage of unrecov‐ erable business × average revenue per hour.\n\nConsider the example of a company that spends millions of dollars on application support instead of new application development. In this case, each 15-second timeout in the enterprise application integration\n\n5\n\n(EAI) infrastructure could result in a $5 call to an outsourced contact center. Over the course of six months, this could result in unanticipa‐ ted support costs of almost $3 million—funds that could otherwise have been used for new development efforts.\n\nIn addition to the costs of an outage, it is important to understand the scope of the impact—specifically, who is impacted. For example, an outage that affects the top customers, responsible for the majority of revenue leveraged by the system, carries a much higher weight than one that affects only the smallest customers. When defining service levels for availability and transactions, consider which customers are impacted and when they’re impacted, especially in the context of busi‐ ness “events”(dates, time frames) where access to systems is more cru‐ cial.\n\nService-Level Agreement (SLA) Enforcement Service-level agreements help organizations meet business objectives. By clearly defining and measuring against goals, organizations can monitor progress internally and in relation to competitors.\n\nSLAs are critical because they provide business metrics and key per‐ formance indicators for organizations to manage against. SLAs spe‐ cific to response time (e.g., a web page must render within three sec‐ onds) can be effectively measured with application performance man‐ agement (APM) technologies. The primary goal of IT is to service the business, and well-defined SLAs provide a clear set of objectives, iden‐ tifying the activities that are most appropriate to monitor, report, and build incentives around. Few organizations clearly define SLAs.\n\nService-level agreements should be designed with both organizational costs and benefits in mind. When set too low, business value is nega‐ tively affected. When set too high, additional and unnecessary costs may be incurred. Establishing and agreeing on the appropriate service levels requires IT and the business groups to work together to set re‐ alistic, achievable SLAs.\n\n6\n\n|\n\nChallenges to Consider\n\nPerformance Goals\n\nMeasurement is the first step that leads to control and eventually to improvement. If you can’t measure something, you can’t understand it. If you can’t understand it, you can’t control it. If you can’t control it, you can’t improve it.\n\n— H. James Harrington\n\nAll systems must strive to avoid the culture of it’s not a problem until users complain. The non-functional goals for system performance must be part of the overall business requirements. Business require‐ ments are the output of the inception (requirements and analysis) phases of any system development initiative.\n\nMany business initiatives do not effectively define and track the non- functional requirements (NFRs) of response time, throughput, and scalability. Non-functional requirements are not limited specifically to performance, though all have an effect on a system’s ability to scale and perform. For reference, common NFRs include:\n\nUsability\n\nUser and application documentation\n\nSecurity\n\nTransition\n\nData conversion\n\nSystem capacity and scalability (resource utilization)\n\nInteroperability\n\nRobustness\n\nPerformance (response time, throughput, concurrency)\n\nReliability\n\nAvailability\n\nFlexibility\n\nMaintainability • Portability1\n\n1. Definitions for many of these NFRs, often referred to as Quality Attributes, can be found here.\n\nChallenges to Consider\n\n|\n\n7\n\nKey performance objectives and internal incentives should ideally support defining and reporting against service level compliance and regulatory compliance. This can be best accomplished by ensuring there are clearly defined regulatory compliance requirements and well-defined service-level agreements. Managing to these require‐ ments and SLAs can then be enabled by identifying and executing activities to monitor, report, and build incentives around. Keep in mind that any undocumented requirements will likely be missed, and managing these requirements will not be possible.\n\nA critical first step toward defining and implementing SLAs is the identification of the key business transactions, key performance indi‐ cators (KPIs), and system transaction volumetrics. Development and PE teams should begin the discussion of service-level agreements and deliver a draft at the end of each analysis phase within each iteration. For example, these may include transaction response times, batch processing requirements, and data retention requirements.\n\nRegulatory requirements including access control, confidentiality, and logging should also be addressed at this time. The requirements will help determine if a performance test and proof-of-concept design val‐ idation test is required in order to verify that specific service levels are achievable while meeting these requirements.\n\nLarge organizations frequently don’t define service-level objectives, and find it difficult to meet these objectives when they’re added later, during analysis phases; enforcing them is therefore a challenge.\n\nPerformance goals and non-functional requirements must be defined to ensure that a system can be effectively managed.\n\nEffective Searching at a SaaS Digital Storage Provider To meet compliance goals the system was architected to process emails upon ingestion to facilitate quick retrieval when needed.\n\nAt a digital storage records provider, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) email archiving offering was created to support the Sarbanes-Oxley compliance required of financial services institutions. The SaaS pro‐ vider’s customers used the solution to fulfill their compliance re‐ quirements for storing every email for at least seven years, with avail‐ ability for searching and retrieval. The challenge of building custom solutions (including infrastructure), staying current with regulations and technologies, and ensuring adequate capacity was always avail‐\n\n8\n\n|\n\nChallenges to Consider\n\nable was met by using the SaaS provider. The SaaS provider had to provide the capability to search through more than one billion emails to meet its customers’ goals.\n\nThis performance challenge was solved by using third-party search‐ ing tools from Oracle, which implemented full-text searching. Emails, including bodies and attachments, were indexed on ingestion, in batches and in realtime. Thus, this was a time-space tradeoff, incur‐ ring large amounts of storage needed to support the indexing design, with the benefit of performance. Implementation of specific parti‐ tioning design patterns also allowed the SaaS provider to meet per‐ formance requirements, usually separating data by dates, allowing for parallel searching across large date ranges.\n\nChallenges to Consider\n\n|\n\n9\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\nThe term regulatory compliance refers to the adherence of an organi‐ zation to the laws, specifications, regulations, and standards required for an industry. Companies in each industry face unique criteria spe‐ cific to their industry, and must meet those conditions. Enforcement of standards varies by industry and situation, though penalties for failing to meet them can be severe.\n\nMany regulatory standards exist to protect individuals’ and compa‐ nies’ data. Examples of protected data include driver’s license numbers, social security numbers, account numbers, credit card numbers, med‐ ical records, claims submissions, and any other private information.\n\nFederal Regulations If you are doing business in the US, here are some of the most impor‐ tant regulations, described in relation to their impact on performance:\n\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), 1999\n\nGLBA is focused on protecting the privacy of consumer infor‐ mation held by financial institutions. It requires companies to provide consumers with privacy notices that explain the financial institutions’ information-sharing practices. Consumers have the right to limit some sharing of their information. User access to systems must be recorded and monitored for potential abuse of that data. This requires logging and access controls, which can impact performance.\n\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 1996\n\nHIPAA includes a few key goals. The act requires the protection and confidential handling (encryption) of protected health infor‐\n\n11\n\nmation (PHI), gives American workers the ability to transfer and continue health insurance coverage for themselves and their fam‐ ilies when they change or lose their jobs, and mandates industry- wide standards for health care information for electronic billing and other processes. User access to systems must be monitored, and data must be secure throughout all transactions. The require‐ ments for confidentiality and access control can impact perfor‐ mance.\n\nSarbanes-Oxley (SOX), 2002\n\nThe purpose of the SOX Act is to oversee financial reporting pro‐ cesses for finance professionals. It includes reviewing legislative audit requirements and protecting investors through more accu‐ rate corporate disclosures. The act established a public company accounting oversight board and deals with issues of auditor in‐ dependence, corporate responsibility, and enhanced financial dis‐ closure. User access, including login and transactions, must be recorded and monitored, adding overhead to all activity.\n\nChildren’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), 1998\n\nCOPPA prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information from children under 13 without parental consent. It mandates website operators to collect only “reasonably necessary” personal information for an online activity. Recent revisions (2013) to this act address changes in the way children use and access the Internet, including the increased use of mobile devices and social networking. The modified rule widens the definition of children’s personal information to include persistent identifiers such as cookies that track a child’s activity online, as well as geo‐ location information, photos, videos, and audio recordings. Re‐ quiring an online “permission slip” adds system activity to check if permission has been granted, in addition to the overhead of the transactions required to obtain the authorization initially. Rules for captured data must also be configured to support this data access. This requires access controls, which can impact perfor‐ mance, as the authentication and authorization requirements re‐ quire additional system activity for each request.\n\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 1974 and 2011 FERPA is intended to protect the rights of students and to ensure the privacy and accuracy of education records. The act applies to all institutions that are recipients of federal aid administered by the Secretary of Education. It prevents the disclosure of personally\n\n12\n\n| Regulatory Compliance\n\nidentifiable information (PII) in a student’s education record without the consent of a parent or eligible student. As with COP‐ PA, the checks for permission to access data—including rules, ac‐ cess controls, and authorization checks for each system request— result in additional system activity.\n\nInternational Laws and Regulations Globally accessible applications may need to comply with multiple laws and regulations from other countries. An example of this is the European Union (EU) Data Protection Initiative (Directive 95/46/ EC), which requires protecting the privacy of all personal data collec‐ ted for or about citizens of the EU. In these cases the application ar‐ chitect must consider if it makes sense for the application to adhere to a superset of regulations, if one can be found (e.g., use the highest encryption level that is required across all the countries), or to selec‐ tively implement different regulations based on each country. Multiple code bases may be practical, with the goal of achieving optimal per‐ formance for the user base.\n\nFor example, the security requirements for 10% of users may impact performance severely for those users; the other 90% of users may re‐ quire a lower level of encryption, and implementing a two-tiered sys‐ tem can rsult in increased performance for the vast majority of users. The trade-off is based on the performance impacts of implementing different levels of regulations versus the operational impact of man‐ aging the diverse implementations. The latter may require multiple deployments of some components based on country, or additional code complexity to handle the country differences.\n\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is also worth noting. FCPA prohibits companies from paying bribes to foreign political figures and government officials for the purpose of obtaining business. Many companies may use third-party vendors as representatives in foreign countries. This isn’t as much of a technical issue but may hinder a company’s ability to choose vendors.\n\nThe Primary Challenge Considering these well-known regulations, which represent a subset of federal regulations, it quickly becomes apparent that systematic controls must be put in place when building systems to ensure com‐\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\n|\n\n13\n\npliance. The primary challenge and objective is achieving the non- functional goals of performance while meeting key regulatory re‐ quirements with regard to access control, confidentiality, and logging.\n\n14\n\n| Regulatory Compliance",

      "content": "Aligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\nMeeting both compliance and performance objectives requires struc‐ ture and discipline. Compliance is usually a functional requirement while performance is most often a non-functional requirements. A structured process will achieve better overall performance by defining and tracking both functional and non-functional requirements to‐ gether. Meeting both objectives can be accomplished by following the process outlined in the remainder of this report. This process includes the following steps:\n\n1. Define the business goals for performance.\n\n2. Identify constraints. These include:\n\na. Business constraints\n\nb. Regulatory and compliance constraints\n\n3. Design and develop for performance goals.\n\n4. Execute performance measurement and testing.\n\n5. Implement performance monitoring.\n\n6. Mitigate risks.\n\n1. Define the Business Goals for Performance Ultimately, the goal of system development is to meet the business goals of your organization. Business goals include meeting compliance objectives. Without the business, information technology is irrelevant.\n\n15\n\nUnderstanding the business goals must be the first step, and under‐ standing the system performance goals and expectations is of primary importance. For example, if the business goals of a financial services provider include executing more financial transactions (i.e., money transfers) in a shorter period of time, the business problem translates to clear performance expectations. The transactions per second (TPS) rate required from the system can be calculated. The process of defin‐ ing the business performance goals must be disciplined and thorough and include the business partners.\n\nThe business motivation for visibility into performance goals must also be captured. This will translate into the reporting requirements and metrics used by the IT department and the corporate internal business users, and external customers. The metrics and reporting requirements can be used to define the reports and dashboards used when monitoring the system and business transactions.\n\n2. Identify Constraints Once performance goals have been established, project constraints must be well understood. Constraints typically include resource (i.e., hardware, software, network), geography (i.e., location of users and the infrastructure), and time (i.e., operating windows) constraints, and regulatory compliance requirements regarding access control, confi‐ dentiality, and logging. Understanding, defining, and documenting constraints requires com‐ munication with business partners. As constraints are constantly changing, staying current with emerging regulations is also critical. Depending on the size of the organization, an internal compliance team may be responsible for identifying and auditing systems for compliance. In other cases, outside agencies can be used.\n\n2a. Identifying Business Constraints As part of the business requirements phase, functional and non- functional requirements are defined and documented. Functional re‐ quirements define what the system must do. Non-functional require‐ ments define how the system must do it. Business constraints may be subtle. For example, marketing campaigns can affect the way a system is implemented. Consider the scenario of a marketing campaign ban‐ ner image that is presented to a user upon logging in to a secure home page. The image for the banner may be selected from multiple cam‐\n\n16\n\n| Aligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\npaigns depending on rules defined by the business. The retrieval of the image requires selection of the campaign by the rules implemented by the business. This flexibility results in targeted marketing cam‐ paigns based on user characteristics and behavior. The constraint is the need to process the business rules during the page rendering pro‐ cess. This constraint requires additional processing and must be con‐ sidered in the design of the system.\n\n2b. Identifying Regulatory and Compliance Constraints Access control, confidentiality, and logging are the primary compli‐ ance requirements that must be defined, documented, and imple‐ mented in such a way as to minimize performance impact.\n\nAccess control is often implemented using role-based access models. Depending on the implementation model, achieving robust perfor‐ mance may be difficult. Access control must be enforced at both the authentication layer and the services layer. In many cases, back-end transactions are required to verify access to the service being called. This level of access control must be implemented with performance in mind, reducing the overall number of transactions to ensure com‐ pliance. This can be a challenging model to implement.\n\nConfidentiality is typically addressed via encryption, both for pass‐ words and for confidential data. Confidential data cannot be stored or transmitted in clear text. Regulations dictate the security policies that must be followed to ensure compliance.\n\nLogging may be required to ensure compliance. Synchronous logging implementations can slow down performance. A common technique to reduce the performance impact is to leverage asynchronous logging and auditing techniques.\n\nSecurity Compliance for a Large Hardware Provider Corporate security implemented the best practice configuration rules to limit Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks but did not consider scenarios where the configuration would prohibit certain use cases.\n\nA large portal-based application used Apache web servers for the front-end presentation tier. Corporate security manadated security requirements which caused performance issues, as the settings re‐ stricted transaction duration. These settings were based on regula‐\n\nAligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\n|\n\n17\n\ntions interpreted incorrectly by corporate security to minimize trans‐ action duration and vulnerability to DDoS attacks. The timeout was set for less than 30 seconds to tighten security as much as possible and ensure compliance. These settings were applied globally and af‐ fected all system transactions. Unfortunately not all transactions were able to execute within this time frame, and responses for some re‐ porting functions exceeded the threshold.IT revisited the standards and worked with business representatives and was able to increase the timeout and receive an exemption for these reporting transac‐ tions.\n\n3. Design and Develop for Performance Goals When designing a system, performance must be a priority. Under‐ standing the demands that may be placed on them—particular func‐ tions, batch jobs, or components—should be at the top of a developer’s to-do list when designing and building systems. Early in the design process, developers should test code and components for perfor‐ mance, especially for complex distributed architectures. For example, if 50 services are going to be built using a framework including web services, middleware, databases, and legacy systems, a proof-of- concept (POC) performance test should be part of the design process. After building out two or three key transactions based on the proposed architecture, run the test. This will help determine if the design will scale to support the expected transaction load before the entire system is built. Many strategies can be designed into the system to ensure optimal performance. Some examples include asynchronous logging and caching of user attributes and shared system data. Being judicious is always recommended if there’s a requirement that only affects certain customers. It’s worth considering multiple code sets depending on the requirements of key customers. For example, if 90% of users won’t see a benefit from preloading data, the code to pre-load/cache data should be built in such a way as to only support the 10% of users that will see the performance benefit.\n\n18\n\n| Aligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\n4. Execute Performance Measurement and Testing Performance measurement requires discipline to ensure accuracy. In order to identify and establish specific tests, the PE team must model, via a workload characterization model, real-world performance ex‐ pectations. This provides a starting point for the testing process. The team can modify and tune the model as successive test runs provide additional information. After defining the workload characterization model, the team needs to define a set of user profiles that determine the application pathways that typical classes of users will follow. These profiles are used and combined with estimates from business and technical groups throughout the organization to define the targeted performance behavior criteria. These profiles may also be used in conjunction with predefined performance SLAs as defined by the business.\n\nOnce the profiles are developed and the SLAs determined, the per‐ formance test team needs to develop the typical test scenarios that will be modeled and executed. In addition, the performance test environ‐ ment must be identified and established. This may require acquiring hardware and software, or can be leveraged from an existing or shared environment. At a minimum, the test environment should closely represent the production environment, though it may be a scaled- down version.\n\nThe next critical part of performance testing is identifying the quantity and quality of test data required for the performance test runs. This can be determined through answering different questions: Are the test scenarios destructive in nature to the test bed of data? Can the database be populated in such a way that it’s possible to capture a snapshot of the database before any test run and restored between test runs? Can the test scenarios create the data that they require as part of a setup script, or does the business complexity of the data require that it be created one time up front and then cleaned up as part of the test sce‐ narios? One major risk to the test data effort, if using an approach leveraging actual test scripts, is that one of the test scripts may fail during the course of the test runs and the data will have to be recreated anyway, using external tools or utilities.\n\nAs soon as these test artifacts have been identified, modeled, and de‐ veloped, the performance test can begin with an initial test run, mod‐\n\nAligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\n|\n\n19\n\neling a small subset of the potential user population. This is used to shake out any issues with the test scripts or test data used by the test scripts. It also validates the targeted test execution environment in‐ cluding the performance test tool(s), test environment, system under test (SUT) configuration, and initial test profile configuration param‐ eters. In effect, this initial test is a “smoke test” of the performance test runtime environment.\n\nAt the point when the PE smoke test executes successfully, it is time to reset the environment and data and run the first of a series of test scenarios. This first scenario will provide significant information and test results that can be used by the performance test team defining the performance test suites.\n\nThe performance test is considered complete when the test team has captured results for all of the test scenarios making up the test suite. The results must correspond to a repeatable set of system configura‐ tion parameters as well as a test bed of data.\n\nThe following diagram outlines the overall approach used for assessing the performance and scalability of a given system. These activities represent a best-practices model for conducting performance and scalability assessments.\n\nEach test iteration attempts to identify a system impediment or prove a particular hypothesis. The testing philosophy is to vary one element, then observe and analyze the results. For example, if results of a test are unsatisfactory, the team may choose to tune a particular configu‐ ration parameter and then rerun the test.\n\n20\n\n| Aligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\nProactive Vulnerability Testing for Enterprise Systems IT security scans may impact system availability. IT security needs to partner with application teams to balance coverage without im‐ pacting systems.\n\nAt many large corporations, regulations are enforced by running au‐ tomated security scans. These scans can run continuously and have adverse effects on performance and availability. The scans either slow down performance dramatically or, even worse, cause faults within running processes requiring their restart. Interpretation of regula‐ tions must be carefully implemented to ensure compliance and bal‐ ance the performance impacts. A recent Wall Street Journal editori‐ al criticized Federal Trade Commission monitoring of IT depart‐ ments at companies that had security breaches, causing overreactions at times. Adjusting the schedule minimized the impact of these au‐ tomated scans as well as ensuring adequate system resources were available.\n\n5. Implement Performance Monitoring The increased complexity of today’s distributed and web-based archi‐ tectures has made it a challenge to achieve reliability, maintainability, and availability at the levels that were typical of traditional systems implementations. The goal of systems management and production performance monitoring is to enable measurable business benefits by providing visibility into key measures of system quality.\n\nTo be proactive, companies need to implement controls and measures that either enable awareness of potential problems or target the prob‐ lems themselves. Application performance monitoring (APM) not only ensures that a system can support service levels such as response time, scalability, and performance, but, more importantly, proactively enables the business to know when a problem will arise. When diffi‐ culties occur, PE, coupled with APM, can isolate bottlenecks and dra‐ matically reduce time to resolution. Performance monitoring allows proactive troubleshooting of problems when they occur and facilitates developing repairs or “workarounds” to minimize business disrup‐ tion.\n\nOrganizations can implement production performance monitoring to solve performance problems, and leverage it to inhibit unforeseen\n\nAligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\n|\n\n21\n\nperformance issues. It establishes controls and measures to sound alarms when unexpected issues appear, and isolates them. Unfortu‐ nately, the nature of distributed systems development has made it challenging to build in the monitors and controls needed to isolate bottlenecks, and to report on metrics at each step in distributed trans‐ action processing. In fact, this has been the bane of traditional systems management. However, tools and techniques have matured to provide end-to-end transactional visibility, measurement, and monitoring.\n\nAspects of these tools include dashboards, performance monitoring databases, and root cause analysis relationships allowing tracing and correlation of transactions across the distributed system. Dashboard views provide extensive business and system process information, al‐ lowing executives to monitor, measure, and prepare based on fore‐ casted and actual metrics. By enabling both coarse and granular views of key business services, they allow organizations to more effectively manage customer expectations and business process service levels, and plan to meet and exceed business goals. In short, they deliver the right information to the right people, at the right time. It is important to define what needs to be measured based on the needs of the business and IT.\n\nUnderstanding application performance and scalability characteris‐ tics enables organizations to measure and monitor business impacts and service levels, further understand the end user experience, and map dependencies between application service levels and the under‐ lying infrastructure. The integration of business, end user, and system perspectives enables management of the business at a service and ap‐ plication level.\n\n6. Mitigate Risk As risks are identified through analysis of test results and application performance monitors, the impact of these risks must be categorized. Sample categories include:\n\nBusiness impact\n\n— Regulatory impacts for outages\n\n— High financial impact for outages\n\n— Application supports multiple lines of business\n\n— Application classified as business critical\n\n22\n\n| Aligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations",

The release and deployment model will influence how and when a particular solution or change is implemented. For example, if caching is going to be added, will this be implemented in a single release or will components be deployed in successive releases? Less code-invasive changes such as hardware configuration or changes isolated to a single tier (i.e., addi‐ tional database indexes) may be able to be handled in minor or emer‐ gency releases.\n\nSecurity Compliance for a Large Financial Services Provider Meeting compliance requirements to store seven years’ worth of data can lead to challenges in database table design to efficiently accom‐ modate large data sets.\n\nFinancial services compliance applications consist of very complex functionality, often relying heavily on the database layer to store meta- data and configuration information for multiple financial plan and benefits combinations. This results in the need for a stable and per‐ formant data model. Compliance often requires storage of transac‐ tional data for a period of seven years, in an online manner, resulting in potentially very large tables. Without accurate statistics for the da‐ tabase optimizer to rely upon, large table sizes can result in slow- running SQL and stored procedures. IT created a purging strategy and table partitioning strategies to limit the amount of data fetched in each request to enable fast and consistent data access response. In addition, the application tier was experiencing slow response times due to large amounts of computations for each request. Performance was improved through load balancing across multiple application\n\nAligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\n|\n\n23\n\nservers and increasing the number of application threads to leverage more CPU resources.\n\nDevelopment Methodology Considerations Software development methodologies vary by implementation and framework. Depending on the standards defined for an organization, the methodology followed may be dictated by the enterprise, or, if multiple methodologies are supported, it may depend on the require‐ ments/demands of the project. The process for achieving performance goals while addressing compliance requirements is applicable to and consistent across multiple methodologies, as portrayed in the dia‐ grams that follow.\n\nWaterfall The waterfall model is still followed by very large organizations for many critical system implementations. This progressive development process provides a disciplined structure, as well as checkpoints, to support a predictable set of requirements and releases. This disci‐ plined and rigid methodology requires both functional and non- functional requirements to be captured during the requirements phase and applied to the full development life cycle. Compliance require‐ ments are typically captured as functional requirements, while the non-functional requirements include performance and scalability.\n\n24\n\n| Aligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\nIterative Development: Agile and Scrum Functional compliance requirements and performance can also be ef‐ fectively addressed when following agile and Scrum methodologies.\n\nMany companies, including high-tech organizations and startups, have adopted agile as their primarily development methodology. Flex‐ ible and iterative development allows functional and non-functional requirements to be addressed in multiple iterations. Ideally, compli‐ ance requirements are captured as functional requirements in the early iterations.\n\nIterative and agile methods allow building of software in the form of completed, finished, and ready-for-use iterations or blocks, beginning with the blocks perceived to be of the highest value to the customer.\n\nScrum is an agile development model based on multiple small teams working independently. Within each iteration, certain steps must be followed to ensure the performance goals are defined, tested, and monitored.\n\nFollowing the disciplined process discussed above will enable you to meet both performance and compliance objectives. This process is\n\nAligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\n|\n\n25\n\napplicable to multiple development methodologies. By understanding the business needs, the system workload, and the reporting require‐ ments, you’ll be able to measure and monitor real world performance. This will ensure meeting the goals of performance and compliance requirements, providing visibility into key measures of system quality, all while proactively mitigating risks.\n\n26\n\n| Aligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\nConclusion\n\nGreenfield solutions rarely exist in highly regulated industries. Ach‐ ieving enterprise performance requires navigating regulatory compli‐ ance and systems constraints. The goal is to meet compliance require‐ ments while minimizing any reductions in system performance.\n\nThough many highly regulated industries are slow to adopt continu‐ ous integration and deployment models, addressing performance across the development life cycle and within each iteration will ensure reaching performance goals. Across all industries, regulations and re‐ quirements affect performance; maintaining performance as a pri‐ mary objective will enable success.\n\nThe primary objective for organizations is to ensure that they are aware of and take steps to comply with relevant laws and regulations while minimizing any impact on system performance. Addressing this challenge takes discipline and an understanding of existing and emerging regulations. Following the process outlined in this paper can and will enable success.\n\nReferences for This Report\n\nGLBA\n\nHIPAA\n\nSox\n\nCOPPA\n\nFERPA\n\n27\n\nAbout the Author Mark Lustig leads the Performance Engineering Practice for Collab‐ orative Consulting.

As information technology professionals, we are con‐ stantly challenged with tight timelines for building and enhancing in‐ formation systems, not just to provide new functionality, but also to ensure our systems meet the guidelines and standards for each indus‐ try.\n\nCompliance Affects Everyone, Not Just the Big Banks Compliance impacts all industries, and is becoming more important every day. Highly regulated industries including financial services and health care must meet strict standards for compliance. For online re‐ tailers, privacy and security standards must also be met. The social networking industry is facing regulations specific to consumer pro‐ tection and the use of customer information.\n\nNo industry is immune to meeting compliance requirements, and emerging regulations create more challenges to achieving perfor‐ mance objectives each year, both domestically and internationally. Any website that uses, stores, or processes personal or payment in‐ formation must address these challenges, notably for security and the payment card industry (PCI), but also for accessibility,access controls, confidentiality, and audit purposes.\n\nStaying abreast of techniques to meet performance goals and compli‐ ance regulations is an emerging trend within both performance engi‐ neering (PE) and DevOps. Conferences such as Velocity are address‐ ing these topics both tactically and strategically. Tactical, cutting-edge\n\n1",

Strategi‐ cally, the emerging cultural paradigm of DevOps is becoming more prominent at larger companies, across complex architectures that in‐ clude legacy systems.\n\nPerformance Is Mandatory for Competitiveness and Business Success Today’s complex system architectures include rich user interfaces, the ability to execute complex business transactions quickly, and the need to provide critical information to users in a variety of formats, both desktop and mobile. How do you ensure you can meet business goals when the system is made up of a combination of web servers, appli‐ cation servers, and multiple middleware layers, including interfaces to web services, databases, and legacy systems? How do you achieve performance goals while meeting regulatory requirements such as multifactor authentication, encryption, and storing years’ worth of online transactional data? System designers and architects must un‐ derstand and manage the performance impacts of mandated features to ensure that service levels can be maintained.\n\nIn an effort to accelerate the timelines in providing new systems and enhancing functionality, we’re moving from the classic software de‐ velopment methodologies of the past to methodologies based on con‐ tinuous deployment. Adoption of agile and continuous integration and deployment models enables system functionality to be released more quickly, without sacrificing quality. Regulated industries are struggling to adopt these methodologies, as long-standing release management and testing processes are slow to adapt to accelerated delivery models.\n\nThe trend of ubiquitous access is putting more pressure on system performance. Access patterns and user behavior are changing. The mix of concurrent types of users and concurrent access is also forcing a change in how systems are designed to support these emerging trends. We must build systems to achieve performance for all users executing business-critical transactions, regardless of whether a par‐ ticular user is coming from a desktop PC, a mobile device, or a kiosk. When designing and building the system, we must test to ensure good performance for all users, at the same time.\n\n2\n\n|\n\nIntroduction",

The examples span industries and identify some of the performance challenges created by adhering to regulatory requirements, and the strategies used to address those challenges. Some of these case studies followed the process outlined in this report proactively, while others required addressing the performance issues reactively. The examples have been anonymized to protect the innocent.\n\nTo Minimize Reputational Risk, Performance and Compliance Objectives Must Both Be Met Solving these challenges is not trivial. Business users demand systems that perform well and meet regulatory compliance requirements. Often the consequence of complying with mandatory regulations is a reduction of system performance.\n\nKey tenets of performance engineering—workload characterization (e.g., types of transactions, users, volumetrics), disciplined PE pro‐ cesses applied across the software development life cycle, and archi‐ tectural considerations of performance (load time, throughput/band‐ width)—are required for success.\n\nThrough a combination of system optimization techniques at every tier and integration point and the cooperation and commitment of the business to support performance improvement as a critical success factor, performance goals can and will be achieved.\n\nThis report outlines a disciplined process that can be followed to ach‐ ieve your performance goals, while meeting compliance objectives.\n\nPerformance Engineering Performance engineering is not merely the process of ensuring that a delivered system meets reasonable performance objectives; rather, PE emphasizes the “total effectiveness” of the system, and is a discipline that spans the entire software development life cycle. By incorporat‐ ing PE practices throughout an application’s life cycle, scalability, ca‐ pacity, and the ability to integrate are determined early, when it is still relatively inexpensive to tailor a solution specific to business needs.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n3",

Over the course of six months, this could result in unanticipa‐ ted support costs of almost $3 million—funds that could otherwise have been used for new development efforts.\n\nIn addition to the costs of an outage, it is important to understand the scope of the impact—specifically, who is impacted. For example, an outage that affects the top customers, responsible for the majority of revenue leveraged by the system, carries a much higher weight than one that affects only the smallest customers. When defining service levels for availability and transactions, consider which customers are impacted and when they’re impacted, especially in the context of busi‐ ness “events”(dates, time frames) where access to systems is more cru‐ cial.\n\nService-Level Agreement (SLA) Enforcement Service-level agreements help organizations meet business objectives. By clearly defining and measuring against goals, organizations can monitor progress internally and in relation to competitors.\n\nSLAs are critical because they provide business metrics and key per‐ formance indicators for organizations to manage against. SLAs spe‐ cific to response time (e.g., a web page must render within three sec‐ onds) can be effectively measured with application performance man‐ agement (APM) technologies. The primary goal of IT is to service the business, and well-defined SLAs provide a clear set of objectives, iden‐ tifying the activities that are most appropriate to monitor, report, and build incentives around. Few organizations clearly define SLAs.\n\nService-level agreements should be designed with both organizational costs and benefits in mind. When set too low, business value is nega‐ tively affected. When set too high, additional and unnecessary costs may be incurred. Establishing and agreeing on the appropriate service levels requires IT and the business groups to work together to set re‐ alistic, achievable SLAs.\n\n6\n\n|\n\nChallenges to Consider",

This can be best accomplished by ensuring there are clearly defined regulatory compliance requirements and well-defined service-level agreements. Managing to these require‐ ments and SLAs can then be enabled by identifying and executing activities to monitor, report, and build incentives around. Keep in mind that any undocumented requirements will likely be missed, and managing these requirements will not be possible.\n\nA critical first step toward defining and implementing SLAs is the identification of the key business transactions, key performance indi‐ cators (KPIs), and system transaction volumetrics. Development and PE teams should begin the discussion of service-level agreements and deliver a draft at the end of each analysis phase within each iteration. For example, these may include transaction response times, batch processing requirements, and data retention requirements.\n\nRegulatory requirements including access control, confidentiality, and logging should also be addressed at this time. The requirements will help determine if a performance test and proof-of-concept design val‐ idation test is required in order to verify that specific service levels are achievable while meeting these requirements.\n\nLarge organizations frequently don’t define service-level objectives, and find it difficult to meet these objectives when they’re added later, during analysis phases; enforcing them is therefore a challenge.\n\nPerformance goals and non-functional requirements must be defined to ensure that a system can be effectively managed.\n\nEffective Searching at a SaaS Digital Storage Provider To meet compliance goals the system was architected to process emails upon ingestion to facilitate quick retrieval when needed.\n\nAt a digital storage records provider, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) email archiving offering was created to support the Sarbanes-Oxley compliance required of financial services institutions.

It requires companies to provide consumers with privacy notices that explain the financial institutions’ information-sharing practices. Consumers have the right to limit some sharing of their information. User access to systems must be recorded and monitored for potential abuse of that data. This requires logging and access controls, which can impact performance.\n\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 1996\n\nHIPAA includes a few key goals. The act requires the protection and confidential handling (encryption) of protected health infor‐\n\n11",

User access to systems must be monitored, and data must be secure throughout all transactions. The require‐ ments for confidentiality and access control can impact perfor‐ mance.\n\nSarbanes-Oxley (SOX), 2002\n\nThe purpose of the SOX Act is to oversee financial reporting pro‐ cesses for finance professionals. It includes reviewing legislative audit requirements and protecting investors through more accu‐ rate corporate disclosures. The act established a public company accounting oversight board and deals with issues of auditor in‐ dependence, corporate responsibility, and enhanced financial dis‐ closure. User access, including login and transactions, must be recorded and monitored, adding overhead to all activity.\n\nChildren’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), 1998\n\nCOPPA prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information from children under 13 without parental consent. It mandates website operators to collect only “reasonably necessary” personal information for an online activity. Recent revisions (2013) to this act address changes in the way children use and access the Internet, including the increased use of mobile devices and social networking. The modified rule widens the definition of children’s personal information to include persistent identifiers such as cookies that track a child’s activity online, as well as geo‐ location information, photos, videos, and audio recordings. Re‐ quiring an online “permission slip” adds system activity to check if permission has been granted, in addition to the overhead of the transactions required to obtain the authorization initially. Rules for captured data must also be configured to support this data access. This requires access controls, which can impact perfor‐ mance, as the authentication and authorization requirements re‐ quire additional system activity for each request.\n\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 1974 and 2011 FERPA is intended to protect the rights of students and to ensure the privacy and accuracy of education records. The act applies to all institutions that are recipients of federal aid administered by the Secretary of Education. It prevents the disclosure of personally\n\n12\n\n| Regulatory Compliance",

As with COP‐ PA, the checks for permission to access data—including rules, ac‐ cess controls, and authorization checks for each system request— result in additional system activity.\n\nInternational Laws and Regulations Globally accessible applications may need to comply with multiple laws and regulations from other countries. An example of this is the European Union (EU) Data Protection Initiative (Directive 95/46/ EC), which requires protecting the privacy of all personal data collec‐ ted for or about citizens of the EU. In these cases the application ar‐ chitect must consider if it makes sense for the application to adhere to a superset of regulations, if one can be found (e.g., use the highest encryption level that is required across all the countries), or to selec‐ tively implement different regulations based on each country. Multiple code bases may be practical, with the goal of achieving optimal per‐ formance for the user base.\n\nFor example, the security requirements for 10% of users may impact performance severely for those users; the other 90% of users may re‐ quire a lower level of encryption, and implementing a two-tiered sys‐ tem can rsult in increased performance for the vast majority of users. The trade-off is based on the performance impacts of implementing different levels of regulations versus the operational impact of man‐ aging the diverse implementations. The latter may require multiple deployments of some components based on country, or additional code complexity to handle the country differences.\n\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is also worth noting. FCPA prohibits companies from paying bribes to foreign political figures and government officials for the purpose of obtaining business. Many companies may use third-party vendors as representatives in foreign countries. This isn’t as much of a technical issue but may hinder a company’s ability to choose vendors.\n\nThe Primary Challenge Considering these well-known regulations, which represent a subset of federal regulations, it quickly becomes apparent that systematic controls must be put in place when building systems to ensure com‐\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\n|\n\n13",

For example, if the business goals of a financial services provider include executing more financial transactions (i.e., money transfers) in a shorter period of time, the business problem translates to clear performance expectations. The transactions per second (TPS) rate required from the system can be calculated. The process of defin‐ ing the business performance goals must be disciplined and thorough and include the business partners.\n\nThe business motivation for visibility into performance goals must also be captured. This will translate into the reporting requirements and metrics used by the IT department and the corporate internal business users, and external customers. The metrics and reporting requirements can be used to define the reports and dashboards used when monitoring the system and business transactions.\n\n2. Identify Constraints Once performance goals have been established, project constraints must be well understood. Constraints typically include resource (i.e., hardware, software, network), geography (i.e., location of users and the infrastructure), and time (i.e., operating windows) constraints, and regulatory compliance requirements regarding access control, confi‐ dentiality, and logging. Understanding, defining, and documenting constraints requires com‐ munication with business partners. As constraints are constantly changing, staying current with emerging regulations is also critical. Depending on the size of the organization, an internal compliance team may be responsible for identifying and auditing systems for compliance. In other cases, outside agencies can be used.\n\n2a. Identifying Business Constraints As part of the business requirements phase, functional and non- functional requirements are defined and documented. Functional re‐ quirements define what the system must do. Non-functional require‐ ments define how the system must do it. Business constraints may be subtle. For example, marketing campaigns can affect the way a system is implemented. Consider the scenario of a marketing campaign ban‐ ner image that is presented to a user upon logging in to a secure home page. The image for the banner may be selected from multiple cam‐\n\n16\n\n| Aligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations",

This flexibility results in targeted marketing cam‐ paigns based on user characteristics and behavior. The constraint is the need to process the business rules during the page rendering pro‐ cess. This constraint requires additional processing and must be con‐ sidered in the design of the system.\n\n2b. Identifying Regulatory and Compliance Constraints Access control, confidentiality, and logging are the primary compli‐ ance requirements that must be defined, documented, and imple‐ mented in such a way as to minimize performance impact.\n\nAccess control is often implemented using role-based access models. Depending on the implementation model, achieving robust perfor‐ mance may be difficult. Access control must be enforced at both the authentication layer and the services layer. In many cases, back-end transactions are required to verify access to the service being called. This level of access control must be implemented with performance in mind, reducing the overall number of transactions to ensure com‐ pliance. This can be a challenging model to implement.\n\nConfidentiality is typically addressed via encryption, both for pass‐ words and for confidential data. Confidential data cannot be stored or transmitted in clear text. Regulations dictate the security policies that must be followed to ensure compliance.\n\nLogging may be required to ensure compliance. Synchronous logging implementations can slow down performance. A common technique to reduce the performance impact is to leverage asynchronous logging and auditing techniques.\n\nSecurity Compliance for a Large Hardware Provider Corporate security implemented the best practice configuration rules to limit Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks but did not consider scenarios where the configuration would prohibit certain use cases.\n\nA large portal-based application used Apache web servers for the front-end presentation tier.

The timeout was set for less than 30 seconds to tighten security as much as possible and ensure compliance. These settings were applied globally and af‐ fected all system transactions. Unfortunately not all transactions were able to execute within this time frame, and responses for some re‐ porting functions exceeded the threshold.IT revisited the standards and worked with business representatives and was able to increase the timeout and receive an exemption for these reporting transac‐ tions.\n\n3. Design and Develop for Performance Goals When designing a system, performance must be a priority. Under‐ standing the demands that may be placed on them—particular func‐ tions, batch jobs, or components—should be at the top of a developer’s to-do list when designing and building systems. Early in the design process, developers should test code and components for perfor‐ mance, especially for complex distributed architectures. For example, if 50 services are going to be built using a framework including web services, middleware, databases, and legacy systems, a proof-of- concept (POC) performance test should be part of the design process. After building out two or three key transactions based on the proposed architecture, run the test. This will help determine if the design will scale to support the expected transaction load before the entire system is built. Many strategies can be designed into the system to ensure optimal performance. Some examples include asynchronous logging and caching of user attributes and shared system data. Being judicious is always recommended if there’s a requirement that only affects certain customers. It’s worth considering multiple code sets depending on the requirements of key customers. For example, if 90% of users won’t see a benefit from preloading data, the code to pre-load/cache data should be built in such a way as to only support the 10% of users that will see the performance benefit.\n\n18\n\n| Aligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations",

In order to identify and establish specific tests, the PE team must model, via a workload characterization model, real-world performance ex‐ pectations. This provides a starting point for the testing process. The team can modify and tune the model as successive test runs provide additional information. After defining the workload characterization model, the team needs to define a set of user profiles that determine the application pathways that typical classes of users will follow. These profiles are used and combined with estimates from business and technical groups throughout the organization to define the targeted performance behavior criteria. These profiles may also be used in conjunction with predefined performance SLAs as defined by the business.\n\nOnce the profiles are developed and the SLAs determined, the per‐ formance test team needs to develop the typical test scenarios that will be modeled and executed. In addition, the performance test environ‐ ment must be identified and established. This may require acquiring hardware and software, or can be leveraged from an existing or shared environment. At a minimum, the test environment should closely represent the production environment, though it may be a scaled- down version.\n\nThe next critical part of performance testing is identifying the quantity and quality of test data required for the performance test runs. This can be determined through answering different questions: Are the test scenarios destructive in nature to the test bed of data? Can the database be populated in such a way that it’s possible to capture a snapshot of the database before any test run and restored between test runs? Can the test scenarios create the data that they require as part of a setup script, or does the business complexity of the data require that it be created one time up front and then cleaned up as part of the test sce‐ narios? One major risk to the test data effort, if using an approach leveraging actual test scripts, is that one of the test scripts may fail during the course of the test runs and the data will have to be recreated anyway, using external tools or utilities.\n\nAs soon as these test artifacts have been identified, modeled, and de‐ veloped, the performance test can begin with an initial test run, mod‐\n\nAligning Performance Objectives with Compliance Regulations\n\n|\n\n19",

In effect, this initial test is a “smoke test” of the performance test runtime environment.\n\nAt the point when the PE smoke test executes successfully, it is time to reset the environment and data and run the first of a series of test scenarios. This first scenario will provide significant information and test results that can be used by the performance test team defining the performance test suites.\n\nThe performance test is considered complete when the test team has captured results for all of the test scenarios making up the test suite. The results must correspond to a repeatable set of system configura‐ tion parameters as well as a test bed of data.\n\nThe following diagram outlines the overall approach used for assessing the performance and scalability of a given system. These activities represent a best-practices model for conducting performance and scalability assessments.\n\nEach test iteration attempts to identify a system impediment or prove a particular hypothesis. The testing philosophy is to vary one element, then observe and analyze the results.

IT security needs to partner with application teams to balance coverage without im‐ pacting systems.\n\nAt many large corporations, regulations are enforced by running au‐ tomated security scans. These scans can run continuously and have adverse effects on performance and availability. The scans either slow down performance dramatically or, even worse, cause faults within running processes requiring their restart. Interpretation of regula‐ tions must be carefully implemented to ensure compliance and bal‐ ance the performance impacts. A recent Wall Street Journal editori‐ al criticized Federal Trade Commission monitoring of IT depart‐ ments at companies that had security breaches, causing overreactions at times. Adjusting the schedule minimized the impact of these au‐ tomated scans as well as ensuring adequate system resources were available.\n\n5. Implement Performance Monitoring The increased complexity of today’s distributed and web-based archi‐ tectures has made it a challenge to achieve reliability, maintainability, and availability at the levels that were typical of traditional systems implementations. The goal of systems management and production performance monitoring is to enable measurable business benefits by providing visibility into key measures of system quality.\n\nTo be proactive, companies need to implement controls and measures that either enable awareness of potential problems or target the prob‐ lems themselves. Application performance monitoring (APM) not only ensures that a system can support service levels such as response time, scalability, and performance, but, more importantly, proactively enables the business to know when a problem will arise. When diffi‐ culties occur, PE, coupled with APM, can isolate bottlenecks and dra‐ matically reduce time to resolution.

In fact, this has been the bane of traditional systems management. However, tools and techniques have matured to provide end-to-end transactional visibility, measurement, and monitoring.\n\nAspects of these tools include dashboards, performance monitoring databases, and root cause analysis relationships allowing tracing and correlation of transactions across the distributed system. Dashboard views provide extensive business and system process information, al‐ lowing executives to monitor, measure, and prepare based on fore‐ casted and actual metrics. By enabling both coarse and granular views of key business services, they allow organizations to more effectively manage customer expectations and business process service levels, and plan to meet and exceed business goals. In short, they deliver the right information to the right people, at the right time. It is important to define what needs to be measured based on the needs of the business and IT.\n\nUnderstanding application performance and scalability characteris‐ tics enables organizations to measure and monitor business impacts and service levels, further understand the end user experience, and map dependencies between application service levels and the under‐ lying infrastructure.

The release and deployment model will influence how and when a particular solution or change is implemented. For example, if caching is going to be added, will this be implemented in a single release or will components be deployed in successive releases? Less code-invasive changes such as hardware configuration or changes isolated to a single tier (i.e., addi‐ tional database indexes) may be able to be handled in minor or emer‐ gency releases.\n\nSecurity Compliance for a Large Financial Services Provider Meeting compliance requirements to store seven years’ worth of data can lead to challenges in database table design to efficiently accom‐ modate large data sets.\n\nFinancial services compliance applications consist of very complex functionality, often relying heavily on the database layer to store meta- data and configuration information for multiple financial plan and benefits combinations. This results in the need for a stable and per‐ formant data model. Compliance often requires storage of transac‐ tional data for a period of seven years, in an online manner, resulting in potentially very large tables. Without accurate statistics for the da‐ tabase optimizer to rely upon, large table sizes can result in slow- running SQL and stored procedures. IT created a purging strategy and table partitioning strategies to limit the amount of data fetched in each request to enable fast and consistent data access response.
