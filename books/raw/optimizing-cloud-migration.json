Flexibility, scalability, cost reduction, and reduced overheads are just some of the reasons why the case for moving to the cloud is compelling to many businesses. This is a very real trend, with a 2015 survey reporting that 72% of executives sta‐ ted that the cloud was essential to their strategy, and 90% of busi‐ nesses reported using the cloud in some capacity.\n\nThis move is also accompanied by a move away from server-based solutions to a world of Software as a Service-based solutions—with modern applications increasingly moving toward being jigsaw puz‐ zles built from many different building blocks. Load balancing, file storage, databases, search, caching, authentication, data warehous‐ ing, microservices, APIs, media streaming, data processing, job queuing, and workflow are just some of the services available to build cloud-based applications. True cloud applications are funda‐ mentally different from traditional hosted applications, not just in how they are hosted, but in the nature of how they go about solving problems to deliver resilient and flexible solutions.\n\nThe promise of the cloud, therefore, is to enable you to build a sys‐ tem with levels of performance and availability that wouldn’t have been available to you when building an on-premise solution (at least without an investment of time and money that is beyond the scope of most companies). There are many challenges to achieving this, both practical and technological, but one area that is often over‐ looked is that of Internet performance.\n\n1\n\nThis book will help take you on that journey—from your first foray into the cloud, to having a highly performant cloud-based system, discussing the best methods for optimizing Internet performance at each stage.\n\nWhat Is Internet Performance? Internet performance refers to the overhead of traversing the com‐ plex path of connectivity across the global Internet between the user’s ISP and the entry point to your company’s infrastructure. It is also sometimes referred to as the middle mile or backhaul.\n\nOptimizing Internet performance essentially involves optimizing the route that data takes to cross the public Internet and reach your sys‐ tems. This can range from understanding the routing that is in place between different locations, or serving content from different loca‐ tions based on the location of the user.\n\nTraditionally, this area of performance has been overlooked, as it is seen as being “out of our control.” However, in recent years there has been a growth in understanding from organizations that this perfor‐ mance is a representation of their brand, and it is irrelevant to the end user whether the degradation occurs inside or outside the com‐ pany’s network. This has led to a growth in demand from organiza‐ tions improve the visibility and control necessary performance of connectivity across their online infrastructure. To meet this demand, a range of tools known collectively as Internet Performance Management (IPM) tools have been created.\n\nfor\n\nto\n\nFlawed Thinking: You Can’t Control Internet Performance in the Cloud It is a mistake to think that because of the way cloud services are provided—as off-the-shelf services—you cannot take any control of Internet performance. In actual fact, the move to the cloud can potentially give you more control over the levels of Internet perfor‐ mance that you can deliver.\n\nThe geographically distributed nature of cloud platforms allows you more control over where you deliver content from. The possibility of using multiple clouds to dynamically serve users based on loca‐ tion further enhances this. However, optimizing Internet perfor‐\n\n2\n\n| Optimizing Cloud Migration\n\nmance requires attention, and it is easy to deliver suboptimal Internet performance if it is not addressed properly.\n\nThe following chapters will illustrate how to stay on top of this chal‐ lenge when moving to the cloud and guide you through the various steps en route to delivering a highly Internet-performant cloud solu‐ tion.\n\nIntroducing the Trend: the Move to the Cloud\n\n|\n\n3\n\nPhase 1: Preparing for Your Journey to the Cloud\n\nBefore you start your journey to the cloud, there are a few important mindset changes that you need to make in order to be able to take full advantage of the systems offered by cloud providers.\n\nThe Nature of Cloud Geography Choosing a cloud provider is a difficult decision; it is a rapidly evolving industry with new offerings coming into the market on a weekly basis. There are obvious elements that should be considered when choosing a provider, such as reputation, services available, cost, and support. However, it is important that some consideration be given to the following aspects that have a major impact on Inter‐ net performance:\n\nGeographic distribution\n\nCloud providers are global platforms and portray themselves as such. In reality, however, their services are delivered from fewer than 20 geographical locations, which tend to congregate around certain areas of the world. This, of course, is more than the range of locations offered by the majority of data centers, but it is important to understand where these locations are and how that relates to the service you are wanting to provide. Per‐ formance is an important element of this alongside other con‐ siderations such as data sovereignty, redundancy, etc.\n\n5\n\nRouting\n\nThe geographical location is of course only part of the story. Cloud providers don’t own a worldwide network; they rely on transit providers to connect cloud locations to markets. So, it is also essential that the cloud provider has appropriate routing in and out of the geographical location. For example, if your users are in Indonesia, a cloud provider based in Singapore would seem appropriate, but that would be undermined if upon fur‐ ther investigation it turned out that they routed all traffic from Indonesia via Los Angeles. While it sounds absurd, this is a gen‐ uine example of the sort of routing that can exist, and similar examples are not uncommon.\n\nResiliency\n\nIt is important to understand the level of resiliency that is being offered in a particular cloud region. Cloud providers will pro‐ vide multiple physical data centers in a region and allow for automatic distribution of services across these data centers.\n\nKey Concept—The Nature of Buying Has Changed Previously, the buying process was about descriptions of the capa‐ bilities of service provision backed by service-level promises. ISPs would generally be open about the nature of connectivity they had in place and would be willing to work with you to improve that in bespoke ways if necessary.\n\nCloud providers are typically very reticent about sharing any details of the nature and levels of resilience they have in connectivity, focusing their SLAs on the services that they provide rather than the level of connectivity to specific markets. This is partly because it is not part of their stated services and partly because they cannot own or control the entire path to every market. This leaves the responsibility for ensuring the level and quality of connectivity with you. It is essential, therefore, that you put effective monitoring in place (see “4. Build a Comprehensive Monitoring Solution” on page 15).\n\nUnderstanding the nature of the geographic distribution of cloud providers enables you to start making an informed choice about which will be the best provider for your service to minimize latency (of course, latency will only be one element considered when decid‐\n\n6\n\n| Phase 1: Preparing for Your Journey to the Cloud\n\ning the appropriate cloud provider). A good starting point for this is to look at the region that is geographically nearest; however, that region may not actually be the best option. It is essential that you also consider the peering arrangements that the cloud provider has in place, and therefore the routing that will actually occur between your users and the cloud location.\n\nCloud providers often don’t have the most optimized routing between end users and their systems, so it is crucial to test this as much as possible up front to select the best locations. It’s even more important to continue monitoring this after the systems are in use by the public. IPM tools are core to your ability to understand the impact of cloud geography and topology on your users.\n\nBefore starting your journey to the cloud, it’s important to under‐ stand what the exact nature of the cloud is.\n\nFlawed Thinking: The Cloud Is Just Another Data Center It is easy to think of the cloud as simply a replacement data center with on-demand virtual machines. For many people, the first instinct is to just “lift and shift” their existing infrastructure to a cloud provider. This approach often results in disillusionment with the cloud, as it results in emphasis of the negative without taking advantage of the positives that the cloud has to offer.\n\nThe real benefits of the cloud are in its dynamic nature, the ability to create and destroy infrastructure on demand, the ability to use the scalable services, the ability to create geographically distributed sys‐ tems, etc. If you are just creating a fixed number of servers with installed software, then you are likely building a system that is less reliable and possibly more expensive than that provided by a tradi‐ tional data center.\n\nIt is often said that servers within data centers are like pets, whereas within the cloud (or other virtualized platforms) they are like cattle (a phrase that’s widely used but I think was originally coined by Randy Bias).\n\nThat is, when creating a system in a data center, you can:\n\nCarefully craft a system to meet your exact requirements\n\nFlawed Thinking: The Cloud Is Just Another Data Center\n\n|\n\n7\n\nInvestigate the physical location and the connectivity supplied\n\nDefine the exact hardware and configuration and apply bespoke optimizations if required\n\nApply your own monitoring and negotiate access to the core infrastructure monitoring from the data center\n\nOn top of all this, you can speak to the people responsible.\n\nIn the cloud, you give up control over many of these elements. You select from a range of offerings that are predefined and build your systems on top of them. The servers become throwaway; if there are any problems or if your requirements change, they are destroyed and new ones created. To those with an on-premise mindset, this can seem very limiting. However, when exercised to full advantage, the cloud can be incredibly powerful and liberating.\n\nFlawed Thinking: The Cloud Is Not Just Another Data Center As flawed as it is to view the cloud as just another data center, con‐ versely, it is just as wrong to start thinking of cloud providers as being something more than data centers.\n\nWhile the way cloud providers run their operations and the nature of the services they provide are very different from a traditional data center, it is important to remember that ultimately, they are just data centers. When you drill down to the core, they are simply buildings full of racks and servers with connectivity to the Internet. They face exactly the same challenges as those faced by traditional data cen‐ ters.\n\nWhen considering Internet performance, this is an essential point to remember. Cloud providers connect to the Internet in just the same manner as any other provider. Also, like any other provider, the nature of that connectivity is driven by many factors, including practical, economic, and political ones, as well as performance. The varying levels of importance given to these considerations are of course a business decision.\n\nCurrently, Internet performance is not something that cloud provid‐ ers use as a selling point; they typically sell more on price and func‐\n\n8\n\n| Phase 1: Preparing for Your Journey to the Cloud",

The days of them only using systems that you install and host are ending. Creating modern applications has become a matter of using Software as a Service and third-party serv‐ ices, alongside more traditional server-hosted solutions, as building blocks to build your complete applications. Your finished applica‐ tion may even span multiple cloud providers in addition to interact‐ ing with on-premise and other third-party systems.\n\nObviously, the distributed nature of systems provides additional challenges for Internet performance, and it is important that you understand some core pieces of information related to your applica‐ tion. You must:\n\n1. Understand the impact of performance issues caused by con‐ nectivity issues between the different elements of the system\n\n2. Have systems in place to react to poor performance in these interactions\n\n3. Have monitoring in place to understand what is happening and the impact it has\n\nBecause you don’t control everything, your responsibility shifts to understanding when problems are happening and then mitigating them.\n\nPhase 1: Dos and Don’ts Do\n\nEmbrace the benefits of the cloud-based services that are avail‐ able\n\nEmbrace the freedom of creating and destroying services on demand\n\nFlawed Thinking: Your Applications Will All Sit On Your Servers\n\n|\n\n9\n\nBe aware of the different regions in which cloud services are offered and choose appropriately\n\nDon’t\n\nThink the cloud is the same as on-premise hosting\n\nThink that cloud providers don’t face the same challenges as tra‐ ditional data centers when it comes to optimizing connectivity\n\nExpect the same level of control you have over hosted applica‐ tions\n\nAssume that cloud providers’ network connectivity will be fool‐ proof\n\n10\n\n| Phase 1: Preparing for Your Journey to the Cloud\n\nPhase 2: Beginning Your Journey to the Cloud\n\nWhen starting a migration to become a cloud-focused organization, there are four rules of good practice:\n\n1. Start small and gradually migrate systems\n\n2. Test, test, test—prove everything before committing to the move\n\n3. Understand your performance expectations\n\n4. Build a comprehensive monitoring solution\n\nThese rules apply equally when thinking only about Internet perfor‐ mance.\n\n1. Start Small and Gradually Migrate Systems Any rollout to the cloud should be completed as a gradual transi‐ tion, moving the lower-risk or biggest-win areas first while having systems that communicate back to your on-premise solution. Typically, legacy applications and data migration are the highest-risk areas, so the aim should be to create cloud-based services that miti‐ gate their risks. For example, the first phase may be to create an API in the cloud that provides access to data from an on-premise data‐ base—cloud-based data caching services can be used to deliver data returned from the API. Typically, this could be targeted at a specific region to evaluate the Internet performance. You can then gradually extend that cloud-based data provision until it eventually ends up not needing to communicate back to the source database at all. It is\n\n11\n\nalso possible to use an A/B testing approach to roll out the new sys‐ tem to a small percentage of users and optimize it before rolling it out to the full user base.\n\nStarting small minimizes the risk of the move to the cloud and allows you to investigate the Internet performance at a point where it is still possible to move to an alternate provider.\n\n2. Test, Test, Test—Prove Everything Before Committing to the Move The nature of the cloud is that everything is throwaway, you pay for what you use, and you can scale up and down at will. This allows you to try things out, see the reality of the situation, fail fast, and then move on. The systems you test on can also be completely live- like, giving the opportunity to do some full-performance testing. The benefits of this for functional correctness are well documented, but the impact on Internet performance is in some ways more important. It allows you to fire up systems, run tests from dis‐ tributed geographical locations, and monitor the Internet perfor‐ mance.\n\nThe important takeaway here is that if there are issues, you can raise them with the provider. It’s likely that the provider won’t be able to do anything about those issues, but the nature of the engagement allows you to walk away and investigate alternatives. It also allows for an A/B type release, gradually releasing the systems to subsets of users to determine whether the testing you have done is still valid with those real users.\n\nHaving proved the concept after testing shouldn’t end the testing. After migration to the cloud, ongoing testing (either explicit testing or by validating real-world performance via monitoring) should take place to ensure that the solution is still optimal. Moving a cloud system into production doesn’t necessarily require a long-term com‐ mitment or mean that that platform is set in stone—if it is not meet‐ ing requirements, then it should be modified. Don’t be afraid to move clouds.\n\n12\n\n| Phase 2: Beginning Your Journey to the Cloud\n\n3. Understand Your Performance Expectations Unless the specific goal of the migration is to realize performance improvements, it is likely that the performance of the system after migration is only required to match the existing system’s perfor‐ mance (though obviously any performance improvements would be gratefully received). Therefore, before migrating anything to the cloud, it is essential that you understand the nature of your applica‐ tion’s performance as it currently exists. The following four-stage process is good practice for identifying any application performance standards, but it applies equally when looking specifically at Internet performance:\n\nStage 1: Define a performance vision for the application\n\nThis will describe the nature of good performance for your sys‐ tem at a conceptual level, defining which elements of perfor‐ mance are important to your business. If this has already been defined for the existing solution, it will remain the same for the migrated solution.\n\nStage 2: Understand the nature of the system\n\nMake sure you are aware of the nature of the system you are migrating by answering the following key questions:\n\nWhat are the high-risk areas? What areas of the system are most prone to poor performance, or what areas are impac‐ ted the most by poor performance? For example, for an ecommerce site, a product page is an area where poor per‐ formance has a particularly large impact because it directly reduces sales. Equally, it could be that product search was a high-risk area because it was an area where performance had previously been seen to be negatively impacted by change.\n\nWhich areas currently have performance issues? What is the cause of those issues? Are there particular areas that have been identified as triggering poor performance? For example, it could be that high CPU usage on your database server causes poor performance, affecting the reliability of the integration to your accounts system.\n\nWhat is the impact of poor performance on the user, the business, and on other systems? Do users stop using the system when poor performance hits, or do they get mal‐\n\n3. Understand Your Performance Expectations\n\n|\n\n13\n\nformed orders? Is the business affected by poor sales, increased complaints, or migration to competitors? Does poor performance result in other systems within the orga‐ nization experiencing issues? For example, does your sys‐ tem running slowly impact the ability of the warehousing system to correctly process orders?\n\nUnderstanding the impact allows the creation of a risk-based assessment of the importance of performance on all areas of the system.\n\nStage 3: Understand the characteristics of the end users\n\nIt is essential when migrating a system to the cloud that you understand the system’s end users. Very important when con‐ sidering Internet performance is the users’ geographic location, but it is also important to understand:\n\nThe type of people they are (as this reflects their tolerance for poor performance). For example, tech-savvy customers who have the opportunity to buy the same product else‐ where will likely be intolerant of poor performance. On the other hand, users of an internal system for non-urgent busi‐ ness tasks will tend to be much more tolerant of poor per‐ formance.\n\nThe types of system and connectivity they will be using (e.g., desktop or mobile). Mobile performance is impacted by a much wider set of issues than just the server perfor‐ mance (e.g., network latency, poor connectivity, or device performance). It is important that you understand the vary‐ ing impact of your performance on these types of users as opposed to high-speed broadband desktop users if they make up a significant element of your users.\n\nAlso remember that end users may actually be other systems (your own or third parties) that your system under migration interacts with.\n\nStage 4: Define acceptance criteria/KPIs for performance\n\nCompleting this analysis allows the creation of acceptance KPIs that can be used as the basis of proof-of-concept tests when evaluating cloud providers/solutions. These will then flow through into validation testing after migration is complete.\n\n14\n\n| Phase 2: Beginning Your Journey to the Cloud\n\nKey Concept—Think in Business Transactions, Not Individual Elements When looking at cloud systems, you are generally looking at a com‐ plex set of interactions between different elements—some on your cloud-based servers, some using cloud-based tools, and some pro‐ vided by third parties. The infrastructure, latency, and network connectivity between all these elements are generally out of your control.\n\nWhen evaluating performance, it is perfectly valid to set targets for specific individual elements where possible, but it is essential that you start setting targets for the full end-to-end process to under‐ stand the impact of this dispersal of functionality to systems outside your direct control.\n\n4. Build a Comprehensive Monitoring Solution Cloud providers will give you access to a lot of information about their systems via extensive and configurable dashboards. These are an excellent resource and should form an integral part of your sys‐ tem health monitoring; however, they only tell part of the story. Cloud provider dashboards are only focused on the elements of the system that they are providing, which leaves some important gaps:\n\nThe performance and behaviors within your application (APM)\n\nThe experience actually being had by end users (EUM)\n\nThe Internet performance of your application (IPM)\n\nThese gaps can leave you in a situation where all your cloud dash‐ boards are green, but your system is unavailable. The dashboards are not designed for in-depth or worldwide reporting. It is impor‐ tant then that your monitoring is based on how your application is performing, not how the server is performing. There are several sets of tools that are essential for this.\n\nApplication Performance Monitoring Application Performance Management/Monitoring (APM) tools (such as AppDynamics or New Relic) were originally created to give an understanding of what is going on “under the hood” of your\n\n4. Build a Comprehensive Monitoring Solution\n\n|\n\n15\n\napplication, analyzing every application request down to the method call or SQL query level. APM tooling is also important for under‐ standing the impact of third-party dependencies on the perfor‐ mance of your application.\n\nUser Experience Monitoring The objective of this type of monitoring is to reflect what your user is actually seeing. There are two models for this type of monitoring: Real User Monitoring (RUM) and End User Monitoring (EUM).\n\nRUM gathers data from all user activity and passes that data back to a central collection server (typically by injecting a snippet of Java‐ Script into every page), which allows for analysis of your users’ exact experience. This will flag any unexpected behavior and can help you drill down to identify the cause of the problem. RUM is also useful for determining whether there is a pattern to the types of users who are experiencing a particular problem.\n\nEUM is similar, but relies on synthetically generated, regularly repeated tests of specific functionality. EUM will quickly show if tasks are varying over time and whether key functionality is still act‐ ing as expected.\n\nA good monitoring solution will combine elements of both models.\n\nEnd-to-End Transaction Monitoring In recent years, APM products have shifted their focus to also look at the end-to-end breakdown of a user request, giving an under‐ standing of what the user has experienced within the browser (including the performance of client-side scripts) and allowing the tracing of that same request right through your application. This incorporates APM and EUM in a single solution.\n\nThis is a very valuable set of tooling, providing a deep view into end-to-end performance on an aggregated basis (by type, location, or technology of user). These tools are also able to drill down into specific outliers to determine the cause of issues.\n\nNetwork Performance Monitoring While RUM and EUM give you a good understanding of what the end user is experiencing and APM illustrates what’s going on on\n\n16\n\n| Phase 2: Beginning Your Journey to the Cloud\n\nyour server, network performance monitoring (NPM) looks at the areas in between (though only within your infrastructure, not the public internet).\n\nIn traditional data centers, this would involve operational manage‐ ment tools such as Nagios, or NPM tools such as Zabbix or Solar‐ Winds to see details of how your network infrastructure is behaving. (It’s worth noting that these two types of tools are increasingly over‐ lapping.)\n\nThe network infrastructure is largely hidden from you in cloud environments, but NPM is still an important tool if you are using a hybrid cloud approach that combines cloud services with on- premise applications.\n\nInternet Performance Management Despite the standard monitoring tools described so far, there still remains a visibility gap, even when providing end-to-end monitor‐ ing, as it has limited insight into the Internet performance of your system. This is where IPM tooling can be valuable.\n\nIPM tooling (such as Dyn Internet Intelligence) is designed to give you insight into the behavior of the connectivity between your users and cloud providers—the middle mile or backhaul. This is shown in terms of both availability and performance, which allows you to determine whether users are being impacted by connectivity or routing issues with a cloud provider and take action to mitigate it.\n\nKey Concept—Monitoring Must Become Dynamic In a traditional environment, adding a server to a monitoring solu‐ tion was often a manual process included as part of the rollout.\n\nIn the cloud world, you are living in a dynamic, ever-changing environment where servers and other services may well be added and removed at any time. It is important, therefore, that all moni‐ toring solutions you use reflect this and are able to dynamically pick up and remove elements, either automatically or via an API.\n\n4.

The ability to dynamically create infrastructure on demand removes the dependency on hardware that is characteristic of data centers.\n\nEverything you do in the cloud should assume failure will happen.\n\nThis is now a common practice for server infrastructure. The most famous example is Netflix’s Chaos Monkey: a tool that goes around intentionally disabling elements of the infrastructure to ensure that their resiliency systems can cope. This is rarely done at the network level, but the same rules can apply.\n\nIf your system suffers Internet performance problems, such as rout‐ ing issues that add overhead onto every request, then your system should be aware of this and be able to easily switch to another loca‐ tion. For example, if you normally serve content from Virginia because the majority of your requests come from users in Chicago, then in the event of Internet performance issues, it should be easy to switch to serving content from another relevant location, such as San Francisco. This allows you to respond not only to Internet per‐\n\n19\n\nformance issues but also to outages seen at specific data centers. Alternatively, rather than switching location—as this is not always possible due to practical issues (e.g., data)—the system could also be configured to move into a lower-bandwidth/minimized-service interaction state to minimize the impact.\n\nUnderstand the Cost of Performance and Monitoring as a Core Part of Capacity Planning The cloud allows you to provide all the systems needed to deliver a scalable system, but those systems do not come for free. Anyone who has used cloud-based services will tell you that it is very easy to run up much higher bills than expected. However, this can be miti‐ gated by intelligent system design.\n\nKey Concept—Capacity Planning Has Changed Capacity planning used to be about understanding the capacity of your systems and ensuring that there was always sufficient head‐ room to allow for anticipated short/medium-term growth. In this model, a server hitting capacity was a negative position that indica‐ ted that capacity planning was failing and that the system may soon fail.\n\nIn the cloud world, this is reversed, and the objective should be to have a system that is always operating close to capacity. Resources are so easy to scale that scaling them ahead of time is generally a waste of money.\n\nAdding complexity will add cost—not only in terms of cloud costs, but also in terms of development and maintenance overhead. It is essential that you consider the following:\n\nLevel of usage\n\nScale systems only to the level of usage that you anticipate. There is no need to future-proof systems. You build systems that can scale, not that are at a capacity to meet any anticipated future demand. Good system architecture is essential here and, like other things, cloud-based system architecture is different from on-premise system architecture. As a general rule, the aim should be to use cloud-based services where possible, as they\n\n20\n\n| Phase 3: Enhancing Your Cloud Solution\n\nare prebuilt to be scalable with no input from you, and some are also built to be region-independent. Where you are building upon virtual machines, the aim should be for them to be hori‐ zontally scalable, meaning you can add and remove servers when desired with no impact on users.\n\nWhere your users are coming from\n\nOnly scale systems to meet demand in areas where you have a user base that warrants the additional cost and effort. Building and maintaining a multiregion system is a complex task, partic‐ ularly when it comes to data management, so it is not some‐ thing that should be entered into lightly. Before committing, use your monitoring to determine if there is sufficient demand from the region and, more importantly, what the impact is on users of the configuration that you have in place.\n\nWhen your users are coming\n\nThe nature of cloud systems, with their “pay as you use” charg‐ ing method and on-demand creation and destruction of resour‐ ces, means that you can scale your system up and down as needed. It is therefore best practice to analyze when your sys‐ tems are busy and scale up to meet demand and back down again afterwards. This can be on a daily, hourly, or even minute- by-minute basis.\n\nHow tolerant your users are\n\nWith an intelligent set of monitoring tools, you can determine how tolerant your users are of performance issues. For example, you may determine that users in Australia see performance that is notably worse than that seen by users in other areas of the world, which could trigger a need to invest in expanding to cloud providers with better Internet performance for Australian users. However, before making such an investment, it is a good idea to understand the impact that poor performance is having on those users. There are a couple of ways to investigate this: you could analyze the performance of your competitors to see how well you compare in that area, or alternatively, you could change performance and assess the impact. Improving perfor‐ mance is typically a complex task, so one option is to con‐ sciously reduce performance on your system to see the business impact. This may seem like an unusual suggestion, and it may be hard to sell within your business, but, while obviously not foolproof, it can be a quick and effective method of determining\n\nUnderstand the Cost of Performance and Monitoring as a Core Part of Capacity Planning\n\n|\n\n21\n\nthe value of investing a lot of time and effort in performance improvements.\n\nCombining all these factors, you can construct a system that is scaled to meet the optimal delivery to users while minimizing cost and complexity. However, like everything else, the cost of building and maintaining this system must be included when considering the cost optimization. In other words, don’t spend six months of time building a system that will save the equivalent of one month of time in reduced cloud costs.\n\nKey Concept—How Cloud Providers Sell Networking When dealing with data centers, network provision is usually sold as a pipe into your environment. This pipe typically has a limit but with an element of bursting available. Beyond this level, throughput is usually throttled. Each machine in the environment will then have a networking card, which will have a limit to the amount of throughput it can handle. The level of this throughput will be defined as part of the hardware definition of the machine.\n\nCloud providers, however, sell networking differently. They usually offer unlimited throughput into your environment, charged by the byte (or GB). Therefore, the limiting factor is now the infrastruc‐ ture that you run your application on, rather than the pipe into your environment.\n\nHowever, cloud providers are often limited in the information they provide about the networking capabilities of their machines, and will give high-level views such as S, M, or L, with the size determin‐ ing the size of the elements within the machine (memory, CPU, etc.), as well as the level of networking that it provides. Therefore, high-throughput but low-CPU/memory systems such as load bal‐ ancers can often end up having to be run on much beefier machines than expected to stop hitting the networking limits of the device. This can have a sizable impact on cost when sizing a new system.\n\nHowever, as you look to optimize your cloud service, there are a few common mistakes that can undermine your efforts.\n\n22\n\n| Phase 3: Enhancing Your Cloud Solution\n\nFlawed Thinking: Moving to the Cloud Means You Don’t Need an Ops Team A common misconception is that a move to the cloud can be accompanied by a reduction in the levels of ops support that is needed for production systems. This is completely untrue. Cloud- based systems need as much in-house expertise as any other hosted systems. Instead, it’s the nature of the job that is changing. Manag‐ ing a cloud-based system is as complex as managing an on-premise system. It requires a high level of specialized knowledge and under‐ standing of the implementation, as well as industry knowledge in both traditional networking and cloud systems. Cloud systems do not look after themselves, but they do provide a new paradigm in how to build, monitor, and maintain these systems. This requires as much expertise and management as on-premise systems.\n\nBecause little pre-emptive optimization of the core infrastructure can be done, the focus becomes more on building fault tolerance into systems, building comprehensive monitoring solutions, and the ability to react quickly to situations to take advantage of the scaling and geographical options offered by cloud-based services. The skill‐ sets of your ops team will need to evolve to meet these new chal‐ lenges.\n\nFlawed Thinking: Third Parties are Optimized for You Modern systems are not only dealing with incoming systems, but they are also routing requests out to other remote systems, often over the public Internet. This could be to third-party services or other services within the organization. When assessing the Internet performance of systems after migration to the cloud, it is essential that you also consider the performance of communications with these dependencies.\n\nKey Concept—Direct Connections Are Available Although the default nature of cloud providers is to communicate over the public Internet, many of them offer the option to intro‐ duce a direct point-to-point connection into their infrastructure from an external point, typically your back office or other data cen‐\n\nFlawed Thinking: Moving to the Cloud Means You Don’t Need an Ops Team\n\n|\n\n23\n\nter. In essence, this is a leased-line connection into your cloud envi‐ ronment.

It is a perfectly valid solution to build your system as a jigsaw puzzle of components from multiple cloud providers. Certain cloud providers may provide services that other cloud providers do not—cloud systems are generally designed to be modular and use standard, open formats for communication. In this case, the same precautions should be taken as defined previ‐ ously.\n\nHowever, when thinking about Internet performance, the primary advantage of using multiple cloud providers is the locations each one offers relative to your users. It is generally good practice to move your systems as close to users as possible. (As mentioned pre‐ viously, this does not always directly correlate to physical location but to closest in network hops.)\n\nThe monitoring systems defined previously, combined with the dis‐ cussed performance and cost-optimization metrics, will allow you to determine when it is appropriate to consider moving to multiple cloud providers.\n\n25",

This solution is dependent on having a fully dynamic DNS provision that allows for very low TTLs on their domain names. (TTL—Time To Live—is the amount of time that a domain name resolution will be cached before it is requeried. Essen‐ tially, this will reflect the amount of time until a change in a DNS record will take effect for a user.) This allows for any change made at DNS level to be very quickly propagated to the wider Internet. The solution can be implemented manually when the situation is observed, though some DNS providers will provide systems as part of their solution to automate this failover.\n\nKey Concept—Uncouple Your DNS from Your Provider To take advantage of using multiple cloud providers, you need a good dynamic DNS provider. Many cloud providers provide DNS services, including anycast facilities; however, this only relates to their own services. If you want to span multiple cloud providers, it would be better to use an independent DNS provider. Good dynamic DNS providers will also allow for failover (either manually or automatically) at a DNS level.\n\nFlawed Thinking: Multicloud Has to Be Complex and Expensive While a multicloud approach does add additional complexity into your systems from a technical point of view (different technology stacks, different services to support, separate deployment methodol‐ ogies, multiple test processes, etc.) and also from a practical point of view (multiple management systems, financial arrangements, sup‐ port processes, etc.), it does not mean that you can’t design an intel‐ ligent system to minimize this complexity and optimize your infrastructure spending, thereby ensuring that your cost/perfor‐ mance ratio is in line with your business objectives.\n\n26\n\n| Phase 4: Maximizing Your Internet Performance: Building a Multicloud Solution\n\nPhase 4: Dos and Don’ts Do\n\nEnsure your DNS provider allows reducing of TTLs to very low values and that you validate the performance of your DNS pro‐ vision when TTLs are very low\n\nConsider using multiple cloud providers\n\nKeep your DNS provision independent of your cloud provider if you want to support multiple providers\n\nEnsure your DNS provider provides an anycast network to allow geographic optimization of traffic\n\nDon’t\n\nOverlook or overestimate the additional complexity and over‐ head in managing multiple cloud providers\n\nPhase 4: Dos and Don’ts\n\n|\n\n27\n\nConclusion\n\nThe journey to the cloud is not an easy one, but if done well, it can have many benefits.

      "content": "Optimizing Cloud Migration\n\nIntroducing the Trend: the Move to the Cloud Cloud services are redefining how many businesses are building and hosting their applications. Flexibility, scalability, cost reduction, and reduced overheads are just some of the reasons why the case for moving to the cloud is compelling to many businesses. This is a very real trend, with a 2015 survey reporting that 72% of executives sta‐ ted that the cloud was essential to their strategy, and 90% of busi‐ nesses reported using the cloud in some capacity.\n\nThis move is also accompanied by a move away from server-based solutions to a world of Software as a Service-based solutions—with modern applications increasingly moving toward being jigsaw puz‐ zles built from many different building blocks. Load balancing, file storage, databases, search, caching, authentication, data warehous‐ ing, microservices, APIs, media streaming, data processing, job queuing, and workflow are just some of the services available to build cloud-based applications. True cloud applications are funda‐ mentally different from traditional hosted applications, not just in how they are hosted, but in the nature of how they go about solving problems to deliver resilient and flexible solutions.\n\nThe promise of the cloud, therefore, is to enable you to build a sys‐ tem with levels of performance and availability that wouldn’t have been available to you when building an on-premise solution (at least without an investment of time and money that is beyond the scope of most companies). There are many challenges to achieving this, both practical and technological, but one area that is often over‐ looked is that of Internet performance.\n\n1",

Internet performance refers to the overhead of traversing the com‐ plex path of connectivity across the global Internet between the user’s ISP and the entry point to your company’s infrastructure. It is also sometimes referred to as the middle mile or backhaul.\n\nOptimizing Internet performance essentially involves optimizing the route that data takes to cross the public Internet and reach your sys‐ tems. This can range from understanding the routing that is in place between different locations, or serving content from different loca‐ tions based on the location of the user.\n\nTraditionally, this area of performance has been overlooked, as it is seen as being “out of our control.” However, in recent years there has been a growth in understanding from organizations that this perfor‐ mance is a representation of their brand, and it is irrelevant to the end user whether the degradation occurs inside or outside the com‐ pany’s network. This has led to a growth in demand from organiza‐ tions improve the visibility and control necessary performance of connectivity across their online infrastructure. To meet this demand, a range of tools known collectively as Internet Performance Management (IPM) tools have been created.\n\nfor\n\nto\n\nFlawed Thinking: You Can’t Control Internet Performance in the Cloud It is a mistake to think that because of the way cloud services are provided—as off-the-shelf services—you cannot take any control of Internet performance. In actual fact, the move to the cloud can potentially give you more control over the levels of Internet perfor‐ mance that you can deliver.\n\nThe geographically distributed nature of cloud platforms allows you more control over where you deliver content from. The possibility of using multiple clouds to dynamically serve users based on loca‐ tion further enhances this. However, optimizing Internet perfor‐\n\n2\n\n| Optimizing Cloud Migration",

There are obvious elements that should be considered when choosing a provider, such as reputation, services available, cost, and support. However, it is important that some consideration be given to the following aspects that have a major impact on Inter‐ net performance:\n\nGeographic distribution\n\nCloud providers are global platforms and portray themselves as such. In reality, however, their services are delivered from fewer than 20 geographical locations, which tend to congregate around certain areas of the world. This, of course, is more than the range of locations offered by the majority of data centers, but it is important to understand where these locations are and how that relates to the service you are wanting to provide. Per‐ formance is an important element of this alongside other con‐ siderations such as data sovereignty, redundancy, etc.\n\n5",

    {
      "page_number": 12,
      "content": "Routing\n\nThe geographical location is of course only part of the story. Cloud providers don’t own a worldwide network; they rely on transit providers to connect cloud locations to markets. So, it is also essential that the cloud provider has appropriate routing in and out of the geographical location. For example, if your users are in Indonesia, a cloud provider based in Singapore would seem appropriate, but that would be undermined if upon fur‐ ther investigation it turned out that they routed all traffic from Indonesia via Los Angeles. While it sounds absurd, this is a gen‐ uine example of the sort of routing that can exist, and similar examples are not uncommon.\n\nResiliency\n\nIt is important to understand the level of resiliency that is being offered in a particular cloud region. Cloud providers will pro‐ vide multiple physical data centers in a region and allow for automatic distribution of services across these data centers.\n\nKey Concept—The Nature of Buying Has Changed Previously, the buying process was about descriptions of the capa‐ bilities of service provision backed by service-level promises. ISPs would generally be open about the nature of connectivity they had in place and would be willing to work with you to improve that in bespoke ways if necessary.\n\nCloud providers are typically very reticent about sharing any details of the nature and levels of resilience they have in connectivity, focusing their SLAs on the services that they provide rather than the level of connectivity to specific markets. This is partly because it is not part of their stated services and partly because they cannot own or control the entire path to every market. This leaves the responsibility for ensuring the level and quality of connectivity with you. It is essential, therefore, that you put effective monitoring in place (see “4. Build a Comprehensive Monitoring Solution” on page 15).\n\nUnderstanding the nature of the geographic distribution of cloud providers enables you to start making an informed choice about which will be the best provider for your service to minimize latency (of course, latency will only be one element considered when decid‐\n\n6\n\n| Phase 1: Preparing for Your Journey to the Cloud",

      "content": "ing the appropriate cloud provider). A good starting point for this is to look at the region that is geographically nearest; however, that region may not actually be the best option. It is essential that you also consider the peering arrangements that the cloud provider has in place, and therefore the routing that will actually occur between your users and the cloud location.\n\nCloud providers often don’t have the most optimized routing between end users and their systems, so it is crucial to test this as much as possible up front to select the best locations. It’s even more important to continue monitoring this after the systems are in use by the public. IPM tools are core to your ability to understand the impact of cloud geography and topology on your users.\n\nBefore starting your journey to the cloud, it’s important to under‐ stand what the exact nature of the cloud is.\n\nFlawed Thinking: The Cloud Is Just Another Data Center It is easy to think of the cloud as simply a replacement data center with on-demand virtual machines. For many people, the first instinct is to just “lift and shift” their existing infrastructure to a cloud provider. This approach often results in disillusionment with the cloud, as it results in emphasis of the negative without taking advantage of the positives that the cloud has to offer.\n\nThe real benefits of the cloud are in its dynamic nature, the ability to create and destroy infrastructure on demand, the ability to use the scalable services, the ability to create geographically distributed sys‐ tems, etc. If you are just creating a fixed number of servers with installed software, then you are likely building a system that is less reliable and possibly more expensive than that provided by a tradi‐ tional data center.\n\nIt is often said that servers within data centers are like pets, whereas within the cloud (or other virtualized platforms) they are like cattle (a phrase that’s widely used but I think was originally coined by Randy Bias).\n\nThat is, when creating a system in a data center, you can:\n\nCarefully craft a system to meet your exact requirements\n\nFlawed Thinking: The Cloud Is Just Another Data Center\n\n|\n\n7",

You select from a range of offerings that are predefined and build your systems on top of them. The servers become throwaway; if there are any problems or if your requirements change, they are destroyed and new ones created. To those with an on-premise mindset, this can seem very limiting. However, when exercised to full advantage, the cloud can be incredibly powerful and liberating.\n\nFlawed Thinking: The Cloud Is Not Just Another Data Center As flawed as it is to view the cloud as just another data center, con‐ versely, it is just as wrong to start thinking of cloud providers as being something more than data centers.\n\nWhile the way cloud providers run their operations and the nature of the services they provide are very different from a traditional data center, it is important to remember that ultimately, they are just data centers. When you drill down to the core, they are simply buildings full of racks and servers with connectivity to the Internet. They face exactly the same challenges as those faced by traditional data cen‐ ters.\n\nWhen considering Internet performance, this is an essential point to remember. Cloud providers connect to the Internet in just the same manner as any other provider. Also, like any other provider, the nature of that connectivity is driven by many factors, including practical, economic, and political ones, as well as performance. The varying levels of importance given to these considerations are of course a business decision.\n\nCurrently, Internet performance is not something that cloud provid‐ ers use as a selling point; they typically sell more on price and func‐\n\n8\n\n| Phase 1: Preparing for Your Journey to the Cloud",

Your finished applica‐ tion may even span multiple cloud providers in addition to interact‐ ing with on-premise and other third-party systems.\n\nObviously, the distributed nature of systems provides additional challenges for Internet performance, and it is important that you understand some core pieces of information related to your applica‐ tion.

Start Small and Gradually Migrate Systems Any rollout to the cloud should be completed as a gradual transi‐ tion, moving the lower-risk or biggest-win areas first while having systems that communicate back to your on-premise solution. Typically, legacy applications and data migration are the highest-risk areas, so the aim should be to create cloud-based services that miti‐ gate their risks. For example, the first phase may be to create an API in the cloud that provides access to data from an on-premise data‐ base—cloud-based data caching services can be used to deliver data returned from the API. Typically, this could be targeted at a specific region to evaluate the Internet performance. You can then gradually extend that cloud-based data provision until it eventually ends up not needing to communicate back to the source database at all. It is\n\n11",

Test, Test, Test—Prove Everything Before Committing to the Move The nature of the cloud is that everything is throwaway, you pay for what you use, and you can scale up and down at will. This allows you to try things out, see the reality of the situation, fail fast, and then move on. The systems you test on can also be completely live- like, giving the opportunity to do some full-performance testing. The benefits of this for functional correctness are well documented, but the impact on Internet performance is in some ways more important. It allows you to fire up systems, run tests from dis‐ tributed geographical locations, and monitor the Internet perfor‐ mance.\n\nThe important takeaway here is that if there are issues, you can raise them with the provider. It’s likely that the provider won’t be able to do anything about those issues, but the nature of the engagement allows you to walk away and investigate alternatives. It also allows for an A/B type release, gradually releasing the systems to subsets of users to determine whether the testing you have done is still valid with those real users.\n\nHaving proved the concept after testing shouldn’t end the testing. After migration to the cloud, ongoing testing (either explicit testing or by validating real-world performance via monitoring) should take place to ensure that the solution is still optimal. Moving a cloud system into production doesn’t necessarily require a long-term com‐ mitment or mean that that platform is set in stone—if it is not meet‐ ing requirements, then it should be modified. Don’t be afraid to move clouds.\n\n12\n\n| Phase 2: Beginning Your Journey to the Cloud",

Understand Your Performance Expectations Unless the specific goal of the migration is to realize performance improvements, it is likely that the performance of the system after migration is only required to match the existing system’s perfor‐ mance (though obviously any performance improvements would be gratefully received). Therefore, before migrating anything to the cloud, it is essential that you understand the nature of your applica‐ tion’s performance as it currently exists. The following four-stage process is good practice for identifying any application performance standards, but it applies equally when looking specifically at Internet performance:\n\nStage 1: Define a performance vision for the application\n\nThis will describe the nature of good performance for your sys‐ tem at a conceptual level, defining which elements of perfor‐ mance are important to your business. If this has already been defined for the existing solution, it will remain the same for the migrated solution.\n\nStage 2: Understand the nature of the system\n\nMake sure you are aware of the nature of the system you are migrating by answering the following key questions:\n\nWhat are the high-risk areas? What areas of the system are most prone to poor performance, or what areas are impac‐ ted the most by poor performance? For example, for an ecommerce site, a product page is an area where poor per‐ formance has a particularly large impact because it directly reduces sales. Equally, it could be that product search was a high-risk area because it was an area where performance had previously been seen to be negatively impacted by change.\n\nWhich areas currently have performance issues? What is the cause of those issues? Are there particular areas that have been identified as triggering poor performance? For example, it could be that high CPU usage on your database server causes poor performance, affecting the reliability of the integration to your accounts system.\n\nWhat is the impact of poor performance on the user, the business, and on other systems? Do users stop using the system when poor performance hits, or do they get mal‐\n\n3. Understand Your Performance Expectations\n\n|\n\n13",

Does poor performance result in other systems within the orga‐ nization experiencing issues? For example, does your sys‐ tem running slowly impact the ability of the warehousing system to correctly process orders?\n\nUnderstanding the impact allows the creation of a risk-based assessment of the importance of performance on all areas of the system.\n\nStage 3: Understand the characteristics of the end users\n\nIt is essential when migrating a system to the cloud that you understand the system’s end users. Very important when con‐ sidering Internet performance is the users’ geographic location, but it is also important to understand:\n\nThe type of people they are (as this reflects their tolerance for poor performance). For example, tech-savvy customers who have the opportunity to buy the same product else‐ where will likely be intolerant of poor performance. On the other hand, users of an internal system for non-urgent busi‐ ness tasks will tend to be much more tolerant of poor per‐ formance.\n\nThe types of system and connectivity they will be using (e.g., desktop or mobile). Mobile performance is impacted by a much wider set of issues than just the server perfor‐ mance (e.g., network latency, poor connectivity, or device performance). It is important that you understand the vary‐ ing impact of your performance on these types of users as opposed to high-speed broadband desktop users if they make up a significant element of your users.\n\nAlso remember that end users may actually be other systems (your own or third parties) that your system under migration interacts with.\n\nStage 4: Define acceptance criteria/KPIs for performance\n\nCompleting this analysis allows the creation of acceptance KPIs that can be used as the basis of proof-of-concept tests when evaluating cloud providers/solutions. These will then flow through into validation testing after migration is complete.\n\n14\n\n| Phase 2: Beginning Your Journey to the Cloud",

The infrastructure, latency, and network connectivity between all these elements are generally out of your control.\n\nWhen evaluating performance, it is perfectly valid to set targets for specific individual elements where possible, but it is essential that you start setting targets for the full end-to-end process to under‐ stand the impact of this dispersal of functionality to systems outside your direct control.\n\n4. Build a Comprehensive Monitoring Solution Cloud providers will give you access to a lot of information about their systems via extensive and configurable dashboards. These are an excellent resource and should form an integral part of your sys‐ tem health monitoring; however, they only tell part of the story. Cloud provider dashboards are only focused on the elements of the system that they are providing, which leaves some important gaps:\n\nThe performance and behaviors within your application (APM)\n\nThe experience actually being had by end users (EUM)\n\nThe Internet performance of your application (IPM)\n\nThese gaps can leave you in a situation where all your cloud dash‐ boards are green, but your system is unavailable. The dashboards are not designed for in-depth or worldwide reporting. It is impor‐ tant then that your monitoring is based on how your application is performing, not how the server is performing.

APM tooling is also important for under‐ standing the impact of third-party dependencies on the perfor‐ mance of your application.\n\nUser Experience Monitoring The objective of this type of monitoring is to reflect what your user is actually seeing. There are two models for this type of monitoring: Real User Monitoring (RUM) and End User Monitoring (EUM).\n\nRUM gathers data from all user activity and passes that data back to a central collection server (typically by injecting a snippet of Java‐ Script into every page), which allows for analysis of your users’ exact experience. This will flag any unexpected behavior and can help you drill down to identify the cause of the problem. RUM is also useful for determining whether there is a pattern to the types of users who are experiencing a particular problem.\n\nEUM is similar, but relies on synthetically generated, regularly repeated tests of specific functionality. EUM will quickly show if tasks are varying over time and whether key functionality is still act‐ ing as expected.\n\nA good monitoring solution will combine elements of both models.\n\nEnd-to-End Transaction Monitoring In recent years, APM products have shifted their focus to also look at the end-to-end breakdown of a user request, giving an under‐ standing of what the user has experienced within the browser (including the performance of client-side scripts) and allowing the tracing of that same request right through your application. This incorporates APM and EUM in a single solution.\n\nThis is a very valuable set of tooling, providing a deep view into end-to-end performance on an aggregated basis (by type, location, or technology of user). These tools are also able to drill down into specific outliers to determine the cause of issues.\n\nNetwork Performance Monitoring While RUM and EUM give you a good understanding of what the end user is experiencing and APM illustrates what’s going on on\n\n16\n\n| Phase 2: Beginning Your Journey to the Cloud",

(It’s worth noting that these two types of tools are increasingly over‐ lapping.)\n\nThe network infrastructure is largely hidden from you in cloud environments, but NPM is still an important tool if you are using a hybrid cloud approach that combines cloud services with on- premise applications.\n\nInternet Performance Management Despite the standard monitoring tools described so far, there still remains a visibility gap, even when providing end-to-end monitor‐ ing, as it has limited insight into the Internet performance of your system. This is where IPM tooling can be valuable.\n\nIPM tooling (such as Dyn Internet Intelligence) is designed to give you insight into the behavior of the connectivity between your users and cloud providers—the middle mile or backhaul. This is shown in terms of both availability and performance, which allows you to determine whether users are being impacted by connectivity or routing issues with a cloud provider and take action to mitigate it.\n\nKey Concept—Monitoring Must Become Dynamic In a traditional environment, adding a server to a monitoring solu‐ tion was often a manual process included as part of the rollout.\n\nIn the cloud world, you are living in a dynamic, ever-changing environment where servers and other services may well be added and removed at any time.

The ability to dynamically create infrastructure on demand removes the dependency on hardware that is characteristic of data centers.\n\nEverything you do in the cloud should assume failure will happen.\n\nThis is now a common practice for server infrastructure. The most famous example is Netflix’s Chaos Monkey: a tool that goes around intentionally disabling elements of the infrastructure to ensure that their resiliency systems can cope. This is rarely done at the network level, but the same rules can apply.\n\nIf your system suffers Internet performance problems, such as rout‐ ing issues that add overhead onto every request, then your system should be aware of this and be able to easily switch to another loca‐ tion. For example, if you normally serve content from Virginia because the majority of your requests come from users in Chicago, then in the event of Internet performance issues, it should be easy to switch to serving content from another relevant location, such as San Francisco.

Alternatively, rather than switching location—as this is not always possible due to practical issues (e.g., data)—the system could also be configured to move into a lower-bandwidth/minimized-service interaction state to minimize the impact.\n\nUnderstand the Cost of Performance and Monitoring as a Core Part of Capacity Planning The cloud allows you to provide all the systems needed to deliver a scalable system, but those systems do not come for free. Anyone who has used cloud-based services will tell you that it is very easy to run up much higher bills than expected. However, this can be miti‐ gated by intelligent system design.\n\nKey Concept—Capacity Planning Has Changed Capacity planning used to be about understanding the capacity of your systems and ensuring that there was always sufficient head‐ room to allow for anticipated short/medium-term growth. In this model, a server hitting capacity was a negative position that indica‐ ted that capacity planning was failing and that the system may soon fail.\n\nIn the cloud world, this is reversed, and the objective should be to have a system that is always operating close to capacity. Resources are so easy to scale that scaling them ahead of time is generally a waste of money.\n\nAdding complexity will add cost—not only in terms of cloud costs, but also in terms of development and maintenance overhead. It is essential that you consider the following:\n\nLevel of usage\n\nScale systems only to the level of usage that you anticipate. There is no need to future-proof systems. You build systems that can scale, not that are at a capacity to meet any anticipated future demand. Good system architecture is essential here and, like other things, cloud-based system architecture is different from on-premise system architecture. As a general rule, the aim should be to use cloud-based services where possible, as they\n\n20\n\n| Phase 3: Enhancing Your Cloud Solution",

Building and maintaining a multiregion system is a complex task, partic‐ ularly when it comes to data management, so it is not some‐ thing that should be entered into lightly. Before committing, use your monitoring to determine if there is sufficient demand from the region and, more importantly, what the impact is on users of the configuration that you have in place.\n\nWhen your users are coming\n\nThe nature of cloud systems, with their “pay as you use” charg‐ ing method and on-demand creation and destruction of resour‐ ces, means that you can scale your system up and down as needed. It is therefore best practice to analyze when your sys‐ tems are busy and scale up to meet demand and back down again afterwards. This can be on a daily, hourly, or even minute- by-minute basis.\n\nHow tolerant your users are\n\nWith an intelligent set of monitoring tools, you can determine how tolerant your users are of performance issues. For example, you may determine that users in Australia see performance that is notably worse than that seen by users in other areas of the world, which could trigger a need to invest in expanding to cloud providers with better Internet performance for Australian users. However, before making such an investment, it is a good idea to understand the impact that poor performance is having on those users. There are a couple of ways to investigate this: you could analyze the performance of your competitors to see how well you compare in that area, or alternatively, you could change performance and assess the impact. Improving perfor‐ mance is typically a complex task, so one option is to con‐ sciously reduce performance on your system to see the business impact. This may seem like an unusual suggestion, and it may be hard to sell within your business, but, while obviously not foolproof, it can be a quick and effective method of determining\n\nUnderstand the Cost of Performance and Monitoring as a Core Part of Capacity Planning\n\n|\n\n21",

However, like everything else, the cost of building and maintaining this system must be included when considering the cost optimization. In other words, don’t spend six months of time building a system that will save the equivalent of one month of time in reduced cloud costs.\n\nKey Concept—How Cloud Providers Sell Networking When dealing with data centers, network provision is usually sold as a pipe into your environment. This pipe typically has a limit but with an element of bursting available. Beyond this level, throughput is usually throttled. Each machine in the environment will then have a networking card, which will have a limit to the amount of throughput it can handle. The level of this throughput will be defined as part of the hardware definition of the machine.\n\nCloud providers, however, sell networking differently. They usually offer unlimited throughput into your environment, charged by the byte (or GB). Therefore, the limiting factor is now the infrastruc‐ ture that you run your application on, rather than the pipe into your environment.\n\nHowever, cloud providers are often limited in the information they provide about the networking capabilities of their machines, and will give high-level views such as S, M, or L, with the size determin‐ ing the size of the elements within the machine (memory, CPU, etc.), as well as the level of networking that it provides. Therefore, high-throughput but low-CPU/memory systems such as load bal‐ ancers can often end up having to be run on much beefier machines than expected to stop hitting the networking limits of the device. This can have a sizable impact on cost when sizing a new system.\n\nHowever, as you look to optimize your cloud service, there are a few common mistakes that can undermine your efforts.\n\n22\n\n| Phase 3: Enhancing Your Cloud Solution",

Manag‐ ing a cloud-based system is as complex as managing an on-premise system. It requires a high level of specialized knowledge and under‐ standing of the implementation, as well as industry knowledge in both traditional networking and cloud systems. Cloud systems do not look after themselves, but they do provide a new paradigm in how to build, monitor, and maintain these systems. This requires as much expertise and management as on-premise systems.\n\nBecause little pre-emptive optimization of the core infrastructure can be done, the focus becomes more on building fault tolerance into systems, building comprehensive monitoring solutions, and the ability to react quickly to situations to take advantage of the scaling and geographical options offered by cloud-based services.
