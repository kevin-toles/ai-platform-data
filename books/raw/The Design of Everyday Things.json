It is intended to be enjoy-\nable and informative for everyone: everyday people, technical peo-\nple, designers, and nondesigners. One goal is to turn readers into \ngreat observers of the absurd, of the poor design that gives rise \nto so many of the problems of modern life, especially of modern \ntechnology. It will also turn them into observers of the good, of \nthe ways in which thoughtful designers have worked to make our \nlives easier and smoother. Good design is actually a lot harder to \nnotice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs \nso well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing \nattention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its \ninadequacies, making itself very noticeable.\nAlong the way I lay out the fundamental principles required \nto eliminate problems, to turn our everyday stuff into enjoyable \nproducts that provide pleasure and satisfaction. The combination \nof good observation skills and good design principles is a powerful \n\n\nxii \nPreface to the Revised Edition\ntool, one that everyone can use, even people who are not profes-\nsional designers. Why? Because we are all designers in the sense \nthat all of us deliberately design our lives, our rooms, and the way \nwe do things. We can also design workarounds, ways of overcom-\ning the flaws of existing devices. So, one purpose of this book is to \ngive back your control over the products in your life: to know how \nto select usable and understandable ones, to know how to fix those \nthat aren’t so usable or understandable.\nThe first edition of the book has lived a long and healthy life. Its \nname was quickly changed to Design of Everyday Things (DOET) \nto make the title less cute and more descriptive. DOET has been \nread by the general public and by designers. It has been assigned \nin courses and handed out as required readings in many compa-\nnies. Now, more than twenty years after its release, the book is \nstill popular. I am delighted by the response and by the number \nof people who correspond with me about it, who send me further \nexamples of thoughtless, inane design, plus occasional examples \nof superb design. Many readers have told me that it has changed \ntheir lives, making them more sensitive to the problems of life and \nto the needs of people. Some changed their careers and became \ndesigners because of the book. The response has been amazing.\nWhy a Revised Edition?\nIn the twenty-five years that have passed since the first edition \nof the book, technology has undergone massive change. Neither \ncell phones nor the Internet were in widespread usage when I \nwrote the book. Home networks were unheard of. Moore’s law \nproclaims that the power of computer processors doubles roughly \nevery two years. This means that today’s computers are five thou-\nsand times more powerful than the ones available when the book \nwas first written.\nAlthough the fundamental design principles of The Design of \nEveryday Things are still as true and as important as when the first \nedition was written, the examples were badly out of date. “What \nis a slide projector?” students ask. Even if nothing else was to be \nchanged, the examples had to be updated.\n\n\n \nPreface to the Revised Edition xiii\nThe principles of effective design also had to be brought up to \ndate. Human-centered design (HCD) has emerged since the first \nedition, partially inspired by that book. This current edition has \nan entire chapter devoted to the HCD process of product devel-\nopment. The first edition of the book focused upon making prod-\nucts understandable and usable. The total experience of a product \ncovers much more than its usability: aesthetics, pleasure, and fun \nplay critically important roles. There was no discussion of plea-\nsure, enjoyment, or emotion. Emotion is so important that I wrote \nan entire book, Emotional Design, about the role it plays in design. \nThese issues are also now included in this edition.\nMy experiences in industry have taught me about the com-\nplexities of the real world, how cost and schedules are critical, \nthe need to pay attention to competition, and the importance of \nmulti disciplinary teams. I learned that the successful product has \nto appeal to customers, and the criteria they use to determine what \nto purchase may have surprisingly little overlap with the aspects \nthat are important during usage. The best products do not always \nsucceed. Brilliant new technologies might take decades to become \naccepted. To understand products, it is not enough to understand \ndesign or technology: it is critical to understand business.\nWhat Has Changed?\nFor readers familiar with the earlier edition of this book, here is a \nbrief review of the changes.\nWhat has changed? Not much. Everything.\nWhen I started, I assumed that the basic principles were still \ntrue, so all I needed to do was update the examples. But in the \nend, I rewrote everything. Why? Because although all the princi-\nples still applied, in the twenty-five years since the first edition, \nmuch has been learned. I also now know which parts were diffi-\ncult and therefore need better explanations. In the interim, I also \nwrote many articles and six books on related topics, some of which \nI thought important to include in the revision. For example, the \noriginal book says nothing of what has come to be called user \nexperience (a term that I was among the first to use, when in the \n\n\nxiv Preface to the Revised Edition\nearly 1990s, the group I headed at Apple called itself “the User \nExperience Architect’s Office”). This needed to be here.\nFinally, my exposure to industry taught me much about the way \nproducts actually get deployed, so I added considerable infor-\nmation about the impact of budgets, schedules, and competitive \npressures. When I wrote the original book, I was an academic re-\nsearcher. Today, I have been an industry executive (Apple, HP, and \nsome startups), a consultant to numerous companies, and a board \nmember of companies. I had to include my learnings from these \nexperiences.\nFinally, one important component of the original edition was \nits brevity. The book could be read quickly as a basic, general \nintroduction. I kept that feature unchanged. I tried to delete as \nmuch as I added to keep the total size about the same (I failed). \nThe book is meant to be an introduction: advanced discussions of \nthe topics, as well as a large number of important but more ad-\nvanced topics, have been left out to maintain the compactness. The \nprevious edition lasted from 1988 to 2013. If the new edition is to \nlast as long, 2013 to 2038, I had to be careful to choose examples \nthat would not be dated twenty-five years from now. As a result, \nI have tried not to give specific company examples. After all, who \nremembers the companies of twenty-five years ago? Who can \npredict what new companies will arise, what existing companies \nwill disappear, and what new technologies will arise in the next \ntwenty-five years? The one thing I can predict with certainty is that \nthe principles of human psychology will remain the same, which \nmeans that the design principles here, based on psychology, on the \nnature of human cognition, emotion, action, and interaction with \nthe world, will remain unchanged.\nHere is a brief summary of the changes, chapter by chapter.\nChapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things\nSignifiers are the most important addition to the chapter, a con-\ncept first introduced in my book Living with Complexity. The first \nedition had a focus upon affordances, but although affordances \n\n\n \nPreface to the Revised Edition \nxv\nmake sense for interaction with physical objects, they are con-\nfusing when dealing with virtual ones. As a result, affordances \nhave created much confusion in the world of design. Affor-\ndances define what actions are possible. Signifiers specify how \npeople discover those possibilities: signifiers are signs, percep-\ntible signals of what can be done. Signifiers are of far more im-\nportance to designers than are affordances. Hence, the extended \ntreatment.\nI added a very brief section on HCD, a term that didn’t yet exist \nwhen the first edition was published, although looking back, we \nsee that the entire book was about HCD.\nOther than that, the chapter is the same, and although all the \nphotographs and drawings are new, the examples are pretty much \nthe same.\nChapter 2: The Psychology of Everyday Actions\nThe chapter has one major addition to the coverage in the first edi-\ntion: the addition of emotion. The seven-stage model of action has \nproven to be influential, as has the three-level model of processing \n(introduced in my book Emotional Design). In this chapter I show \nthe interplay between these two, show that different emotions \narise at the different stages, and show which stages are primarily \nlocated at each of the three levels of processing (visceral, for the \nelementary levels of motor action performance and perception; be-\nhavioral, for the levels of action specification and initial interpre-\ntation of the outcome; and reflective, for the development of goals, \nplans, and the final stage of evaluation of the outcome).\nChapter 3: Knowledge in the Head and in the World\nAside from improved and updated examples, the most important \naddition to this chapter is a section on culture, which is of special \nimportance to my discussion of “natural mappings.” What seems \nnatural in one culture may not be in another. The section examines \nthe way different cultures view time—the discussion might sur-\nprise you.\n\n\nxvi Preface to the Revised Edition\nChapter. 4: Knowing What to Do: \nConstraints, Discoverability, and Feedback\nFew substantive changes. Better examples. The elaboration of forc-\ning functions into two kinds: lock-in and lockout. And a section \non destination control elevators, illustrating how change can be \nextremely disconcerting, even to professionals, even if the change \nis for the better.\nChapter 5: Human Error? No, Bad Design\nThe basics are unchanged, but the chapter itself has been heavily \nrevised. I update the classification of errors to fit advances since \nthe publication of the first edition. In particular, I now divide slips \ninto two main categories—action-based and memory lapses; and \nmistakes into three categories—rule-based, knowledge-based, \nand memory lapses. (These distinctions are now common, but I \nintroduce a slightly different way to treat memory lapses.)\nAlthough the multiple classifications of slips provided in the \nfirst edition are still valid, many have little or no implications for \ndesign, so they have been eliminated from the revision. I provide \nmore design-relevant examples. I show the relationship of the clas-\nsification of errors, slips, and mistakes to the seven-stage model of \naction, something new in this revision.\nThe chapter concludes with a quick discussion of the difficulties \nposed by automation (from my book The Design of Future Things) \nand what I consider the best new approach to deal with design \nso as to either eliminate or minimize human error: resilience \nengineering.\nChapter 6: Design Thinking\nThis chapter is completely new. I discuss two views of human-\ncentered design: the British Design Council’s double-diamond \nmodel and the traditional HCD iteration of observation, ide-\nation, prototyping, and testing. The first diamond is the diver-\ngence, followed by convergence, of possibilities to determine \nthe appropriate problem. The second diamond is a divergence-\nconvergence to determine an appropriate solution. I introduce \n\n\n \nPreface to the Revised Edition xvii\nactivity-centered design as a more appropriate variant of human-\ncentered design in many circumstances. These sections cover \nthe theory.\nThe chapter then takes a radical shift in position, starting with a \nsection entitled “What I Just Told You? It Doesn’t Really Work That \nWay.” Here is where I introduce Norman’s Law: The day the prod-\nuct team is announced, it is behind schedule and over its budget.\nI discuss challenges of design within a company, where sched-\nules, budgets, and the competing requirements of the different \ndivisions all provide severe constraints upon what can be accom-\nplished. Readers from industry have told me that they welcome \nthese sections, which capture the real pressures upon them.\nThe chapter concludes with a discussion of the role of standards \n(modified from a similar discussion in the earlier edition), plus \nsome more general design guidelines.\nChapter 7: Design in the World of Business\nThis chapter is also completely new, continuing the theme started \nin Chapter 6 of design in the real world. Here I discuss “featuritis,” \nthe changes being forced upon us through the invention of new \ntechnologies, and the distinction between incremental and radical \ninnovation. Everyone wants radical innovation, but the truth is, \nmost radical innovations fail, and even when they do succeed, it \ncan take multiple decades before they are accepted. Radical innova-\ntion, therefore, is relatively rare: incremental innovation is common.\nThe techniques of human-centered design are appropriate to in-\ncremental innovation: they cannot lead to radical innovations.\nThe chapter concludes with discussions of the trends to come, \nthe future of books, the moral obligations of design, and the rise of \nsmall, do-it-yourself makers that are starting to revolutionize the \nway ideas are conceived and introduced into the marketplace: \n“the rise of the small,” I call it.\nSummary\nWith the passage of time, the psychology of people stays the same, \nbut the tools and objects in the world change. Cultures change. \n\n\nxviii Preface to the Revised Edition\nTechnologies change. The principles of design still hold, but the \nway they get applied needs to be modified to account for new ac-\ntivities, new technologies, new methods of communication and \ninteraction. The Psychology of Everyday Things was appropriate for \nthe twentieth century: The Design of Everyday Things is for the \ntwenty-first.\nDon Norman\nSilicon Valley, California\nwww.jnd.org\n\n\n \n \n1\nTHE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY \nOF EVERYDAY \nTHINGS\nIf I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, \nmy inability to perform well would neither surprise nor \nbother me. But why should I have trouble with doors \nand light switches, water faucets and stoves? “Doors?” I \ncan hear the reader saying. “You have trouble opening doors?” Yes. \nI push doors that are meant to be pulled, pull doors that should be \npushed, and walk into doors that neither pull nor push, but slide. \nMoreover, I see others having the same troubles—unnecessary \ntroubles. My problems with doors have become so well known \nthat confusing doors are often called “Norman doors.” Imagine \nbecoming famous for doors that don’t work right. I’m pretty sure \nthat’s not what my parents planned for me. (Put “Norman doors” \ninto your favorite search engine—be sure to include the quote \nmarks: it makes for fascinating reading.)\nHow can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door \nwould seem to be about as simple a device as possible. There is not \nmuch you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it. Suppose you \nare in an office building, walking down a corridor. You come to a \ndoor. How does it open? Should you push or pull, on the left or the \nright? Maybe the door slides. If so, in which direction? I have seen \ndoors that slide to the left, to the right, and even up into the ceiling. \nC H A P T E R  O N E\n",

The entrance was an imposing row \nof six glass swinging doors, followed immediately by a second, \nidentical row. That’s a standard design: it helps reduce the airflow \nand thus maintain the indoor temperature of the building. There \nwas no visible hardware: obviously the doors could swing in ei-\nther direction: all a person had to do was push the side of the door \nand enter.\nMy friend pushed on one of the outer doors. It swung inward, \nand he entered the building. Then, before he could get to the next \nrow of doors, he was distracted and turned around for an instant. \nHe didn’t realize it at the time, but he had moved slightly to the \nright. So when he came to the next door and pushed it, nothing \nhappened. “Hmm,” he thought, “must be locked.” So he pushed \nthe side of the adjacent door. Nothing. Puzzled, my friend decided \nto go outside again. He turned around and pushed against the \nside of a door. Nothing. He pushed the adjacent door. Nothing. \nThe door he had just entered no longer worked. He turned around \nonce more and tried the inside doors again. Nothing. Concern, \nthen mild panic. He was trapped! Just then, a group of people on \nthe other side of the entranceway (to my friend’s right) passed eas-\nily through both sets of doors. My friend hurried over to follow \ntheir path.\nFIGURE 1.1. Coffeepot for Masochists. The \nFrench artist Jacques Carelman in his series of \nbooks Catalogue d’objets introuvables (Catalog of \nunfindable objects) provides delightful examples \nof everyday things that are deliberately unwork-\nable, outrageous, or otherwise ill-formed. One \nof my favorite items is what he calls “coffeepot for \nmasochists.” The photograph shows a copy given \nto me by collegues at the University of California, \nSan Diego. It is one of my treasured art objects. \n(Photograph by Aymin Shamma for the author.)\n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n3\nHow could such a thing happen? A swinging door has two sides. \nOne contains the supporting pillar and the hinge, the other is un-\nsupported. To open the door, you must push or pull on the unsup-\nported edge. If you push on the hinge side, nothing happens. In \nmy friend’s case, he was in a building where the designer aimed \nfor beauty, not utility. No distracting lines, no visible pillars, no vis-\nible hinges. So how can the ordinary user know which side to push \non? While distracted, my friend had moved toward the (invisible) \nsupporting pillar, so he was pushing the doors on the hinged side. \nNo wonder nothing happened. Attractive doors. Stylish. Probably \nwon a design prize.\nTwo of the most important characteristics of good design are dis-\ncoverability and understanding. Discoverability: Is it possible to even \nfigure out what actions are possible and where and how to per-\nform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the \nproduct supposed to be used? What do all the different controls \nand settings mean?\nThe doors in the story illustrate what happens when discoverabil-\nity fails. Whether the device is a door or a stove, a mobile phone \nor a nuclear power plant, the relevant components must be visible, \nand they must communicate the correct message: What actions \nare possible? Where and how should they be done? With doors \nthat push, the designer must provide signals that naturally indi-\ncate where to push. These need not destroy the aesthetics. Put a \nvertical plate on the side to be pushed. Or make the supporting \npillars visible. The vertical plate and supporting pillars are natural \nsignals, naturally interpreted, making it easy to know just what to \ndo: no labels needed.\nWith complex devices, discoverability and understanding re-\nquire the aid of manuals or personal instruction. We accept this \nif the device is indeed complex, but it should be unnecessary for \nsimple things. Many products defy understanding simply because \nthey have too many functions and controls. I don’t think that sim-\nple home appliances—stoves, washing machines, audio and tele-\nvision sets—should look like Hollywood’s idea of a spaceship \ncontrol room. They already do, much to our consternation. Faced \n\n\n4 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nwith a bewildering array of controls and displays, we simply mem-\norize one or two fixed settings to approximate what is desired.\nIn England I visited a home with a fancy new Italian washer-\ndryer combination, with super-duper multisymbol controls, all to \ndo everything anyone could imagine doing with the washing and \ndrying of clothes. The husband (an engineering psychologist) said \nhe refused to go near it. The wife (a physician) said she had simply \nmemorized one setting and tried to ignore the rest. I asked to see \nthe manual: it was just as confusing as the device. The whole pur-\npose of the design is lost.\nThe Complexity of Modern Devices\nAll artificial things are designed. Whether it is the layout of fur-\nniture in a room, the paths through a garden or forest, or the in-\ntricacies of an electronic device, some person or group of people \nhad to decide upon the layout, operation, and mechanisms. Not \nall designed things involve physical structures. Services, lectures, \nrules and procedures, and the organizational structures of busi-\nnesses and governments do not have physical mechanisms, but \ntheir rules of operation have to be designed, sometimes informally, \nsometimes precisely recorded and specified.\nBut even though people have designed things since prehistoric \ntimes, the field of design is relatively new, divided into many areas \nof specialty. Because everything is designed, the number of areas is \nenormous, ranging from clothes and furniture to complex control \nrooms and bridges. This book covers everyday things, focusing on \nthe interplay between technology and people to ensure that the \nproducts actually fulfill human needs while being understand-\nable and usable. In the best of cases, the products should also be \ndelightful and enjoyable, which means that not only must the re-\nquirements of engineering, manufacturing, and ergonomics be sat-\nisfied, but attention must be paid to the entire experience, which \nmeans the aesthetics of form and the quality of interaction. The \nmajor areas of design relevant to this book are industrial design, \ninteraction design, and experience design. None of the fields is \nwell defined, but the focus of the efforts does vary, with industrial \n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n5\ndesigners emphasizing form and material, interactive designers \nemphasizing understandability and usability, and experience de-\nsigners emphasizing the emotional impact. Thus:\nIndustrial design: The professional service of creating and developing \nconcepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and \nappearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both \nuser and manufacturer (from the Industrial Design Society of America’s \nwebsite).\nInteraction design: The focus is upon how people interact with tech-\nnology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be \ndone, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction de-\nsign draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion \nto ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.\nExperience design: The practice of designing products, processes, ser-\nvices, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality \nand enjoyment of the total experience.\nDesign is concerned with how things work, how they are con-\ntrolled, and the nature of the interaction between people and \ntechnology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable \nproducts. When done badly, the products are unusable, leading to \ngreat frustration and irritation. Or they might be usable, but force \nus to behave the way the product wishes rather than as we wish.\nMachines, after all, are conceived, designed, and constructed by \npeople. By human standards, machines are pretty limited. They \ndo not maintain the same kind of rich history of experiences that \npeople have in common with one another, experiences that enable \nus to interact with others because of this shared understanding. \nInstead, machines usually follow rather simple, rigid rules of be-\nhavior. If we get the rules wrong even slightly, the machine does \nwhat it is told, no matter how insensible and illogical. People are \nimaginative and creative, filled with common sense; that is, a lot of \nvaluable knowledge built up over years of experience. But instead \nof capitalizing on these strengths, machines require us to be precise \nand accurate, things we are not very good at. Machines have no \n\n\n6 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nleeway or common sense. Moreover, many of the rules followed \nby a machine are known only by the machine and its designers.\nWhen people fail to follow these bizarre, secret rules, and the \nmachine does the wrong thing, its operators are blamed for not \nunderstanding the machine, for not following its rigid specifica-\ntions. With everyday objects, the result is frustration. With complex \ndevices and commercial and industrial processes, the resulting \ndifficulties can lead to accidents, injuries, and even deaths. It is \ntime to reverse the situation: to cast the blame upon the machines \nand their design. It is the machine and its design that are at fault. It \nis the duty of machines and those who design them to understand \npeople. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless \ndictates of machines.\nThe reasons for the deficiencies in human-machine interaction \nare numerous. Some come from the limitations of today’s technol-\nogy. Some come from self-imposed restrictions by the designers, \noften to hold down cost. But most of the problems come from a \ncomplete lack of understanding of the design principles necessary \nfor effective human-machine interaction. Why this deficiency? Be-\ncause much of the design is done by engineers who are experts \nin technology but limited in their understanding of people. “We \nare people ourselves,” they think, “so we understand people.” But \nin fact, we humans are amazingly complex. Those who have not \nstudied human behavior often think it is pretty simple. Engineers, \nmoreover, make the mistake of thinking that logical explanation is \nsufficient: “If only people would read the instructions,” they say, \n“everything would be all right.”\nEngineers are trained to think logically. As a result, they come to \nbelieve that all people must think this way, and they design their \nmachines accordingly. When people have trouble, the engineers \nare upset, but often for the wrong reason. “What are these people \ndoing?” they will wonder. “Why are they doing that?” The prob-\nlem with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. \nWe have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we \nwould wish it to be.\n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n7\nI used to be an engineer, focused upon technical requirements, \nquite ignorant of people. Even after I switched into psychology \nand cognitive science, I still maintained my engineering emphasis \nupon logic and mechanism. It took a long time for me to realize \nthat my understanding of human behavior was relevant to my in-\nterest in the design of technology. As I watched people struggle \nwith technology, it became clear that the difficulties were caused \nby the technology, not the people.\nI was called upon to help analyze the American nuclear power \nplant accident at Three Mile Island (the island name comes from \nthe fact that it is located on a river, three miles south of Middle-\ntown in the state of Pennsylvania). In this incident, a rather simple \nmechanical failure was misdiagnosed. This led to several days of \ndifficulties and confusion, total destruction of the reactor, and a \nvery close call to a severe radiation release, all of which brought \nthe American nuclear power industry to a complete halt. The op-\nerators were blamed for these failures: “human error” was the im-\nmediate analysis. But the committee I was on discovered that the \nplant’s control rooms were so poorly designed that error was inevi-\ntable: design was at fault, not the operators. The moral was simple: \nwe were designing things for people, so we needed to understand \nboth technology and people. But that’s a difficult step for many \nengineers: machines are so logical, so orderly. If we didn’t have \npeople, everything would work so much better. Yup, that’s how I \nused to think.\nMy work with that committee changed my view of design. To-\nday, I realize that design presents a fascinating interplay of tech-\nnology and psychology, that the designers must understand both. \nEngineers still tend to believe in logic. They often explain to me \nin great, logical detail, why their designs are good, powerful, and \nwonderful. “Why are people having problems?” they wonder. \n“You are being too logical,” I say. “You are designing for people the \nway you would like them to be, not for the way they really are.”\nWhen the engineers object, I ask whether they have ever made \nan error, perhaps turning on or off the wrong light, or the wrong \n\n\n8 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nstove burner. “Oh yes,” they say, “but those were errors.” That’s \nthe point: even experts make errors. So we must design our ma-\nchines on the assumption that people will make errors. (Chapter 5 \nprovides a detailed analysis of human error.)\nHuman-Centered Design\nPeople are frustrated with everyday things. From the ever-increasing \ncomplexity of the automobile dashboard, to the increasing auto-\nmation in the home with its internal networks, complex music, \nvideo, and game systems for entertainment and communication, \nand the increasing automation in the kitchen, everyday life some-\ntimes seems like a never-ending fight against confusion, continued \nerrors, frustration, and a continual cycle of updating and maintain-\ning our belongings.\nIn the multiple decades that have elapsed since the first edition \nof this book was published, design has gotten better. There are now \nmany books and courses on the topic. But even though much has \nimproved, the rapid rate of technology change outpaces the ad-\nvances in design. New technologies, new applications, and new \nmethods of interaction are continually arising and evolving. New \nindustries spring up. Each new development seems to repeat the \nmistakes of the earlier ones; each new field requires time before \nit, too, adopts the principles of good design. And each new inven-\ntion of technology or interaction technique requires experimenta-\ntion and study before the principles of good design can be fully \nintegrated into practice. So, yes, things are getting better, but as a \nresult, the challenges are ever present.\nThe solution is human-centered design (HCD), an approach \nthat puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then de-\nsigns to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of be-\nhaving. Good design starts with an understanding of psychology \nand technology. Good design requires good communication, espe-\ncially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible, \nwhat is happening, and what is about to happen. Communica-\ntion is especially important when things go wrong. It is relatively \neasy to design things that work smoothly and harmoniously as \n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n9\nlong as things go right. But as soon as there is a problem or a mis-\nunderstanding, the problems arise. This is where good design \nis essential. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases \nwhere things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned. \nActually, this is where the most satisfaction can arise: when some-\nthing goes wrong but the machine highlights the problems, then \nthe person understands the issue, takes the proper actions, and the \nproblem is solved. When this happens smoothly, the collaboration \nof person and device feels wonderful.\nHuman-centered design is a design philosophy. It means start-\ning with a good understanding of people and the needs that the \ndesign is intended to meet. This understanding comes about pri-\nmarily through observation, for people themselves are often un-\naware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are \nencountering. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined \nis one of the most difficult parts of the design, so much so that the \nHCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as pos-\nsible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations. This is \ndone through rapid tests of ideas, and after each test modifying the \napproach and the problem definition. The results can be products \nthat truly meet the needs of people. Doing HCD within the rigid \ntime, budget, and other constraints of industry can be a challenge: \nChapter 6 examines these issues.\nWhere does HCD fit into the earlier discussion of the several dif-\nferent forms of design, especially the areas called industrial, inter-\naction, and experience design? These are all compatible. HCD is a \nphilosophy and a set of procedures, whereas the others are areas of \nfocus (see Table 1.1). The philosophy and procedures of HCD add \nExperience design\nIndustrial design \nThese are areas of focus\nInteraction design\nHuman-centered design \n The process that ensures that the \ndesigns match the needs and capa-\nbilities of the people for whom they \nare intended\nTABLE 1.1.

Experience: note \nthe word. Engineers tend not to like it; it is too subjective. But when \nI ask them about their favorite automobile or test equipment, they \nwill smile delightedly as they discuss the fit and finish, the sensa-\ntion of power during acceleration, their ease of control while shift-\ning or steering, or the wonderful feel of the knobs and switches on \nthe instrument. Those are experiences.\nExperience is critical, for it determines how fondly people re-\nmember their interactions. Was the overall experience positive, or \nwas it frustrating and confusing? When our home technology be-\nhaves in an uninterpretable fashion we can become confused, frus-\ntrated, and even angry—all strong negative emotions. When there \nis understanding it can lead to a feeling of control, of mastery, and \nof satisfaction or even pride—all strong positive emotions. Cog-\nnition and emotion are tightly intertwined, which means that the \ndesigners must design with both in mind.\nWhen we interact with a product, we need to figure out how to \nwork it. This means discovering what it does, how it works, and \nwhat operations are possible: discoverability. Discoverability re-\nsults from appropriate application of five fundamental psycholog-\nical concepts covered in the next few chapters: affordances, signifiers, \nconstraints, mappings, and feedback. But there is a sixth principle, \nperhaps most important of all: the conceptual model of the system. \nIt is the conceptual model that provides true understanding. So \nI now turn to these fundamental principles, starting with affor-\ndances, signifiers, mappings, and feedback, then moving to con-\nceptual models. Constraints are covered in Chapters 3 and 4.\nAFFORDANCES\nWe live in a world filled with objects, many natural, the rest artifi-\ncial. Every day we encounter thousands of objects, many of them \nnew to us. Many of the new objects are similar to ones we already \n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n11\nknow, but many are unique, yet we manage quite well. How do we \ndo this? Why is it that when we encounter many unusual natural \nobjects, we know how to interact with them? Why is this true with \nmany of the artificial, human-made objects we encounter? The an-\nswer lies with a few basic principles. Some of the most important \nof these principles come from a consideration of affordances.\nThe term affordance refers to the relationship between a physi-\ncal object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, \nwhether animal or human, or even machines and robots). An affor-\ndance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the \ncapabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could \npossibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore, \naffords sitting. Most chairs can also be carried by a single per-\nson (they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong \nperson or by a team of people. If young or relatively weak people \ncannot lift a chair, then for these people, the chair does not have \nthat affordance, it does not afford lifting.\nThe presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qual-\nities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting. \nThis relational definition of affordance gives considerable difficulty \nto many people. We are used to thinking that properties are asso-\nciated with objects. But affordance is not a property. An affordance \nis a relationship. Whether an affordance exists depends upon the \nproperties of both the object and the agent.\nGlass affords transparency. At the same time, its physical struc-\nture blocks the passage of most physical objects. As a result, glass \naffords seeing through and support, but not the passage of air or \nmost physical objects (atomic particles can pass through glass). \nThe blockage of passage can be considered an anti-affordance—the \nprevention of interaction. To be effective, affordances and anti-\naffordances have to be discoverable—perceivable. This poses a \ndifficulty with glass. The reason we like glass is its relative invis-\nibility, but this aspect, so useful in the normal window, also hides \nits anti-affordance property of blocking passage. As a result, birds \noften try to fly through windows. And every year, numerous peo-\nple injure themselves when they walk (or run) through closed glass \n\n\n12 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\ndoors or large picture windows. If an affordance or anti-affordance \ncannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is re-\nquired: I call this property a signifier (discussed in the next section).\nThe notion of affordance and the insights it provides originated \nwith J. J. Gibson, an eminent psychologist who provided many \nadvances to our understanding of human perception. I had in-\nteracted with him over many years, sometimes in formal confer-\nences and seminars, but most fruitfully over many bottles of beer, \nlate at night, just talking. We disagreed about almost everything. \nI was an engineer who became a cognitive psychologist, trying to \nunderstand how the mind works. He started off as a Gestalt psy-\nchologist, but then developed an approach that is today named \nafter him: Gibsonian psychology, an ecological approach to percep-\ntion. He argued that the world contained the clues and that people \nsimply picked them up through “direct perception.” I argued that \nnothing could be direct: the brain had to process the information \narriving at the sense organs to put together a coherent interpreta-\ntion. “Nonsense,” he loudly proclaimed; “it requires no interpreta-\ntion: it is directly perceived.” And then he would put his hand to \nhis ears, and with a triumphant flourish, turn off his hearing aids: \nmy counterarguments would fall upon deaf ears—literally.\nWhen I pondered my question—how do people know how to act \nwhen confronted with a novel situation—I realized that a large \npart of the answer lay in Gibson’s work. He pointed out that all the \nsenses work together, that we pick up information about the world \nby the combined result of all of them. “Information pickup” was one \nof his favorite phrases, and Gibson believed that the combined in-\nformation picked up by all of our sensory apparatus—sight, sound, \nsmell, touch, balance, kinesthetic, acceleration, body position—\ndetermines our perceptions without the need for internal pro-\ncessing or cognition. Although he and I disagreed about the role \nplayed by the brain’s internal processing, his brilliance was in fo-\ncusing attention on the rich amount of information present in the \nworld. Moreover, the physical objects conveyed important infor-\nmation about how people could interact with them, a property he \nnamed “affordance.”\n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n13\nAffordances exist even if they are not visible. For designers, their \nvisibility is critical: visible affordances provide strong clues to the \noperations of things. A flat plate mounted on a door affords push-\ning. Knobs afford turning, pushing, and pulling. Slots are for in-\nserting things into. Balls are for throwing or bouncing. Perceived \naffordances help people figure out what actions are possible with-\nout the need for labels or instructions. I call the signaling compo-\nnent of affordances signifiers.\nSIGNIFIERS\nAre affordances important to designers? The first edition of this \nbook introduced the term affordances to the world of design. The \ndesign community loved the concept and affordances soon prop-\nagated into the instruction and writing about design. I soon found \nmention of the term everywhere. Alas, the term became used in \nways that had nothing to do with the original.\nMany people find affordances difficult to understand because \nthey are relationships, not properties. Designers deal with fixed \nproperties, so there is a temptation to say that the property is an \naffordance. But that is not the only problem with the concept of \naffordances.\nDesigners have practical problems. They need to know how to \ndesign things to make them understandable. They soon discov-\nered that when working with the graphical designs for electronic \ndisplays, they needed a way to designate which parts could be \ntouched, slid upward, downward, or sideways, or tapped upon. \nThe actions could be done with a mouse, stylus, or fingers. Some \nsystems responded to body motions, gestures, and spoken words, \nwith no touching of any physical device. How could designers de-\nscribe what they were doing? There was no word that fit, so they \ntook the closest existing word—affordance. Soon designers were \nsaying such things as, “I put an affordance there,” to describe why \nthey displayed a circle on a screen to indicate where the person \nshould touch, whether by mouse or by finger. “No,” I said, “that is not \nan affordance. That is a way of communicating where the touch \nshould be. You are communicating where to do the touching: the \n\n\n14 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\naffordance of touching exists on the entire screen: you are trying to \nsignify where the touch should take place. That’s not the same thing \nas saying what action is possible.”\nNot only did my explanation fail to satisfy the design commu-\nnity, but I myself was unhappy. Eventually I gave up: designers \nneeded a word to describe what they were doing, so they chose \naffordance. What alternative did they have? I decided to provide a \nbetter answer: signifiers. Affordances determine what actions are \npossible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. \nWe need both.\nPeople need some way of understanding the product or service \nthey wish to use, some sign of what it is for, what is happening, \nand what the alternative actions are. People search for clues, for \nany sign that might help them cope and understand. It is the sign \nthat is important, anything that might signify meaningful informa-\ntion. Designers need to provide these clues. What people need, and \nwhat designers must provide, are signifiers. Good design requires, \namong other things, good communication of the purpose, struc-\nture, and operation of the device to the people who use it. That is \nthe role of the signifier.\nThe term signifier has had a long and illustrious career in the ex-\notic field of semiotics, the study of signs and symbols. But just as \nI appropriated affordance to use in design in a manner somewhat \ndifferent than its inventor had intended, I use signifier in a some-\nwhat different way than it is used in semiotics. For me, the term \nsignifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that \ncommunicates appropriate behavior to a person.\nSignifiers can be deliberate and intentional, such as the sign \npush on a door, but they may also be accidental and unintentional, \nsuch as our use of the visible trail made by previous people walk-\ning through a field or over a snow-covered terrain to determine \nthe best path. Or how we might use the presence or absence of \npeople waiting at a train station to determine whether we have \nmissed the train. (I explain these ideas in more detail in my book \nLiving with Complexity.)\n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n15\nFIGURE 1.2. Problem Doors: Signifiers Are Needed. Door hardware \ncan signal whether to push or pull without signs, but the hardware of the \ntwo doors in the upper photo, A, are identical even though one should be \npushed, the other pulled. The flat, ribbed horizontal bar has the obvious \nperceived affordance of pushing, but as the signs indicate, the door on the \nleft is to be pulled, the one on the right is to be pushed. In the bottom pair of \nphotos, B and C, there are no visible signifiers or affordances. How does one \nknow which side to push? Trial and error. When external signifiers—signs—\nhave to be added to something as simple as a door, it indicates bad design. \n(Photographs by the author.)\nThe signifier is an important communication device to the recipi-\nent, whether or not communication was intended. It doesn’t matter \nwhether the useful signal was deliberately placed or whether it is \nincidental: there is no necessary distinction. Why should it matter \nwhether a flag was placed as a deliberate clue to wind direction (as \nis done at airports or on the masts of sailboats) or was there as an \nA.\nB.\nC.\n\n\n16 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nadvertisement or symbol of pride in one’s country (as is done on \npublic buildings). Once I interpret a flag’s motion to indicate wind \ndirection, it does not matter why it was placed there.\nConsider a bookmark, a deliberately placed signifier of one’s place \nin reading a book. But the physical nature of books also makes a \nbookmark an accidental signifier, for its placement also indicates \nhow much of the book remains. Most readers have learned to use \nthis accidental signifier to aid in their enjoyment of the reading. \nWith few pages left, we know the end is near. And if the reading is \ntorturous, as in a school assignment, one can always console one-\nself by knowing there are “only a few more pages to get through.” \nElectronic book readers do not have the physical structure of paper \nbooks, so unless the software designer deliberately provides a clue, \nthey do not convey any signal about the amount of text remaining.\nFIGURE 1.3. Sliding Doors: Seldom Done Well. Sliding doors are seldom signified \nproperly. The top two photographs show the sliding door to the toilet on an Amtrak \ntrain in the United States. The handle clearly signifies “pull,” but in fact, it needs to be \nrotated and the door slid to the right. The owner of the store in Shanghai, China, Photo \nC, solved the problem with a sign. “don’t push!” it says, in both English and Chinese. \nAmtrak’s toilet door could have used a similar kind of sign. (Photographs by the author.) \nA.\nB.\nC.\n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n17\nWhatever their nature, planned or accidental, signifiers provide \nvaluable clues as to the nature of the world and of social activities. \nFor us to function in this social, technological world, we need to \ndevelop internal models of what things mean, of how they operate. \nWe seek all the clues we can find to help in this enterprise, and \nin this way, we are detectives, searching for whatever guidance \nwe might find. If we are fortunate, thoughtful designers provide \nthe clues for us. Otherwise, we must use our own creativity and \nimagination.\nFIGURE 1.4. The Sink That Would Not Drain: Where Signifiers Fail. I washed my \nhands in my hotel sink in London, but then, as shown in Photo A, was left with the \nquestion of how to empty the sink of the dirty water. I searched all over for a control: \nnone. I tried prying open the sink stopper with a spoon (Photo B): failure. I finally left \nmy hotel room and went to the front desk to ask for instructions. (Yes, I actually did.) \n“Push down on the stopper,” I was told. Yes, it worked (Photos C and D). But how was \nanyone to ever discover this? And why should I have to put my clean hands back into \nthe dirty water to empty the sink? The problem here is not just the lack of signifier, it is \nthe faulty decision to produce a stopper that requires people to dirty their clean hands \nto use it. (Photographs by the author.)\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\n\n\n18 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nAffordances, perceived affordances, and signifiers have much in \ncommon, so let me pause to ensure that the distinctions are clear.\nAffordances represent the possibilities in the world for how an \nagent (a person, animal, or machine) can interact with something. \nSome affordances are perceivable, others are invisible. Signifiers \nare signals. Some signifiers are signs, labels, and drawings placed \nin the world, such as the signs labeled “push,” “pull,” or “exit” \non doors, or arrows and diagrams indicating what is to be acted \nupon or in which direction to gesture, or other instructions. Some \nsignifiers are simply the perceived affordances, such as the han-\ndle of a door or the physical structure of a switch. Note that some \nperceived affordances may not be real: they may look like doors \nor places to push, or an impediment to entry, when in fact they \nare not. These are misleading signifiers, oftentimes accidental but \nsometimes purposeful, as when trying to keep people from doing \nactions for which they are not qualified, or in games, where one of \nthe challenges is to figure out what is real and what is not.\nFIGURE 1.5. Accidental Affordances \nCan Become Strong Signifiers. This \nwall, at the Industrial Design department \nof KAIST, in Korea, provides an anti-\naffordance, preventing people from falling \ndown the stair shaft. Its top is flat, an ac-\ncidental by-product of the design. But flat \nsurfaces afford support, and as soon as one \nperson discovers it can be used to dispose \nof empty drink containers, the discarded \ncontainer becomes a signifier, telling others \nthat it is permissible to discard their items \nthere.

But to my great \nsurprise, I saw a park vehicle simply go through the pipes. Huh? I \nwalked over and examined them: the pipes were made of rubber, \nso vehicles could simply drive right over them. A very clever sig-\nnifier, signaling a blocked road (via an apparent anti-affordance) \nto the average person, but permitting passage for those who knew.\nTo summarize:\n• Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the en-\nvironment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.\n• Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.\n• Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and \nhow they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they \nfail to function.\nIn design, signifiers are more important than affordances, for \nthey communicate how to use the design. A signifier can be words, \na graphical illustration, or just a device whose perceived affor-\ndances are unambiguous. Creative designers incorporate the sig-\nnifying part of the design into a cohesive experience. For the most \npart, designers can focus upon signifiers.\nBecause affordances and signifiers are fundamentally important \nprinciples of good design, they show up frequently in the pages of \nthis book. Whenever you see hand-lettered signs pasted on doors, \nswitches, or products, trying to explain how to work them, what to \ndo and what not to do, you are also looking at poor design.\nA F FORDA NC ES A ND SIGNIF IERS: A CON V ERSAT ION\nA designer approaches his mentor. He is working on a system that \nrecommends restaurants to people, based upon their preferences \nand those of their friends.

You added a signal of \nwhat to do.\nNot quite—you called them affor-\ndances even though they afford \nnothing new: they signify what to do \nand where to do it. So call them by \ntheir right name: “signifiers.”\nYou speak wisely. Communication is \na key to good design. And a key to \ncommunication is the signifier.\nProfound ideas are always obvious \nonce they are understood.\nMAPPING\nMapping is a technical term, borrowed from mathematics, mean-\ning the relationship between the elements of two sets of things. \nSuppose there are many lights in the ceiling of a classroom or au-\nditorium and a row of light switches on the wall at the front of the \n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n21\nroom. The mapping of switches to lights specifies which switch \ncontrols which light.\nMapping is an important concept in the design and layout of \ncontrols and displays. When the mapping uses spatial correspon-\ndence between the layout of the controls and the devices being \ncontrolled, it is easy to determine how to use them. In steering a \ncar, we rotate the steering wheel clockwise to cause the car to turn \nright: the top of the wheel moves in the same direction as the car. \nNote that other choices could have been made. In early cars, steer-\ning was controlled by a variety of devices, including tillers, han-\ndlebars, and reins. Today, some vehicles use joysticks, much as in a \ncomputer game. In cars that used tillers, steering was done much \nas one steers a boat: move the tiller to the left to turn to the right. \nTractors, construction equipment such as bulldozers and cranes, \nand military tanks that have tracks instead of wheels use separate \ncontrols for the speed and direction of each track: to turn right, the \nleft track is increased in speed, while the right track is slowed or \neven reversed. This is also how a wheelchair is steered.\nAll of these mappings for the control of vehicles work because \neach has a compelling conceptual model of how the operation of \nthe control affects the vehicle. Thus, if we speed up the left wheel \nof a wheelchair while stopping the right wheel, it is easy to imag-\nine the chair’s pivoting on the right wheel, circling to the right. In \nFIGURE 1.6. Signifiers on a Touch Screen. \nThe arrows and icons are signifiers: they pro-\nvide signals about the permissible operations \nfor this restaurant guide. Swiping left or right \nbrings up new restaurant recommendations. \nSwiping up reveals the menu for the restau-\nrant being displayed; swiping down, friends \nwho recommend the restaurant.\n\n\n22 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\na small boat, we can understand the tiller by realizing that pushing \nthe tiller to the left causes the ship’s rudder to move to the right \nand the resulting force of the water on the rudder slows down the \nright side of the boat, so that the boat rotates to the right. It doesn’t \nmatter whether these conceptual models are accurate: what mat-\nters is that they provide a clear way of remembering and under-\nstanding the mappings. The relationship between a control and \nits results is easiest to learn wherever there is an understandable \nmapping between the controls, the actions, and the intended result.\nNatural mapping, by which I mean taking advantage of spatial \nanalogies, leads to immediate understanding. For example, to move \nan object up, move the control up. To make it easy to determine \nwhich control works which light in a large room or auditorium, \narrange the controls in the same pattern as the lights. Some natural \nmappings are cultural or biological, as in the universal standard \nthat moving the hand up signifies more, moving it down signifies \nless, which is why it is appropriate to use vertical position to rep-\nresent intensity or amount. Other natural mappings follow from \nthe principles of perception and allow for the natural grouping or \npatterning of controls and feedback. Groupings and proximity \nare important principles from Gestalt psychology that can be used \nto map controls to function: related controls should be grouped to-\ngether. Controls should be close to the item being controlled.\nNote that there are many mappings that feel “natural” but in fact \nare specific to a particular culture: what is natural for one culture \nis not necessarily natural for another. In Chapter 3, I discuss how \nFIGURE 1.7. Good Mapping: Automobile Seat \nAdjustment Control. This is an excellent example of \nnatural mapping. The control is in the shape of the \nseat itself: the mapping is straightforward. To move \nthe front edge of the seat higher, lift up on the front \npart of the button. To make the seat back recline, \nmove the button back. The same principle could be \napplied to much more common objects. This partic-\nular control is from Mercedes-Benz, but this form of \nmapping is now used by many automobile compa-\nnies. (Photograph by the author.)\n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n23\ndifferent cultures view time, which has important implications for \nsome kinds of mappings.\nA device is easy to use when the set of possible actions is visi-\nble, when the controls and displays exploit natural mappings. The \nprinciples are simple but rarely incorporated into design. Good de-\nsign takes care, planning, thought, and an understanding of how \npeople behave.\nFEEDBACK\nEver watch people at an elevator repeatedly push the Up button, \nor repeatedly push the pedestrian button at a street crossing? Ever \ndrive to a traffic intersection and wait an inordinate amount of \ntime for the signals to change, wondering all the time whether the \ndetection circuits noticed your vehicle (a common problem with \nbicycles)? What is missing in all these cases is feedback: some way \nof letting you know that the system is working on your request.\nFeedback—communicating the results of an action—is a well-\nknown concept from the science of control and information theory. \nImagine trying to hit a target with a ball when you cannot see the \ntarget. Even as simple a task as picking up a glass with the hand re-\nquires feedback to aim the hand properly, to grasp the glass, and to  \nlift it. A misplaced hand will spill the contents, too hard a grip will \nbreak the glass, and too weak a grip will allow it to fall. The human \nnervous system is equipped with numerous feedback mechanisms, \nincluding visual, auditory, and touch sensors, as well as vestibular \nand proprioceptive systems that monitor body position and mus-\ncle and limb movements. Given the importance of feedback, it is \namazing how many products ignore it.\nFeedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second \ncan be disconcerting. If the delay is too long, people often give up, \ngoing off to do other activities. This is annoying to the people, but \nit can also be wasteful of resources when the system spends con-\nsiderable time and effort to satisfy the request, only to find that the \nintended recipient is no longer there. Feedback must also be infor-\nmative. Many companies try to save money by using inexpensive \nlights or sound generators for feedback. These simple light flashes \n\n\n24 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nor beeps are usually more annoying than useful. They tell us that \nsomething has happened, but convey very little information about \nwhat has happened, and then nothing about what we should do \nabout it. When the signal is auditory, in many cases we cannot \neven be certain which device has created the sound. If the signal \nis a light, we may miss it unless our eyes are on the correct spot \nat the correct time. Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback \nat all, because it is distracting, uninformative, and in many cases \nirritating and anxiety-provoking.\nToo much feedback can be even more annoying than too little. \nMy dishwasher likes to beep at three a.m. to tell me that the wash \nis done, defeating my goal of having it work in the middle of the \nnight so as not to disturb anyone (and to use less expensive elec-\ntricity). But worst of all is inappropriate, uninterpretable feedback. \nThe irritation caused by a “backseat driver” is well enough known \nthat it is the staple of numerous jokes. Backseat drivers are often \ncorrect, but their remarks and comments can be so numerous and \ncontinuous that instead of helping, they become an irritating dis-\ntraction. Machines that give too much feedback are like backseat \ndrivers. Not only is it distracting to be subjected to continual flash-\ning lights, text announcements, spoken voices, or beeps and boops, \nbut it can be dangerous. Too many announcements cause people to \nignore all of them, or wherever possible, disable all of them, which \nmeans that critical and important ones are apt to be missed. Feed-\nback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things, \nincluding a calm and relaxing environment.\nPoor design of feedback can be the result of decisions aimed at \nreducing costs, even if they make life more difficult for people. \nRather than use multiple signal lights, informative displays, or \nrich, musical sounds with varying patterns, the focus upon cost \nreduction forces the design to use a single light or sound to convey \nmultiple types of information. If the choice is to use a light, then \none flash might mean one thing; two rapid flashes, something else. \nA long flash might signal yet another state; and a long flash fol-\nlowed by a brief one, yet another. If the choice is to use a sound, \nquite often the least expensive sound device is selected, one that \n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n25\ncan only produce a high-frequency beep. Just as with the lights, \nthe only way to signal different states of the machine is by beeping \ndifferent patterns. What do all these different patterns mean? How \ncan we possibly learn and remember them? It doesn’t help that \nevery different machine uses a different pattern of lights or beeps, \nsometimes with the same patterns meaning contradictory things \nfor different machines. All the beeps sound alike, so it often isn’t \neven possible to know which machine is talking to us.\nFeedback has to be planned. All actions need to be confirmed, \nbut in a manner that is unobtrusive. Feedback must also be prior-\nitized, so that unimportant information is presented in an unob-\ntrusive fashion, but important signals are presented in a way that \ndoes capture attention. When there are major emergencies, then \neven important signals have to be prioritized. When every device \nis signaling a major emergency, nothing is gained by the result-\ning cacophony. The continual beeps and alarms of equipment can \nbe dangerous. In many emergencies, workers have to spend valu-\nable time turning off all the alarms because the sounds interfere \nwith the concentration required to solve the problem. Hospital op-\nerating rooms, emergency wards. Nuclear power control plants. \nAirplane cockpits. All can become confusing, irritating, and life-\nendangering places because of excessive feedback, excessive alarms, \nand incompatible message coding. Feedback is essential, but it has \nto be done correctly. Appropriately.\nCONCEPTUAL MODELS\nA conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, \nof how something works. It doesn’t have to be complete or even \naccurate as long as it is useful. The files, folders, and icons you see \ndisplayed on a computer screen help people create the conceptual \nmodel of documents and folders inside the computer, or of apps \nor applications residing on the screen, waiting to be summoned. In \nfact, there are no folders inside the computer—those are effective \nconceptualizations designed to make them easier to use. Some-\ntimes these depictions can add to the confusion, however. When \nreading e-mail or visiting a website, the material appears to be on \n\n\n26 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nthe device, for that is where it is displayed and manipulated. But \nin fact, in many cases the actual material is “in the cloud,” located \non some distant machine. The conceptual model is of one, coherent \nimage, whereas it may actually consist of parts, each located on \ndifferent machines that could be almost anywhere in the world. \nThis simplified model is helpful for normal usage, but if the net-\nwork connection to the cloud services is interrupted, the result can \nbe confusing. Information is still on their screen, but users can no \nlonger save it or retrieve new things: their conceptual model offers \nno explanation. Simplified models are valuable only as long as the \nassumptions that support them hold true.\nThere are often multiple conceptual models of a product or de-\nvice. People’s conceptual models for the way that regenerative \nbraking in a hybrid or electrically powered automobile works are \nquite different for average drivers than for technically sophisti-\ncated drivers, different again for whoever must service the system, \nand yet different again for those who designed the system.\nConceptual models found in technical manuals and books for \ntechnical use can be detailed and complex. The ones we are con-\ncerned with here are simpler: they reside in the minds of the peo-\nple who are using the product, so they are also “mental models.” \nMental models, as the name implies, are the conceptual models in \npeople’s minds that represent their understanding of how things \nwork. Different people may hold different mental models of the \nsame item. Indeed, a single person might have multiple models of \nthe same item, each dealing with a different aspect of its opera-\ntion: the models can even be in conflict.\nConceptual models are often inferred from the device itself. Some \nmodels are passed on from person to person. Some come from \nmanuals. Usually the device itself offers very little assistance, so \nthe model is constructed by experience. Quite often these models \nare erroneous, and therefore lead to difficulties in using the device.\nThe major clues to how things work come from their perceived \nstructure—in particular from signifiers, affordances, constraints, \nand mappings.

The holes are clearly there to put something \ninto, and the only logical things that will fit are fingers. The holes \nare both affordances—they allow the fingers to be inserted—and \nsignifiers—they indicate where the fingers are to go. The sizes of \nthe holes provide constraints to limit the possible fingers: a big \nhole suggests several fingers; a small hole, only one. The mapping \nbetween holes and fingers—the set of possible operations—is sig-\nnified and constrained by the holes. Moreover, the operation is not \nsensitive to finger placement: if you use the wrong fingers (or the \nwrong hand), the scissors still work, although not as comfortably. \nYou can figure out the scissors because their operating parts are \nvisible and the implications clear. The conceptual model is obvious, \nand there is effective use of signifiers, affordances, and constraints.\nWhat happens when the device does not suggest a good concep-\ntual model? Consider my digital watch with five buttons: two along \nthe top, two along the bottom, and one on the left side (Figure 1.8). \nWhat is each button for? How would you set the time? There is no \nway to tell—no evident relationship between the operating controls \nand the functions, no constraints, no apparent mappings. Moreover, \nthe buttons have multiple ways of being used. Two of the buttons \ndo different things when pushed quickly or when kept depressed \nfor several seconds. Some operations require simultaneous depres-\nsion of several of the buttons. The only way to tell how to work the \nwatch is to read the manual, over and over again. With the scissors, \nmoving the handle makes the blades move. The watch provides no \nFIGURE 1.8. Junghans Mega 1000 Digital Radio \nControlled Watch. There is no good conceptual model \nfor understanding the operation of my watch. It has five \nbuttons with no hints as to what each one does. And yes, \nthe buttons do different things in their different modes. \nBut it is a very nice-looking watch, and always has the \nexact time because it checks official radio time stations. \n(The top row of the display is the date: Wednesday, Feb-\nruary 20, the eighth week of the year.)

A good conceptual model allows \nus to predict the effects of our actions. Without a good model, we op-\nerate by rote, blindly; we do operations as we were told to do them; \nwe can’t fully appreciate why, what effects to expect, or what to do \nif things go wrong. As long as things work properly, we can manage. \nWhen things go wrong, however, or when we come upon a novel \nsituation, then we need a deeper understanding, a good model.\nFor everyday things, conceptual models need not be very com-\nplex. After all, scissors, pens, and light switches are pretty simple \ndevices. There is no need to understand the underlying physics or \nchemistry of each device we own, just the relationship between \nthe controls and the outcomes. When the model presented to us is \ninadequate or wrong (or, worse, nonexistent), we can have difficul-\nties. Let me tell you about my refrigerator.\nI used to own an ordinary, two-compartment refrigerator—nothing \nvery fancy about it. The problem was that I couldn’t set the tem-\nperature properly. There were only two things to do: adjust the \ntemperature of the freezer compartment and adjust the tempera-\nFIGURE 1.9. Refrigerator Controls. Two compartments—\nfresh food and freezer—and two controls (in the fresh food \nunit). Your task: Suppose the freezer is too cold, the fresh food \nsection just right. How would you adjust the controls so as to \nmake the freezer warmer and keep the fresh food the same? \n(Photograph by the author.)\n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n29\nture of the fresh food compartment. And there were two controls, \none labeled “freezer,” the other “refrigerator.” What’s the problem?\nOh, perhaps I’d better warn you. The two controls are not inde-\npendent. The freezer control also affects the fresh food tempera-\nture, and the fresh food control also affects the freezer. Moreover, \nthe manual warns that one should “always allow twenty-four (24) \nhours for the temperature to stabilize whether setting the controls \nfor the first time or making an adjustment.”\nIt was extremely difficult to regulate the temperature of my old \nrefrigerator. Why? Because the controls suggest a false conceptual \nmodel. Two compartments, two controls, which implies that each \ncontrol is responsible for the temperature of the compartment that \ncarries its name: this conceptual model is shown in Figure 1.10A. It \nis wrong. In fact, there is only one thermostat and only one cooling \nmechanism. One control adjusts the thermostat setting, the other \nthe relative proportion of cold air sent to each of the two compart-\nments of the refrigerator. This is why the two controls interact: this \nconceptual model is shown in Figure 1.10B. In addition, there must \nbe a temperature sensor, but there is no way of knowing where it \nis located. With the conceptual model suggested by the controls, \nFIGURE 1.10. Two Conceptual Models for a Refrigerator. The conceptual model \nA is provided by the system image of the refrigerator as gleaned from the controls. \nEach control determines the temperature of the named part of the refrigerator. This \nmeans that each compartment has its own temperature sensor and cooling unit. This is \nwrong. The correct conceptual model is shown in B. There is no way of knowing where \nthe temperature sensor is located so it is shown outside the refrigerator. The freezer \ncontrol determines the freezer temperature (so is this where the sensor is located?). \nThe refrigerator control determines how much of the cold air goes to the freezer and \nhow much to the refrigerator.\nA.\nB.\n\n\n30 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nadjusting the temperatures is almost impossible and always frus-\ntrating. Given the correct model, life would be much easier.\nWhy did the manufacturer suggest the wrong conceptual model? \nWe will never know. In the twenty-five years since the publication \nof the first edition of this book, I have had many letters from people \nthanking me for explaining their confusing refrigerator, but never \nany communication from the manufacturer (General Electric). Per-\nhaps the designers thought the correct model was too complex, \nthat the model they were giving was easier to understand. But with \nthe wrong conceptual model, it was impossible to set the controls. \nAnd even though I am convinced I knew the correct model, I still \ncouldn’t accurately adjust the temperatures because the refrigera-\ntor design made it impossible to discover which control was for the \ntemperature sensor, which for the relative proportion of cold air, \nand in which compartment the sensor was located. The lack of im-\nmediate feedback for the actions did not help: it took twenty-four \nhours to see whether the new setting was appropriate. I shouldn’t \nhave to keep a laboratory notebook and do controlled experiments \njust to set the temperature of my refrigerator.\nI am happy to say that I no longer own that refrigerator. In-\nstead I have one that has two separate controls, one in the fresh \nfood compartment, one in the freezer compartment. Each control \nis nicely calibrated in degrees and labeled with the name of the \ncompartment it controls. The two compartments are independent: \nsetting the temperature in one has no effect on the temperature in \nthe other. This solution, although ideal, does cost more. But far less \nexpensive solutions are possible. With today’s inexpensive sensors \nand motors, it should be possible to have a single cooling unit with \na motor-controlled valve controlling the relative proportion of cold \nair diverted to each compartment. A simple, inexpensive computer \nchip could regulate the cooling unit and valve position so that the \ntemperatures in the two compartments match their targets. A bit \nmore work for the engineering design team? Yes, but the results \nwould be worth it. Alas, General Electric is still selling refrigerators \nwith the very same controls and mechanisms that cause so much \n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n31\nconfusion. The photograph in Figure 1.9 is from a contemporary \nrefrigerator, photographed in a store while preparing this book.\nThe System Image\nPeople create mental models of themselves, others, the environ-\nment, and the things with which they interact. These are concep-\ntual models formed through experience, training, and instruction. \nThese models serve as guides to help achieve our goals and in un-\nderstanding the world.\nHow do we form an appropriate conceptual model for the de-\nvices we interact with? We cannot talk to the designer, so we rely \nupon whatever information is available to us: what the device \nlooks like, what we know from using similar things in the past, \nwhat was told to us in the sales literature, by salespeople and ad-\nvertisements, by articles we may have read, by the product website \nand instruction manuals. I call the combined information available \nto us the system image. When the system image is incoherent or in-\nappropriate, as in the case of the refrigerator, then the user cannot \neasily use the device. If it is incomplete or contradictory, there will \nbe trouble.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1.11, the designer of the product and the \nperson using the product form somewhat disconnected vertices of \na triangle. The designer’s conceptual model is the designer’s con-\nception of the product, occupying one vertex of the triangle. The \nproduct itself is no longer with the designer, so it is isolated as a \nsecond vertex, perhaps sitting on the user’s kitchen counter. The \nsystem image is what can be perceived from the physical struc-\nture that has been built (including documentation, instructions, \nsignifiers, and any information available from websites and help \nlines). The user’s conceptual model comes from the system image, \nthrough interaction with the product, reading, searching for online \ninformation, and from whatever manuals are provided. The de-\nsigner expects the user’s model to be identical to the design model, \nbut because designers cannot communicate directly with users, the \nentire burden of communication is on the system image.\n\n\n32 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nFigure 1.11 indicates why communication is such an important \naspect of good design. No matter how brilliant the product, if peo-\nple cannot use it, it will receive poor reviews. It is up to the de-\nsigner to provide the appropriate information to make the product \nunderstandable and usable. Most important is the provision of a \ngood conceptual model that guides the user when thing go wrong. \nWith a good conceptual model, people can figure out what has \nhappened and correct the things that went wrong. Without a good \nmodel, they struggle, often making matters worse.\nGood conceptual models are the key to understandable, enjoy-\nable products: good communication is the key to good conceptual \nmodels.\nThe Paradox of Technology\nTechnology offers the potential to make life easier and more en-\njoyable; each new technology provides increased benefits. At the \nsame time, added complexities increase our difficulty and frustra-\ntion with technology. The design problem posed by technological \nadvances is enormous. Consider the wristwatch. A few decades \nago, watches were simple. All you had to do was set the time and \nkeep the watch wound. The standard control was the stem: a knob \nat the side of the watch. Turning the knob would wind the spring \nthat provided power to the watch movement. Pulling out the knob \nand turning it rotated the hands. The operations were easy to learn \nand easy to do. There was a reasonable relationship between the \nFIGURE 1.11. The Designer’s Model, \nthe User’s Model, and the System Im-\nage. The designer’s conceptual model is \nthe designer’s conception of the look, feel, \nand operation of a product. The system \nimage is what can be derived from the \nphysical structure that has been built \n(including documentation). The user’s \nmental model is developed through in-\nteraction with the product and the system \nimage. Designers expect the user’s model \nto be identical to their own, but because \nthey cannot communicate directly with \nthe user, the burden of communication is \nwith the system image.\n\n\n \none: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things \n33\nturning of the knob and the resulting turning of the hands. The \ndesign even took into account human error. In its normal position, \nturning the stem wound the mainspring of the clock. The stem had \nto be pulled before it would engage the gears for setting the time. \nAccidental turns of the stem did no harm.\nWatches in olden times were expensive instruments, manu-\nfactured by hand. They were sold in jewelry stores. Over time, \nwith the introduction of digital technology, the cost of watches \ndecreased rapidly, while their accuracy and reliability increased. \nWatches became tools, available in a wide variety of styles and \nshapes and with an ever-increasing number of functions. Watches \nwere sold everywhere, from local shops to sporting goods stores \nto electronic stores. Moreover, accurate clocks were incorporated in \nmany appliances, from phones to musical keyboards: many people \nno longer felt the need to wear a watch. Watches became inexpen-\nsive enough that the average person could own multiple watches. \nThey became fashion accessories, where one changed the watch \nwith each change in activity and each change of clothes.\nIn the modern digital watch, instead of winding the spring, we \nchange the battery, or in the case of a solar-powered watch, ensure \nthat it gets its weekly dose of light. The technology has allowed \nmore functions: the watch can give the day of the week, the month, \nand the year; it can act as a stopwatch (which itself has several \nfunctions), a countdown timer, and an alarm clock (or two); it has \nthe ability to show the time for different time zones; it can act as \na counter and even as a calculator. My watch, shown in Figure \n1.8, has many functions. It even has a radio receiver to allow it to \nset its time with official time stations around the world. Even so, \nit is far less complex than many that are available. Some watches \nhave built-in compasses and barometers, accelerometers, and tem-\nperature gauges. Some have GPS and Internet receivers so they \ncan display the weather and news, e-mail messages, and the lat-\nest from social networks. Some have built-in cameras. Some work \nwith buttons, knobs, motion, or speech. Some detect gestures. The \nwatch is no longer just an instrument for telling time: it has become \na platform for enhancing multiple activities and lifestyles.\n\n\n34 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nThe added functions cause problems: How can all these func-\ntions fit into a small, wearable size? There are no easy answers. \nMany people have solved the problem by not using a watch. They \nuse their phone instead. A cell phone performs all the functions \nmuch better than the tiny watch, while also displaying the time.\nNow imagine a future where instead of the phone replacing \nthe watch, the two will merge, perhaps worn on the wrist, per-\nhaps on the head like glasses, complete with display screen. The \nphone, watch, and components of a computer will all form one \nunit. We will have flexible displays that show only a tiny amount \nof information in their normal state, but that can unroll to consid-\nerable size. Projectors will be so small and light that they can be \nbuilt into watches or phones (or perhaps rings and other jewelry), \nprojecting their images onto any convenient surface. Or perhaps \nour devices won’t have displays, but will quietly whisper the re-\nsults into our ears, or simply use whatever display happens to be \navailable: the display in the seatback of cars or airplanes, hotel \nroom televisions, whatever is nearby. The devices will be able to \ndo many useful things, but I fear they will also frustrate: so many \nthings to control, so little space for controls or signifiers. The ob-\nvious solution is to use exotic gestures or spoken commands, but \nhow will we learn, and then remember, them? As I discuss later, \nthe best solution is for there to be agreed upon standards, so we \nneed learn the controls only once. But as I also discuss, agreeing \nupon these is a complex process, with many competing forces hin-\ndering rapid resolution. We will see.\nThe same technology that simplifies life by providing more \nfunctions in each device also complicates life by making the device \nharder to learn, harder to use. This is the paradox of technology \nand the challenge for the designer.\nThe Design Challenge\nDesign requires the cooperative efforts of multiple disciplines. The \nnumber of different disciplines required to produce a successful \nproduct is staggering. Great design requires great designers, but \nthat isn’t enough: it also requires great management, because the \n",

Each \ndiscipline has a different perspective of the relative importance of \nthe many factors that make up a product. One discipline argues \nthat it must be usable and understandable, another that it must be \nattractive, yet another that it has to be affordable. Moreover, the de-\nvice has to be reliable, be able to be manufactured and serviced. It \nmust be distinguishable from competing products and superior in \ncritical dimensions such as price, reliability, appearance, and the \nfunctions it provides.

The view-\npoint of the business is also important, because it does not matter \nhow wonderful the product is if not enough people buy it. If a \nproduct does not sell, the company must often stop producing it, \neven if it is a great product. Few companies can sustain the huge \ncost of keeping an unprofitable product alive long enough for its \nsales to reach profitability—with new products, this period is usu-\nally measured in years, and sometimes, as with the adoption of \nhigh-definition television, decades.\nDesigning well is not easy. The manufacturer wants something \nthat can be produced economically. The store wants something \nthat will be attractive to its customers. The purchaser has several \n\n\n36 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\ndemands. In the store, the purchaser focuses on price and appear-\nance, and perhaps on prestige value. At home, the same person \nwill pay more attention to functionality and usability. The repair \nservice cares about maintainability: how easy is the device to take \napart, diagnose, and service? The needs of those concerned are \ndifferent and often conflict. Nonetheless, if the design team has \nrepresentatives from all the constituencies present at the same \ntime, it is often possible to reach satisfactory solutions for all \nthe needs. It is when the disciplines operate independently of one \nanother that major clashes and deficiencies occur. The challenge \nis to use the principles of human-centered design to produce pos-\nitive results, products that enhance lives and add to our pleasure \nand enjoyment. The goal is to produce a great product, one that is \nsuccessful, and that customers love. It can be done.\n\n\n \n \n37\nC H A P T E R  T W O\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY \nOF EVERYDAY \nACTIONS\nDuring my family’s stay in England, we rented a furnished house while \nthe owners were away. One day, our landlady returned to the house \nto get some personal papers. She walked over to the old, metal filing \ncabinet and attempted to open the top drawer. It wouldn’t open. She \npushed it forward and backward, right and left, up and down, without \nsuccess. I offered to help. I wiggled the drawer. Then I twisted the front \npanel, pushed down hard, and banged the front with the palm of one \nhand. The cabinet drawer slid open. “Oh,” she said, “I’m sorry. I am so \nbad at mechanical things.” No, she had it backward. It is the mechanical \nthing that should be apologizing, perhaps saying, “I’m sorry. I am so \nbad with people.”\nMy landlady had two problems. First, although she had \na clear goal (retrieve some personal papers) and even \na plan for achieving that goal (open the top drawer of \nthe filing cabinet, where those papers are kept), once \nthat plan failed, she had no idea of what to do. But she also had a \nsecond problem: she thought the problem lay in her own lack of \nability: she blamed herself, falsely.\nHow was I able to help? First, I refused to accept the false accu-\nsation that it was the fault of the landlady: to me, it was clearly a \nfault in the mechanics of the old filing cabinet that prevented the \ndrawer from opening. Second, I had a conceptual model of how \nthe cabinet worked, with an internal mechanism that held the door \nshut in normal usage, and the belief that the drawer mechanism \nwas probably out of alignment. This conceptual model gave me \na plan: wiggle the drawer. That failed. That caused me  to modify \n\n\n38 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nmy plan: wiggling may have been appropriate but not forceful \nenough, so I resorted to brute force to try to twist the cabinet back \ninto its proper alignment. This felt good to me—the cabinet drawer \nmoved slightly—but it still didn’t open. So I resorted to the most \npowerful tool employed by experts the world around—I banged \non the cabinet. And yes, it opened. In my mind, I decided (without \nany evidence) that my hit had jarred the mechanism sufficiently to \nallow the drawer to open.\nThis example highlights the themes of this chapter. First, how do \npeople do things? It is easy to learn a few basic steps to perform \noperations with our technologies (and yes, even filing cabinets are \ntechnology). But what happens when things go wrong? How do \nwe detect that they aren’t working, and then how do we know \nwhat to do? To help understand this, I first delve into human psy-\nchology and a simple conceptual model of how people select and \nthen evaluate their actions. This leads the discussion to the role of \nunderstanding (via a conceptual model) and of emotions: pleasure \nwhen things work smoothly and frustration when our plans are \nthwarted. Finally, I conclude with a summary of how the lessons \nof this chapter translate into principles of design.\nHow People Do Things: \nThe Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation\nWhen people use something, they face two gulfs: the Gulf of Exe-\ncution, where they try to figure out how it operates, and the Gulf \nof Evaluation, where they try to figure out what happened (Fig-\nure 2.1). The role of the designer is to help people bridge the \ntwo gulfs.\nIn the case of the filing cabinet, there were visible elements that \nhelped bridge the Gulf of Execution when everything was work-\ning perfectly. The drawer handle clearly signified that it should be \npulled and the slider on the handle indicated how to release the \ncatch that normally held the drawer in place. But when these oper-\nations failed, there then loomed a big gulf: what other operations \ncould be done to open the drawer?\n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n39\nThe Gulf of Evaluation \nwas easily bridged, at first. \nThat is, the catch was re-\nleased, the drawer handle \npulled, yet nothing hap-\npened. The lack of action \nsignified a failure to reach \nthe goal. But when other \noperations were tried, such \nas my twisting and pull-\ning, the filing cabinet pro-\nvided no more information \nabout whether I was get-\nting closer to the goal.\nThe Gulf of Evaluation \nreflects the amount of ef-\nfort that the person must \nmake to interpret the phys-\nical state of the device and to determine how well the expectations \nand intentions have been met. The gulf is small when the device \nprovides information about its state in a form that is easy to get, \nis easy to interpret, and matches the way the person thinks about \nthe system. What are the major design elements that help bridge the \nGulf of Evaluation? Feedback and a good conceptual model.\nThe gulfs are present for many devices. Interestingly, many peo-\nple do experience difficulties, but explain them away by blaming \nthemselves. In the case of things they believe they should be capa-\nble of using—water faucets, refrigerator temperature controls, stove \ntops—they simply think, “I’m being stupid.” Alternatively, for com-\nplicated-looking devices—sewing machines, washing machines, \ndigital watches, or almost any digital controls—they simply give up, \ndeciding that they are incapable of understanding them. Both expla-\nnations are wrong. These are the things of everyday household use. \nNone of them has a complex underlying structure. The difficulties \nreside in their design, not in the people attempting to use them.\nFIGURE 2.1. The Gulfs of Execution and Eval-\nuation. When people encounter a device, they \nface two gulfs: the Gulf of Execution, where they \ntry to figure out how to use it, and the Gulf of \nEvaluation, where they try to figure out what \nstate it is in and whether their actions got them \nto their goal.\n\n\n40 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nHow can the designer help bridge the two gulfs? To answer that \nquestion, we need to delve more deeply into the psychology of \nhuman action. But the basic tools have already been discussed: \nWe bridge the Gulf of Execution through the use of signifiers, con-\nstraints, mappings, and a conceptual model. We bridge the Gulf of \nEvaluation through the use of feedback and a conceptual model.\nThe Seven Stages of Action\nThere are two parts to an action: executing the action and then \nevaluating the results: doing and interpreting. Both execution and \nevaluation require understanding: how the item works and what \nresults it produces. Both execution and evaluation can affect our \nemotional state.\nSuppose I am sitting in my armchair, reading a book. It is dusk, \nand the light is getting dimmer and dimmer. My current activity \nis reading, but that goal is starting to fail because of the decreasing \nillumination. This realization triggers a new goal: get more light. \nHow do I do that? I have many choices. I could open the curtains, \nmove so that I sit where there is more light, or perhaps turn on a \nnearby light. This is the planning stage, determining which of the \nmany possible plans of action to follow. But even when I decide \nto turn on the nearby light, I still have to determine how to get it \ndone. I could ask someone to do it for me, I could use my left hand \nor my right. Even after I have decided upon a plan, I still have to \nspecify how I will do it. Finally, I must execute—do—the action. \nWhen I am doing a frequent act, one for which I am quite experi-\nenced and skilled, most of these stages are subconscious. When I \nam still learning how to do it, determining the plan, specifying the \nsequence, and interpreting the result are conscious.\nSuppose I am driving in my car and my action plan requires me \nto make a left turn at a street intersection. If I am a skilled driver, \nI don’t have to give much conscious attention to specify or per-\nform the action sequence. I think “left” and smoothly execute the \nrequired action sequence. But if I am just learning to drive, I have \nto think about each separate component of the action. I must ap-\nply the brakes and check for cars behind and around me, cars and \n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n41\npedestrians in front of me, \nand whether there are traf-\nfic signs or signals that I \nhave to obey. I must move \nmy feet back and forth be-\ntween pedals and my hands \nto the turn signals and back \nto the steering wheel (while \nI try to remember just how \nmy instructor told me I \nshould position my hands \nwhile making a turn), and \nmy visual attention is di-\nvided among all the activ-\nity around me, sometimes \nlooking directly, some-\ntimes rotating my head, \nand sometimes using the rear- and side-view mirrors. To the skilled \ndriver, it is all easy and straightforward. To the beginning driver, \nthe task seems impossible.\nThe specific actions bridge the gap between what we would \nlike to have done (our goals) and all possible physical actions to \nachieve those goals. After we specify what actions to make, we \nmust actually do them—the stages of execution. There are three \nstages of execution that follow from the goal: plan, specify, and \nperform (the left side of Figure 2.2). Evaluating what happened has \nthree stages: first, perceiving what happened in the world; second, \ntrying to make sense of it (interpreting it); and, finally, comparing \nwhat happened with what was wanted (the right side of Figure 2.2).\nThere we have it. Seven stages of action: one for goals, three for \nexecution, and three for evaluation (Figure 2.2).\n1. Goal (form the goal) \n5. Perceive (the state of the world)\n2. Plan (the action) \n6. Interpret (the perception)\n3. Specify (an action sequence) 7. Compare (the outcome with the goal)\n4. Perform (the action sequence)\nFIGURE 2.2. The Seven Stages of the Action \nCycle. Putting all the stages together yields the \nthree stages of execution (plan, specify, and per-\nform), three stages of evaluation (perceive, in-\nterpret, and compare), and, of course, the goal: \nseven stages in all.\n\n\n42 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nThe seven-stage action cycle is simplified, but it provides a use-\nful framework for understanding human action and for guiding \ndesign. It has proven to be helpful in designing interaction. Not all \nof the activity in the stages is conscious. Goals tend to be, but even \nthey may be subconscious. We can do many actions, repeatedly \ncycling through the stages while being blissfully unaware that we \nare doing so. It is only when we come across something new or \nreach some impasse, some problem that disrupts the normal flow \nof activity, that conscious attention is required.\nMost behavior does not require going through all stages in se-\nquence; however, most activities will not be satisfied by single ac-\ntions. There must be numerous sequences, and the whole activity \nmay last hours or even days. There are multiple feedback loops \nin which the results of one activity are used to direct further ones, in \nwhich goals lead to subgoals, and plans lead to subplans. There are \nactivities in which goals are forgotten, discarded, or reformulated.\nLet’s go back to my act of turning on the light. This is a case of \nevent-driven behavior: the sequence starts with the world, caus-\ning evaluation of the state and the formulation of a goal. The trig-\nger was an environmental event: the lack of light, which made \nreading difficult. This led to a violation of the goal of reading, so \nit led to a subgoal—get more light. But reading was not the high-\nlevel goal. For each goal, one has to ask, “Why is that the goal?” \nWhy was I reading? I was trying to prepare a meal using a new \nrecipe, so I needed to reread it before I started. Reading was thus \na subgoal. But cooking was itself a subgoal. I was cooking in or-\nder to eat, which had the goal of satisfying my hunger. So the \nhierarchy of goals is roughly: satisfy hunger; eat; cook; read cook-\nbook; get more light. This is called a root cause analysis: asking \n“Why?” until the ultimate, fundamental cause of the activity is \nreached.\nThe action cycle can start from the top, by establishing a new \ngoal, in which case we call it goal-driven behavior. In this situ-\nation, the cycle starts with the goal and then goes through the \nthree stages of execution. But the action cycle can also start from \nthe bottom, triggered by some event in the world, in which case we \n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n43\ncall it either data-driven or event-driven behavior. In this situation, \nthe cycle starts with the environment, the world, and then goes \nthrough the three stages of evaluation.\nFor many everyday tasks, goals and intentions are not well spec-\nified: they are opportunistic rather than planned. Opportunistic \nactions are those in which the behavior takes advantage of circum-\nstances. Rather than engage in extensive planning and analysis, we \ngo about the day’s activities and do things as opportunities arise. \nThus, we may not have planned to try a new café or to ask a question \nof a friend. Rather, we go through the day’s activities, and if we find \nourselves near the café or encountering the friend, then we allow the \nopportunity to trigger the appropriate activity. Otherwise, we might \nnever get to that café or ask our friend the question. For crucial \ntasks we make special efforts to ensure that they get done. Oppor-\ntunistic actions are less precise and certain than specified goals and \nintentions, but they result in less mental effort, less inconvenience, \nand perhaps more interest. Some of us adjust our lives around the \nexpectation of opportunities. And sometimes, even for goal-driven \nbehavior, we try to create world events that will ensure that the \nsequence gets completed. For example, sometimes when I must do \nan important task, I ask someone to set a deadline for me. I use the \napproach of that deadline to trigger the work. It may only be a few \nhours before the deadline that I actually get to work and do the job, \nbut the important point is that it does get done. This self-triggering \nof external drivers is fully compatible with the seven-stage analysis.\nThe seven stages provide a guideline for developing new prod-\nucts or services. The gulfs are obvious places to start, for either gulf, \nwhether of execution or evaluation, is an opportunity for product \nenhancement. The trick is to develop observational skills to detect \nthem. Most innovation is done as an incremental enhancement of \nexisting products. What about radical ideas, ones that introduce \nnew product categories to the marketplace? These come about by \nreconsidering the goals, and always asking what the real goal is: \nwhat is called the root cause analysis.\nHarvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt \nonce pointed out, “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. \n\n\n44 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nThey want a quarter-inch hole!” Levitt’s example of the drill im-\nplying that the goal is really a hole is only partially correct, how-\never. When people go to a store to buy a drill, that is not their real \ngoal. But why would anyone want a quarter-inch hole? Clearly \nthat is an intermediate goal. Perhaps they wanted to hang shelves \non the wall. Levitt stopped too soon.\nOnce you realize that they don’t really want the drill, you realize \nthat perhaps they don’t really want the hole, either: they want to \ninstall their bookshelves. Why not develop methods that don’t re-\nquire holes? Or perhaps books that don’t require bookshelves. (Yes, \nI know: electronic books, e-books.)\nHuman Thought: Mostly Subconscious\nWhy do we need to know about the human mind? Because things \nare designed to be used by people, and without a deep under-\nstanding of people, the designs are apt to be faulty, difficult to \nuse, difficult to understand. That is why it is useful to consider the \nseven stages of action. The mind is more difficult to comprehend \nthan actions. Most of us start by believing we already understand \nboth human behavior and the human mind. After all, we are all hu-\nman: we have all lived with ourselves all of our lives, and we like \nto think we understand ourselves. But the truth is, we don’t. Most \nof human behavior is a result of subconscious processes. We are \nunaware of them. As a result, many of our beliefs about how peo-\nple behave—including beliefs about ourselves—are wrong. That is \nwhy we have the multiple social and behavioral sciences, with a \ngood dash of mathematics, economics, computer science, informa-\ntion science, and neuroscience.\nConsider the following simple experiment. Do all three steps:\n1. Wiggle the second finger of your hand.\n2. Wiggle the third finger of the same hand.\n3. Describe what you did differently those two times.\nOn the surface, the answer seems simple: I thought about mov-\ning my fingers and they moved. The difference is that I thought \n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n45\nabout a different finger each time. Yes, that’s true. But how did that \nthought get transmitted into action, into the commands that caused \ndifferent muscles in the arm to control the tendons that wiggled \nthe fingers? This is completely hidden from consciousness.\nThe human mind is immensely complex, having evolved over \na long period with many specialized structures. The study of the \nmind is the subject of multiple disciplines, including the behav-\nioral and social sciences, cognitive science, neuroscience, philos-\nophy, and the information and computer sciences. Despite many \nadvances in our understanding, much still remains mysterious, yet \nto be learned. One of the mysteries concerns the nature of and dis-\ntinction between those activities that are conscious and those that \nare not. Most of the brain’s operations are subconscious, hidden \nbeneath our awareness. It is only the highest level, what I call re-\nflective, that is conscious.\nConscious attention is necessary to learn most things, but after \nthe initial learning, continued practice and study, sometimes for \nthousands of hours over a period of years, produces what psychol-\nogists call “overlearning,” Once skills have been overlearned, per-\nformance appears to be effortless, done automatically, with little or \nno awareness. For example, answer these questions:\nWhat is the phone number of a friend?\nWhat is Beethoven’s phone number?\nWhat is the capital of:\n • Brazil?\n • Wales?\n • The United States?\n • Estonia?\nThink about how you answered these questions. The answers \nyou knew come immediately to mind, but with no awareness of \nhow that happened. You simply “know” the answer. Even the ones \nyou got wrong came to mind without any awareness. You might \nhave been aware of some doubt, but not of how the name entered \nyour consciousness. As for the countries for which you didn’t \n",

Even if you knew you knew, but couldn’t \nquite recall it, you didn’t know how you knew that, or what was \nhappening as you tried to remember.\nYou might have had trouble with the phone number of a friend \nbecause most of us have turned over to our technology the job \nof remembering phone numbers. I don’t know anybody’s phone \nnumber—I barely remember my own. When I wish to call some-\none, I just do a quick search in my contact list and have the tele-\nphone place the call. Or I just push the “2” button on the phone \nfor a few seconds, which autodials my home. Or in my auto, I can \nsimply speak: “Call home.” What’s the number? I don’t know: my \ntechnology knows. Do we count our technology as an extension \nof our memory systems? Of our thought processes? Of our mind?\nWhat about Beethoven’s phone number? If I asked my computer, \nit would take a long time, because it would have to search all the \npeople I know to see whether any one of them was Beethoven. \nBut you immediately discarded the question as nonsensical. You \ndon’t personally know Beethoven. And anyway, he is dead. Be-\nsides, he died in the early 1800s and the phone wasn’t invented \nuntil the late 1800s. How do we know what we do not know so \nrapidly? Yet some things that we do know can take a long time to \nretrieve. For example, answer this:\nIn the house you lived in three houses ago, as you entered the front door, \nwas the doorknob on the left or right?\nNow you have to engage in conscious, reflective problem solv-\ning, first to retrieve just which house is being talked about, and \nthen what the correct answer is. Most people can determine the \nhouse, but have difficulty answering the question because they can \nreadily imagine the doorknob on both sides of the door. The way to \nsolve this problem is to imagine doing some activity, such as walk-\ning up to the front door while carrying heavy packages with both \nhands: how do you open the door? Alternatively, visualize yourself \ninside the house, rushing to the front door to open it for a visitor. \n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n47\nUsually one of these imagined scenarios provides the answer. But \nnote how different the memory retrieval for this question was from \nthe retrieval for the others. All these questions involved long-term \nmemory, but in very different ways. The earlier questions were \nmemory for factual information, what is called declarative memory. \nThe last question could have been answered factually, but is usu-\nally most easily answered by recalling the activities performed to \nopen the door. This is called procedural memory. I return to a discus-\nsion of human memory in Chapter 3.\nWalking, talking, reading. Riding a bicycle or driving a car. Sing-\ning. All of these skills take considerable time and practice to mas-\nter, but once mastered, they are often done quite automatically. For \nexperts, only especially difficult or unexpected situations require \nconscious attention.\nBecause we are only aware of the reflective level of conscious \nprocessing, we tend to believe that all human thought is con-\nscious. But it isn’t. We also tend to believe that thought can be \nseparated from emotion. This is also false. Cognition and emo-\ntion cannot be separated. Cognitive thoughts lead to emotions: \nemotions drive cognitive thoughts. The brain is structured to act \nupon the world, and every action carries with it expectations, and \nthese expectations drive emotions. That is why much of language \nis based on physical metaphors, why the body and its interaction \nwith the environment are essential components of human thought.\nEmotion is highly underrated. In fact, the emotional system is \na powerful information processing system that works in tandem \nwith cognition. Cognition attempts to make sense of the world: \nemotion assigns value. It is the emotional system that determines \nwhether a situation is safe or threatening, whether something that \nis happening is good or bad, desirable or not. Cognition provides \nunderstanding: emotion provides value judgments. A human with-\nout a working emotional system has difficulty making choices. A \nhuman without a cognitive system is dysfunctional.\nBecause much human behavior is subconscious—that is, it oc-\ncurs without conscious awareness—we often don’t know what we \nare about to do, say, or think until after we have done it. It’s as \n\n\n48 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nif we had two minds: the subconscious and the conscious, which \ndon’t always talk to each other. Not what you have been taught? \nTrue, nonetheless. More and more evidence is accumulating that \nwe use logic and reason after the fact, to justify our decisions to \nourselves (to our conscious minds) and to others. Bizarre? Yes, but \ndon’t protest: enjoy it.\nSubconscious thought matches patterns, finding the best possible \nmatch of one’s past experience to the current one. It proceeds rap-\nidly and automatically, without effort. Subconscious processing is \none of our strengths. It is good at detecting general trends, at recog-\nnizing the relationship between what we now experience and what \nhas happened in the past. And it is good at generalizing, at making \npredictions about the general trend, based on few examples. But \nsubconscious thought can find matches that are inappropriate or \nwrong, and it may not distinguish the common from the rare. Sub-\nconscious thought is biased toward regularity and structure, and it \nis limited in formal power. It may not be capable of symbolic ma-\nnipulation, of careful reasoning through a sequence of steps.\nConscious thought is quite different. It is slow and labored. \nHere is where we slowly ponder decisions, think through alter-\nnatives, compare different choices. Conscious thought considers \nfirst this approach, then that—comparing, rationalizing, finding \nexplanations. Formal logic, mathematics, decision theory: these are \nthe tools of conscious thought. Both conscious and subconscious \nmodes of thought are powerful and essential aspects of human life. \nBoth can provide insightful leaps and creative moments. And both \nare subject to errors, misconceptions, and failures.\nEmotion interacts with cognition biochemically, bathing the brain \nwith hormones, transmitted either through the bloodstream or \nthrough ducts in the brain, modifying the behavior of brain cells. \nHormones exert powerful biases on brain operation. Thus, in tense, \nthreatening situations, the emotional system triggers the release of \nhormones that bias the brain to focus upon relevant parts of the \nenvironment. The muscles tense in preparation for action. In calm, \nnonthreatening situations, the emotional system triggers the release \nof hormones that relax the muscles and bias the brain toward explo-\n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n49\nration and creativity. Now the brain is more apt to notice changes in \nthe environment, to be distracted by events, and to piece together \nevents and knowledge that might have seemed unrelated earlier.\nA positive emotional state is ideal for creative thought, but it is \nnot very well suited for getting things done. Too much, and we call \nthe person scatterbrained, flitting from one topic to another, unable \nto finish one thought before another comes to mind. A brain in a \nnegative emotional state provides focus: precisely what is needed \nto maintain attention on a task and finish it. Too much, however, \nand we get tunnel vision, where people are unable to look beyond \ntheir narrow point of view. Both the positive, relaxed state and the \nanxious, negative, and tense state are valuable and powerful tools \nfor human creativity and action. The extremes of both states, how-\never, can be dangerous.\nHuman Cognition and Emotion\nThe mind and brain are complex entities, still the topic of con-\nsiderable scientific research. One valuable explanation of the lev-\nels of processing within the brain, applicable to both cognitive \nand emotional processing, is to think of three different levels of \nprocessing, each quite different from the other, but all working \ntogether in concert. Although this is a gross oversimplification \nof the actual processing, it is a good enough approximation to \nprovide guidance in understanding human behavior. The approach \nI use here comes from my book Emotional Design. There, I suggested \nSubconscious \nConscious\nFast \nSlow\nAutomatic \nControlled\nMultiple resources \nLimited resources\nControls skilled behavior \n Invoked for novel situations: when \nlearning, when in danger, when \nthings go wrong\nTABLE 2.1. Subconscious and Conscious Systems of Cognition\n\n\n50 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nthat a useful approximate model of human cognition and emotion \nis to consider three levels of processing: visceral, behavioral, and \nreflective.\nTHE VISCERAL LEVEL\nThe most basic level of processing is called visceral. This is some-\ntimes referred to as “the lizard brain.” All people have the same ba-\nsic visceral responses. These are part of the basic protective mech-\nanisms of the human affective system, making quick judgments \nabout the environment: good or bad, safe or dangerous. The visceral \nsystem allows us to respond quickly and subconsciously, without \nconscious awareness or control. \nThe basic biology of the visceral \nsystem minimizes its ability to \nlearn. Visceral learning takes \nplace primarily by sensitization \nor desensitization through such \nmechanisms as adaptation and \nclassical conditioning. Visceral \nresponses are fast and automatic. \nThey give rise to the startle reflex \nfor novel, unexpected events; for \nsuch genetically programmed \nbehavior as fear of heights, dis-\nlike of the dark or very noisy \nenvironments, dislike of bitter \ntastes and the liking of sweet tastes, and so on. Note that the visceral \nlevel responds to the immediate present and produces an affective \nstate, relatively unaffected by context or history. It simply assesses \nthe situation: no cause is assigned, no blame, and no credit.\nThe visceral level is tightly coupled to the body’s musculature—\nthe motor system. This is what causes animals to fight or flee, or to \nrelax. An animal’s (or person’s) visceral state can often be read by \nanalyzing the tension of the body: tense means a negative state; re-\nlaxed, a positive state. Note, too, that we often determine our own \nbody state by noting our own musculature. A common self-report \nFIGURE 2.3. Three Levels of Process-\ning: Visceral, Behavioral, and Reflective. \nVisceral and behavioral levels are subcon-\nscious and the home of basic emotions. \nThe reflective level is where conscious \nthought and decision-making reside, as \nwell as the highest level of emotions.\n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n51\nmight be something like, “I was tense, my fists clenched, and I \nwas sweating.”\nVisceral responses are fast and completely subconscious. They \nare sensitive only to the current state of things. Most scientists do \nnot call these emotions: they are precursors to emotion. Stand at \nthe edge of a cliff and you will experience a visceral response. Or \nbask in the warm, comforting glow after a pleasant experience, \nperhaps a nice meal.\nFor designers, the visceral response is about immediate per-\nception: the pleasantness of a mellow, harmonious sound or the \njarring, irritating scratch of fingernails on a rough surface. Here \nis where the style matters: appearances, whether sound or sight, \ntouch or smell, drive the visceral response. This has nothing to do \nwith how usable, effective, or understandable the product is. It is \nall about attraction or repulsion. Great designers use their aesthetic \nsensibilities to drive these visceral responses.\nEngineers and other logical people tend to dismiss the visceral \nresponse as irrelevant. Engineers are proud of the inherent qual-\nity of their work and dismayed when inferior products sell better \n“just because they look better.” But all of us make these kinds of \njudgments, even those very logical engineers. That’s why they love \nsome of their tools and dislike others. Visceral responses matter.\nTHE BEHAVIORAL LEVEL\nThe behavioral level is the home of learned skills, triggered by sit-\nuations that match the appropriate patterns. Actions and analyses \nat this level are largely subconscious. Even though we are usually \naware of our actions, we are often unaware of the details. When we \nspeak, we often do not know what we are about to say until our \nconscious mind (the reflective part of the mind) hears ourselves \nuttering the words. When we play a sport, we are prepared for ac-\ntion, but our responses occur far too quickly for conscious control: \nit is the behavioral level that takes control.\nWhen we perform a well-learned action, all we have to do is \nthink of the goal and the behavioral level handles all the details: \nthe conscious mind has little or no awareness beyond creating the \n\n\n52 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\ndesire to act. It’s actually interesting to keep trying it. Move the left \nhand, then the right. Stick out your tongue, or open your mouth. \nWhat did you do? You don’t know. All you know is that you \n“willed” the action and the correct thing happened. You can even \nmake the actions more complex. Pick up a cup, and then with the \nsame hand, pick up several more items. You automatically adjust \nthe fingers and the hand’s orientation to make the task possible. \nYou only need to pay conscious attention if the cup holds some liq-\nuid that you wish to avoid spilling. But even in that case, the actual \ncontrol of the muscles is beneath conscious perception: concentrate \non not spilling and the hands automatically adjust.\nFor designers, the most critical aspect of the behavioral level is \nthat every action is associated with an expectation. Expect a positive \noutcome and the result is a positive affective response (a “posi-\ntive valence,” in the scientific literature). Expect a negative outcome \nand the result is a negative affective response (a negative valence): \ndread and hope, anxiety and anticipation. The information in the \nfeedback loop of evaluation confirms or disconfirms the expecta-\ntions, resulting in satisfaction or relief, disappointment or frustration.\nBehavioral states are learned. They give rise to a feeling of con-\ntrol when there is good understanding and knowledge of results, \nand frustration and anger when things do not go as planned, and \nespecially when neither the reason nor the possible remedies are \nknown. Feedback provides reassurance, even when it indicates a \nnegative result. A lack of feedback creates a feeling of lack of con-\ntrol, which can be unsettling. Feedback is critical to managing ex-\npectations, and good design provides this. Feedback—knowledge \nof results—is how expectations are resolved and is critical to learn-\ning and the development of skilled behavior.\nExpectations play an important role in our emotional lives. This \nis why drivers tense when trying to get through an intersection be-\nfore the light turns red, or students become highly anxious before \nan exam. The release of the tension of expectation creates a sense of \nrelief. The emotional system is especially responsive to changes in \nstates—so an upward change is interpreted positively even if it is \nonly from a very bad state to a not-so-bad state, just as a change is \n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n53\ninterpreted negatively even if it is from an extremely positive state \nto one only somewhat less positive.\nTHE REFLECTIVE LEVEL\nThe reflective level is the home of conscious cognition. As a conse-\nquence, this is where deep understanding develops, where reason-\ning and conscious decision-making take place. The visceral and \nbehavioral levels are subconscious and, as a result, they respond \nrapidly, but without much analysis. Reflection is cognitive, deep, \nand slow. It often occurs after the events have happened. It is a re-\nflection or looking back over them, evaluating the circumstances, \nactions, and outcomes, often assessing blame or responsibility. The \nhighest levels of emotions come from the reflective level, for it is \nhere that causes are assigned and where predictions of the future \ntake place. Adding causal elements to experienced events leads to \nsuch emotional states as guilt and pride (when we assume our-\nselves to be the cause) and blame and praise (when others are \nthought to be the cause). Most of us have probably experienced the \nextreme highs and lows of anticipated future events, all imagined \nby a runaway reflective cognitive system but intense enough to \ncreate the physiological responses associated with extreme anger \nor pleasure. Emotion and cognition are tightly intertwined.\nDESIGN MUST TAKE PLACE AT ALL LEVELS: \nVISCERAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND REFLECTIVE\nTo the designer, reflection is perhaps the most important of the \nlevels of processing. Reflection is conscious, and the emotions \nproduced at this level are the most protracted: those that assign \nagency and cause, such as guilt and blame or praise and pride. Re-\nflective responses are part of our memory of events. Memories last \nfar longer than the immediate experience or the period of usage, \nwhich are the domains of the visceral and behavioral levels. It is \nreflection that drives us to recommend a product, to recommend \nthat others use it—or perhaps to avoid it.\nReflective memories are often more important than reality. If \nwe have a strongly positive visceral response but disappointing \n",

Similarly, too much frustration, especially toward the ending \nstage of use, and our reflections about the experience might over-\nlook the positive visceral qualities. Advertisers hope that the strong \nreflective value associated with a well-known, highly prestigious \nbrand might overwhelm our judgment, despite a frustrating expe-\nrience in using the product. Vacations are often remembered with \nfondness, despite the evidence from diaries of repeated discomfort \nand anguish.\nAll three levels of processing work together. All play essential \nroles in determining a person’s like or dislike of a product or ser-\nvice. One nasty experience with a service provider can spoil all \nfuture experiences. One superb experience can make up for past \ndeficiencies. The behavioral level, which is the home of interaction, \nis also the home of all expectation-based emotions, of hope and joy, \nfrustration and anger. Understanding arises at a combination of \nthe behavioral and reflective levels. Enjoyment requires all three. \nDesigning at all three levels is so important that I devote an entire \nbook to the topic, Emotional Design.\nIn psychology, there has been a long debate about which hap-\npens first: emotion or cognition. Do we run and flee because some \nevent happened that made us afraid? Or are we afraid because \nour conscious, reflective mind notices that we are running? The \nthree-level analysis shows that both of these ideas can be correct. \nSometimes the emotion comes first. An unexpected loud noise can \ncause automatic visceral and behavioral responses that make us \nflee. Then, the reflective system observes itself fleeing and deduces \nthat it is afraid. The actions of running and fleeing occur first and \nset off the interpretation of fear.\nBut sometimes cognition occurs first. Suppose the street where \nwe are walking leads to a dark and narrow section. Our reflective \nsystem might conjure numerous imagined threats that await us. \nAt some point, the imagined depiction of potential harm is large \n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n55\nenough to trigger the behavioral system, causing us to turn, run, and \nflee. Here is where the cognition sets off the fear and the action.\nMost products do not cause fear, running, or fleeing, but badly \ndesigned devices can induce frustration and anger, a feeling of \nhelplessness and despair, and possibly even hate. Well-designed \ndevices can induce pride and enjoyment, a feeling of being in con-\ntrol and pleasure—possibly even love and attachment. Amuse-\nment parks are experts at balancing the conflicting responses of \nthe emotional stages, providing rides and fun houses that trigger \nfear responses from the visceral and behavioral levels, while all \nthe time providing reassurance at the reflective level that the park \nwould never subject anyone to real danger.\nAll three levels of processing work together to determine a per-\nson’s cognitive and emotional state. High-level reflective cognition \ncan trigger lower-level emotions. Lower-level emotions can trigger \nhigher-level reflective cognition.\nThe Seven Stages of Action \nand the Three Levels of Processing\nThe stages of action can readily be associated with the three differ-\nent levels of processing, as shown in Figure 2.4. At the lowest level \nare the visceral levels of calmness or anxiety when approaching a \ntask or evaluating the state of the world. Then, in the middle level, \nare the behavioral ones driven by expectations on the execution \nside—for example, hope and fear—and emotions driven by the \nconfirmation of those expectations on the evaluation side—for ex-\nample, relief or despair. At the highest level are the reflective emo-\ntions, ones that assess the results in terms of the presumed causal \nagents and the consequences, both immediate and long-term. Here \nis where satisfaction and pride occur, or perhaps blame and anger.\nOne important emotional state is the one that accompanies com-\nplete immersion into an activity, a state that the social scientist \nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi has labeled “flow.” Csikszentmihalyi \nhas long studied how people interact with their work and play, \nand how their lives reflect this intermix of activities. When in the \nflow state, people lose track of time and the outside environment. \n\n\n56 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nThey are at one with the task \nthey are performing. The task, \nmoreover, is at just the proper \nlevel of difficulty: difficult \nenough to provide a challenge \nand require continued atten-\ntion, but not so difficult that it \ninvokes frustration and anxiety.\nCsikszentmihalyi’s work \nshows how the behavioral \nlevel creates a powerful set of \nemotional responses. Here, the \nsubconscious expectations es-\ntablished by the execution side \nof the action cycle set up emo-\ntional states dependent upon \nthose expectations. When the \nresults of our actions are eval-\nuated against expectations, the \nresulting emotions affect our \nfeelings as we continue through \nthe many cycles of action. An easy task, far below our skill level, makes \nit so easy to meet expectations that there is no challenge. Very little or \nno processing effort is required, which leads to apathy or boredom. A \ndifficult task, far above our skill, leads to so many failed expectations \nthat it causes frustration, anxiety, and helplessness. The flow state oc-\ncurs when the challenge of the activity just slightly exceeds our skill \nlevel, so full attention is continually required. Flow requires that the \nactivity be neither too easy nor too difficult relative to our level of skill. \nThe constant tension coupled with continual progress and success can \nbe an engaging, immersive experience sometimes lasting for hours.\nPeople as Storytellers\nNow that we have explored the way that actions get done and the \nthree different levels of processing that integrate cognition and \nemotion, we are ready to look at some of the implications.\nFIGURE 2.4. Levels of Processing and the \nStages of the Action Cycle. Visceral response is \nat the lowest level: the control of simple muscles \nand sensing the state of the world and body. The \nbehavioral level is about expectations, so it is sen-\nsitive to the expectations of the action sequence \nand then the interpretations of the feedback. The \nreflective level is a part of the goal- and plan-set-\nting activity as well as affected by the comparison \nof expectations with what has actually happened.\n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n57\nPeople are innately disposed to look for causes of events, to form \nexplanations and stories. That is one reason storytelling is such \na persuasive medium. Stories resonate with our experiences and \nprovide examples of new instances. From our experiences and the \nstories of others we tend to form generalizations about the way \npeople behave and things work. We attribute causes to events, and \nas long as these cause-and-effect pairings make sense, we accept \nthem and use them for understanding future events. Yet these \ncausal attributions are often erroneous. Sometimes they implicate \nthe wrong causes, and for some things that happen, there is no \nsingle cause; rather, a complex chain of events that all contribute \nto the result: if any one of the events would not have occurred, the \nresult would be different. But even when there is no single causal \nact, that doesn’t stop people from assigning one. \nConceptual models are a form of story, resulting from our predis-\nposition to find explanations. These models are essential in helping \nus understand our experiences, predict the outcome of our actions, \nand handle unexpected occurrences. We base our models on what-\never knowledge we have, real or imaginary, naive or sophisticated.\nConceptual models are often constructed from fragmentary evi-\ndence, with only a poor understanding of what is happening, and \nwith a kind of naive psychology that postulates causes, mecha-\nnisms, and relationships even where there are none. Some faulty \nmodels lead to the frustrations of everyday life, as in the case of my \nunsettable refrigerator, where my conceptual model of its opera-\ntion (see again Figure 1.10A) did not correspond to reality (Figure \n1.10B). Far more serious are faulty models of such complex sys-\ntems as an industrial plant or passenger airplane. Misunderstand-\ning there can lead to devastating accidents.\nConsider the thermostat that controls room heating and cooling \nsystems. How does it work? The average thermostat offers almost \nno evidence of its operation except in a highly roundabout man-\nner. All we know is that if the room is too cold, we set a higher \ntemperature into the thermostat. Eventually we feel warmer. Note \nthat the same thing applies to the temperature control for almost \nany device whose temperature is to be regulated. Want to bake a \n\n\n58 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\ncake? Set the oven thermostat and the oven goes to the desired \ntemperature.\nIf you are in a cold room, in a hurry to get warm, will the room \nheat more quickly if you turn the thermostat to its maximum set-\nting? Or if you want the oven to reach its working temperature \nfaster, should you turn the temperature dial all the way to maxi-\nmum, then turn it down once the desired temperature is reached? \nOr to cool a room most quickly, should you set the air conditioner \nthermostat to its lowest temperature setting?\nIf you think that the room or oven will cool or heat faster if the \nthermostat is turned all the way to the maximum setting, you are \nwrong—you hold an erroneous folk theory of the heating and cool-\ning system. One commonly held folk theory of the working of a \nthermostat is that it is like a valve: the thermostat controls how \nmuch heat (or cold) comes out of the device. Hence, to heat or cool \nsomething most quickly, set the thermostat so that the device is on \nmaximum. The theory is reasonable, and there exist devices that \noperate like this, but neither the heating or cooling equipment for a \nhome nor the heating element of a traditional oven is one of them.\nIn most homes, the thermostat is just an on-off switch. Moreover, \nmost heating and cooling devices are either fully on or fully off: \nall or nothing, with no in-between states. As a result, the thermo-\nstat turns the heater, oven, or air conditioner completely on, at full \npower, until the temperature setting on the thermostat is reached. \nThen it turns the unit completely off. Setting the thermostat at \none extreme cannot affect how long it takes to reach the desired \ntemperature. Worse, because this bypasses the automatic shutoff \nwhen the desired temperature is reached, setting it at the extremes \ninvariably means that the temperature overshoots the target. If \npeople were uncomfortably cold or hot before, they will become \nuncomfortable in the other direction, wasting considerable energy \nin the process.\nBut how are you to know? What information helps you under-\nstand how the thermostat works? The design problem with the \nrefrigerator is that there are no aids to understanding, no way of \n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n59\nforming the correct conceptual model. In fact, the information \nprovided misleads people into forming the wrong, quite inap-\npropriate model.\nThe real point of these examples is not that some people have er-\nroneous beliefs; it is that everyone forms stories (conceptual mod-\nels) to explain what they have observed. In the absence of external \ninformation, people can let their imagination run free as long as \nthe conceptual models they develop account for the facts as they \nperceive them. As a result, people use their thermostats inappro-\npriately, causing themselves unnecessary effort, and often resulting \nin large temperature swings, thus wasting energy, which is both a \nneedless expense and bad for the environment. (Later in this chap-\nter, page 69, I provide an example of a thermostat that does pro-\nvide a useful conceptual model.)\nBlaming the Wrong Things\nPeople try to find causes for events. They tend to assign a causal re-\nlation whenever two things occur in succession. If some unexpected \nevent happens in my home just after I have taken some action, I am \napt to conclude that it was caused by that action, even if there really \nwas no relationship between the two. Similarly, if I do something ex-\npecting a result and nothing happens, I am apt to interpret this lack \nof informative feedback as an indication that I didn’t do the action \ncorrectly: the most likely thing to do, therefore, is to repeat the action, \nonly with more force. Push a door and it fails to open? Push again, \nharder. With electronic devices, if the feedback is delayed sufficiently, \npeople often are led to conclude that the press wasn’t recorded, so \nthey do the same action again, sometimes repeatedly, unaware that \nall of their presses were recorded. This can lead to unintended results. \nRepeated presses might intensify the response much more than was \nintended. Alternatively, a second request might cancel the previous \none, so that an odd number of pushes produces the desired result, \nwhereas an even number leads to no result.\nThe tendency to repeat an action when the first attempt fails \ncan be disastrous. This has led to numerous deaths when people \n\n\n60 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\ntried to escape a burning building by attempting to push open exit \ndoors that opened inward, doors that should have been pulled. As \na result, in many countries, the law requires doors in public places \nto open outward, and moreover to be operated by so-called panic \nbars, so that they automatically open when people, in a panic to \nescape a fire, push their bodies against them. This is a great appli-\ncation of appropriate affordances: see the door in Figure 2.5.\nModern systems try hard to provide feedback within 0.1 second \nof any operation, to reassure the user that the request was received. \nThis is especially important if the operation will take considerable \ntime. The presence of a filling hourglass or rotating clock hands is \na reassuring sign that work is in progress. When the delay can be \npredicted, some systems provide time estimates as well as progress \nbars to indicate how far along the task has gone. More systems \nshould adopt these sensible displays to provide timely and mean-\ningful feedback of results.\nSome studies show it is wise to underpredict—that is, to say an \noperation will take longer than it actually will. When the system \ncomputes the amount of time, it can compute the range of possible \nFIGURE 2.5. Panic Bars on Doors. People fleeing a fire would die if they en-\ncountered exit doors that opened inward, because they would keep trying to push \nthem outward, and when that failed, they would push harder. The proper design, \nnow required by law in many places, is to change the design of doors so that they \nopen when pushed. Here is one example: an excellent design strategy for dealing \nwith real behavior by the use of the proper affordances coupled with a graceful \nsignifier, the black bar, which indicates where to push.

In that case it ought to display the range, or if only a single \nvalue is desirable, show the slowest, longest value. That way, the \nexpectations are liable to be exceeded, leading to a happy result.\nWhen it is difficult to determine the cause of a difficulty, where \ndo people put the blame? Often people will use their own concep-\ntual models of the world to determine the perceived causal rela-\ntionship between the thing being blamed and the result. The word \nperceived is critical: the causal relationship does not have to exist; \nthe person simply has to think it is there. Sometimes the result is \nto attribute cause to things that had nothing to do with the action.\nSuppose I try to use an everyday thing, but I can’t. Who is at \nfault: me or the thing? We are apt to blame ourselves, especially if \nothers are able to use it. Suppose the fault really lies in the device, \nso that lots of people have the same problems. Because everyone \nperceives the fault to be his or her own, nobody wants to admit \nto having trouble. This creates a conspiracy of silence, where the \nfeelings of guilt and helplessness among people are kept hidden.\nInterestingly enough, the common tendency to blame ourselves \nfor failures with everyday objects goes against the normal attribu-\ntions we make about ourselves and others. Everyone sometimes \nacts in a way that seems strange, bizarre, or simply wrong and \ninappropriate. When we do this, we tend to attribute our behavior \nto the environment. When we see others do it, we tend to attribute \nit to their personalities.\nHere is a made-up example. Consider Tom, the office terror. To-\nday, Tom got to work late, yelled at his colleagues because the of-\nfice coffee machine was empty, then ran to his office and slammed \nthe door shut. “Ah,” his colleagues and staff say to one another, \n“there he goes again.”\nNow consider Tom’s point of view. “I really had a hard day,” Tom \nexplains. “I woke up late because my alarm clock failed to go off: I \ndidn’t even have time for my morning coffee. Then I couldn’t find \na parking spot because I was late. And there wasn’t any coffee in \nthe office machine; it was all out. None of this was my fault—I had \na run of really bad events. Yes, I was a bit curt, but who wouldn’t \nbe under the same circumstances?”\n",

All they see is that Tom yelled at them simply \nbecause the office coffee machine was empty. This reminds them of \nanother similar event. “He does that all the time,” they conclude, \n“always blowing up over the most minor things.” Who is correct? \nTom or his colleagues? The events can be seen from two differ-\nent points of view with two different interpretations: common re-\nsponses to the trials of life or the result of an explosive, irascible \npersonality.\nIt seems natural for people to blame their own misfortunes on \nthe environment. It seems equally natural to blame other people’s \nmisfortunes on their personalities. Just the opposite attribution, by \nthe way, is made when things go well. When things go right, peo-\nple credit their own abilities and intelligence. The onlookers do \nthe reverse. When they see things go well for someone else, they \nsometimes credit the environment, or luck.\nIn all such cases, whether a person is inappropriately accepting \nblame for the inability to work simple objects or attributing be-\nhavior to environment or personality, a faulty conceptual model is \nat work.\nLEARNED HELPLESSNESS\nThe phenomenon called learned helplessness might help explain the \nself-blame. It refers to the situation in which people experience re-\npeated failure at a task. As a result, they decide that the task cannot \nbe done, at least not by them: they are helpless. They stop trying. \nIf this feeling covers a group of tasks, the result can be severe diffi-\nculties coping with life. In the extreme case, such learned helpless-\nness leads to depression and to a belief that the individuals cannot \ncope with everyday life at all. Sometimes all it takes to get such a \nfeeling of helplessness are a few experiences that accidentally turn \nout bad. The phenomenon has been most frequently studied as a \nprecursor to the clinical problem of depression, but I have seen it \nhappen after a few bad experiences with everyday objects.\nDo common technology and mathematics phobias result from \na kind of learned helplessness? Could a few instances of failure \n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n63\nin what appear to be straightforward situations generalize to ev-\nery technological object, every mathematics problem? Perhaps. In \nfact, the design of everyday things (and the design of mathematics \ncourses) seems almost guaranteed to cause this. We could call this \nphenomenon taught helplessness.\nWhen people have trouble using technology, especially when \nthey perceive (usually incorrectly) that nobody else is having the \nsame problems, they tend to blame themselves. Worse, the more \nthey have trouble, the more helpless they may feel, believing that \nthey must be technically or mechanically inept. This is just the op-\nposite of the more normal situation where people blame their own \ndifficulties on the environment. This false blame is especially ironic \nbecause the culprit here is usually the poor design of the technol-\nogy, so blaming the environment (the technology) would be com-\npletely appropriate.\nConsider the normal mathematics curriculum, which continues \nrelentlessly on its way, each new lesson assuming full knowledge \nand understanding of all that has passed before. Even though each \npoint may be simple, once you fall behind it is hard to catch up. \nThe result: mathematics phobia—not because the material is diffi-\ncult, but because it is taught so that difficulty in one stage hinders \nfurther progress. The problem is that once failure starts, it is soon \ngeneralized by self-blame to all of mathematics. Similar processes \nare at work with technology. The vicious cycle starts: if you fail \nat something, you think it is your fault. Therefore you think you \ncan’t do that task. As a result, next time you have to do the task, \nyou believe you can’t, so you don’t even try. The result is that you \ncan’t, just as you thought.\nYou’re trapped in a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nPOSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY\nJust as we learn to give up after repeated failure, we can learn op-\ntimistic, positive responses to life. For years, psychologists focused \nupon the gloomy story of how people failed, on the limits of hu-\nman abilities, and on psychopathologies—depression, mania, para-\nnoia, and so on. But the twenty-first century sees a new approach: \n\n\n64 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nto focus upon a positive psychology, a culture of positive thinking, \nof feeling good about oneself. In fact, the normal emotional state \nof most people is positive. When something doesn’t work, it can \nbe considered an interesting challenge, or perhaps just a positive \nlearning experience.\nWe need to remove the word failure from our vocabulary, replac-\ning it instead with learning experience. To fail is to learn: we learn \nmore from our failures than from our successes. With success, sure, \nwe are pleased, but we often have no idea why we succeeded. With \nfailure, it is often possible to figure out why, to ensure that it will \nnever happen again.\nScientists know this. Scientists do experiments to learn how the \nworld works. Sometimes their experiments work as expected, but \noften they don’t. Are these failures? No, they are learning expe-\nriences. Many of the most important scientific discoveries have \ncome from these so-called failures.\nFailure can be such a powerful learning tool that many designers \ntake pride in their failures that happen while a product is still in \ndevelopment. One design firm, IDEO, has it as a creed: “Fail often, \nfail fast,” they say, for they know that each failure teaches them a \nlot about what to do right. Designers need to fail, as do research-\ners. I have long held the belief—and encouraged it in my students \nand employees—that failures are an essential part of exploration \nand creativity. If designers and researchers do not sometimes fail, it \nis a sign that they are not trying hard enough—they are not think-\ning the great creative thoughts that will provide breakthroughs in \nhow we do things. It is possible to avoid failure, to always be safe. \nBut that is also the route to a dull, uninteresting life.\nThe designs of our products and services must also follow this \nphilosophy. So, to the designers who are reading this, let me give \nsome advice:\n• Do not blame people when they fail to use your products properly.\n•  Take people’s difficulties as signifiers of where the product can be \nimproved.\n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n65\n•  Eliminate all error messages from electronic or computer systems. \nInstead, provide help and guidance.\n•  Make it possible to correct problems directly from help and guidance \nmessages. Allow people to continue with their task: Don’t impede \nprogress—help make it smooth and continuous. Never make people \nstart over.\n•  Assume that what people have done is partially correct, so if it is \ninappropriate, provide the guidance that allows them to correct the \nproblem and be on their way.\n• Think positively, for yourself and for the people you interact with.\nFalsely Blaming Yourself\nI have studied people making errors—sometimes serious ones—\nwith mechanical devices, light switches and fuses, computer op-\nerating systems and word processors, even airplanes and nuclear \npower plants. Invariably people feel guilty and either try to hide \nthe error or blame themselves for “stupidity” or “clumsiness.” I \noften have difficulty getting permission to watch: nobody likes to \nbe observed performing badly. I point out that the design is faulty \nand that others make the same errors, yet if the task appears sim-\nple or trivial, people still blame themselves. It is almost as if they \ntake perverse pride in thinking of themselves as mechanically \nincompetent.\nI once was asked by a large computer company to evaluate a \nbrand-new product. I spent a day learning to use it and trying \nit out on various problems. In using the keyboard to enter data, it \nwas necessary to differentiate between the Return key and the En-\nter key. If the wrong key was pressed, the last few minutes’ work \nwas irrevocably lost.\nI pointed out this problem to the designer, explaining that I, \nmyself, had made the error frequently and that my analyses indi-\ncated that this was very likely to be a frequent error among users. \nThe designer’s first response was: “Why did you make that error? \nDidn’t you read the manual?” He proceeded to explain the differ-\nent functions of the two keys.\n\n\n66 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\n“Yes, yes,” I explained, “I understand the two keys, I simply confuse \nthem. They have similar functions, are located in similar locations on \nthe keyboard, and as a skilled typist, I often hit Return automatically, \nwithout thought. Certainly others have had similar problems.”\n“Nope,” said the designer. He claimed that I was the only per-\nson who had ever complained, and the company’s employees had \nbeen using the system for many months. I was skeptical, so we \nwent together to some of the employees and asked them whether \nthey had ever hit the Return key when they should have hit Enter. \nAnd did they ever lose their work as a result?\n“Oh, yes,” they said, “we do that a lot.”\nWell, how come nobody ever said anything about it? After all, \nthey were encouraged to report all problems with the system. The \nreason was simple: when the system stopped working or did some-\nthing strange, they dutifully reported it as a problem. But when \nthey made the Return versus Enter error, they blamed themselves. \nAfter all, they had been told what to do. They had simply erred.\nThe idea that a person is at fault when something goes wrong is \ndeeply entrenched in society. That’s why we blame others and even \nourselves. Unfortunately, the idea that a person is at fault is imbed-\nded in the legal system. When major accidents occur, official courts \nof inquiry are set up to assess the blame. More and more often the \nblame is attributed to “human error.” The person involved can \nbe fined, punished, or fired. Maybe training procedures are revised. \nThe law rests comfortably. But in my experience, human error usually \nis a result of poor design: it should be called system error. Humans \nerr continually; it is an intrinsic part of our nature. System design \nshould take this into account. Pinning the blame on the person may \nbe a comfortable way to proceed, but why was the system ever de-\nsigned so that a single act by a single person could cause calamity? \nWorse, blaming the person without fixing the root, underlying cause \ndoes not fix the problem: the same error is likely to be repeated by \nsomeone else. I return to the topic of human error in Chapter 5.\nOf course, people do make errors. Complex devices will always \nrequire some instruction, and someone using them without in-\nstruction should expect to make errors and to be confused. But \n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n67\ndesigners should take special pains to make errors as cost-free as \npossible. Here is my credo about errors:\nEliminate the term human error. Instead, talk about communica-\ntion and interaction: what we call an error is usually bad commu-\nnication or interaction. When people collaborate with one anoth-\ner, the word error is never used to characterize another person’s \nutterance. That’s because each person is trying to understand \nand respond to the other, and when something is not understood \nor seems inappropriate, it is questioned, clarified, and the collab-\noration continues. Why can’t the interaction between a person \nand a machine be thought of as collaboration?\nMachines are not people. They can’t communicate and under-\nstand the same way we do. This means that their designers have \na special obligation to ensure that the behavior of machines is un-\nderstandable to the people who interact with them. True collabo-\nration requires each party to make some effort to accommodate \nand understand the other. When we collaborate with machines, it \nis people who must do all the accommodation. Why shouldn’t the \nmachine be more friendly? The machine should accept normal hu-\nman behavior, but just as people often subconsciously assess the \naccuracy of things being said, machines should judge the quality of \ninformation given it, in this case to help its operators avoid griev-\nous errors because of simple slips (discussed in Chapter 5). Today, \nwe insist that people perform abnormally, to adapt themselves to \nthe peculiar demands of machines, which includes always giving \nprecise, accurate information. Humans are particularly bad at this, \nyet when they fail to meet the arbitrary, inhuman requirements of \nmachines, we call it human error. No, it is design error.\nDesigners should strive to minimize the chance of inappro-\npriate actions in the first place by using affordances, signifiers, \ngood mapping, and constraints to guide the actions. If a person \nperforms an inappropriate action, the design should maximize \nthe chance that this can be discovered and then rectified. This \nrequires good, intelligible feedback coupled with a simple, clear \nconceptual model. When people understand what has happened, \nwhat state the system is in, and what the most appropriate set of \nactions is, they can perform their activities more effectively.\n\n\n68 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nPeople are not machines. Machines don’t have to deal with \ncontinual interruptions. People are subjected to continual inter-\nruptions. As a result, we are often bouncing back and forth be-\ntween tasks, having to recover our place, what we were doing, \nand what we were thinking when we return to a previous task. \nNo wonder we sometimes forget our place when we return to the \noriginal task, either skipping or repeating a step, or imprecisely \nretaining the information we were about to enter.\nOur strengths are in our flexibility and creativity, in coming up \nwith solutions to novel problems. We are creative and imaginative, \nnot mechanical and precise. Machines require precision and accu-\nracy; people don’t. And we are particularly bad at providing precise \nand accurate inputs. So why are we always required to do so? Why \ndo we put the requirements of machines above those of people?\nWhen people interact with machines, things will not always \ngo smoothly. This is to be expected. So designers should antici-\npate this. It is easy to design devices that work well when every-\nthing goes as planned. The hard and necessary part of design is to \nmake things work well even when things do not go as planned.\nHOW TECHNOLOGY CAN ACCOMMODATE HUMAN BEHAVIOR\nIn the past, cost prevented many manufacturers from providing \nuseful feedback that would assist people in forming accurate \nconceptual models. The cost of color displays large and flexible \nenough to provide the required information was prohibitive for \nsmall, inexpensive devices. But as the cost of sensors and displays \nhas dropped, it is now possible to do a lot more.\nThanks to display screens, telephones are much easier to use than \never before, so my extensive criticisms of phones found in the earlier \nedition of this book have been removed. I look forward to great im-\nprovements in all our devices now that the importance of these de-\nsign principles are becoming recognized and the enhanced quality \nand lower costs of displays make it possible to implement the ideas.\nPROV IDING A CONC EP T UAL MODEL FOR A HOME T HER MOSTAT\nMy thermostat, for example (designed by Nest Labs), has a colorful \ndisplay that is normally off, turning on only when it senses that I \n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n69\nam nearby. Then it provides me with the current temperature of \nthe room, the temperature to which it is set, and whether it is heat-\ning or cooling the room (the background color changes from black \nwhen it is neither heating nor cooling, to orange while heating, or \nto blue while cooling). It learns my daily patterns, so it changes \ntemperature automatically, lowering it at bedtime, raising it again \nin the morning, and going into “away” mode when it detects that \nnobody is in the house. All the time, it explains what it is doing. \nThus, when it has to change the room temperature substantially \n(either because someone has entered a manual change or because \nit has decided that it is now time to switch), it gives a prediction: \n“Now 75°, will be 72° in 20 minutes.” In addition, Nest can be con-\nnected wirelessly to smart devices that allow for remote operation \nof the thermostat and also for larger screens to provide a detailed \nanalysis of its performance, aiding the home occupant’s develop-\nment of a conceptual model both of Nest and also of the home’s en-\nergy consumption. Is Nest perfect? No, but it marks improvement \nin the collaborative interaction of people and everyday things.\nFIGURE 2.6. A Thermostat with an Explicit Concep-\ntual Model. This thermostat, manufactured by Nest Labs, \nhelps people form a good conceptual model of its opera-\ntion. Photo A shows the thermostat. The background, blue, \nindicates that it is now cooling the home. The current tem-\nperature is 75°F (24°C) and the target temperature is 72°F \n(22°C), which it expects to reach in 20 minutes. Photo B \nshows its use of a smart phone to deliver a summary of its \nsettings and the home’s energy use. Both A and B combine \nto help the home dweller develop conceptual models of \nthe thermostat and the home’s energy consumption. (Pho-\ntographs courtesy of Nest Labs, Inc.)\nA.\nB.\n",

In other words: inappropriate program-\nming. Consider these examples.\nMany of us spend hours filling out forms on computers—forms \nthat require names, dates, addresses, telephone numbers, mone-\ntary sums, and other information in a fixed, rigid format. Worse, \noften we are not even told the correct format until we get it wrong. \nWhy not figure out the variety of ways a person might fill out a \nform and accommodate all of them? Some companies have done \nexcellent jobs at this, so let us celebrate their actions.\nConsider Microsoft’s calendar program. Here, it is possible to \nspecify dates any way you like: “November 23, 2015,” “23 Nov. \n15,” or “11.23.15.” It even accepts phrases such as “a week from \nThursday,” “tomorrow,” “a week from tomorrow,” or “yesterday.” \nSame with time. You can enter the time any way you want: “3:45 \nPM,” “15.35,” “an hour,” “two and one-half hours.” Same with \ntelephone numbers: Want to start with a + sign (to indicate the code \nfor international dialing)? No problem. Like to separate the num-\nber fields with spaces, dashes, parentheses, slashes, periods? No \nproblem. As long as the program can decipher the date, time, or \ntelephone number into a legal format, it is accepted. I hope the \nteam that worked on this got bonuses and promotions.\nAlthough I single out Microsoft for being the pioneer in accept-\ning a wide variety of formats, it is now becoming standard prac-\ntice. By the time you read this, I would hope that every program \nwould permit any intelligible format for names, dates, phone num-\nbers, street addresses, and so on, transforming whatever is entered \ninto whatever form the internal programming needs. But I predict \nthat even in the twenty-second century, there will still be forms \nthat require precise accurate (but arbitrary) formats for no reason \nexcept the laziness of the programming team. Perhaps in the years \nthat pass between this book’s publication and when you are read-\n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n71\ning this, great improvements will have been made. If we are all \nlucky, this section will be badly out of date. I hope so.\nThe Seven Stages of Action: \nSeven Fundamental Design Principles\nThe seven-stage model of the action cycle can be a valuable de-\nsign tool, for it provides a basic checklist of questions to ask. In \ngeneral, each stage of action requires its own special design strate-\ngies and, in turn, provides its own opportunity for disaster. Figure \n2.7 summarizes the questions:\n1. What do I want to accomplish?\n2.  What are the alternative action sequences?\n3.  What action can I do now?\n4.  How do I do it?\n5.  What happened?\n6.  What does it mean?\n7.  Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?\nAnyone using a product should always be able to determine the \nanswers to all seven questions. This puts the burden on the designer \nF IGU R E 2 .7. \nThe Seven \nStages of Action as Design \nAids. Each of the seven stages \nindicates a place where the \nperson using the system has a \nquestion. The seven questions \npose seven design themes. \nHow should the design con-\nvey the information required \nto answer the user’s question? \nThrough appropriate con-\nstraint and mappings, signi-\nfiers and conceptual models, \nfeedback and visibility. The \ninformation that helps answer \nquestions of execution (doing) \nis feedforward. The information \nthat aids in understanding \nwhat has happened is feedback.\n\n\n72 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nto ensure that at each stage, the product provides the information \nrequired to answer the question. \nThe information that helps answer questions of execution (do-\ning) is feedforward. The information that aids in understanding \nwhat has happened is feedback. Everyone knows what feedback is. \nIt helps you know what happened. But how do you know what \nyou can do? That’s the role of feedforward, a term borrowed from \ncontrol theory.\nFeedforward is accomplished through appropriate use of signi-\nfiers, constraints, and mappings. The conceptual model plays an \nimportant role. Feedback is accomplished through explicit infor-\nmation about the impact of the action. Once again, the conceptual \nmodel plays an important role.\nBoth feedback and feedforward need to be presented in a form that \nis readily interpreted by the people using the system. The presenta-\ntion has to match how people view the goal they are trying to achieve \nand their expectations. Information must match human needs.\nThe insights from the seven stages of action lead us to seven fun-\ndamental principles of design:\n1.  Discoverability. It is possible to determine what actions are possible \nand the current state of the device.\n2.  Feedback. There is full and continuous information about the results \nof actions and the current state of the product or service. After an \naction has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.\n3.  Conceptual model. The design projects all the information needed \nto create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to under-\nstanding and a feeling of control. The conceptual model enhances \nboth discoverability and evaluation of results.\n4.  Affordances. The proper affordances exist to make the desired ac-\ntions possible.\n5.  Signifiers. Effective use of signifiers ensures discoverability and that \nthe feedback is well communicated and intelligible.\n6.  Mappings. The relationship between controls and their actions fol-\nlows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as possible \nthrough spatial layout and temporal contiguity.\n\n\n \ntwo: The Psychology of Everyday Actions \n73\n7.  Constraints. Providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural con-\nstraints guides actions and eases interpretation.\nThe next time you can’t immediately figure out the shower con-\ntrol in a hotel room or have trouble using an unfamiliar television \nset or kitchen appliance, remember that the problem is in the de-\nsign. Ask yourself where the problem lies. At which of the seven \nstages of action does it fail? Which design principles are deficient?\nBut it is easy to find fault: the key is to be able to do things \nbetter. Ask yourself how the difficulty came about. Realize that \nmany different groups of people might have been involved, each \nof which might have had intelligent, sensible reasons for their ac-\ntions. For example, a troublesome bathroom shower was designed \nby people who were unable to know how it would be installed, \nthen the shower controls might have been selected by a building \ncontractor to fit the home plans provided by yet another person. \nFinally, a plumber, who may not have had contact with any of the \nother people, did the installation. Where did the problems arise? It \ncould have been at any one (or several) of these stages. The result \nmay appear to be poor design, but it may actually arise from poor \ncommunication.\nOne of my self-imposed rules is, “Don’t criticize unless you can \ndo better.” Try to understand how the faulty design might have \noccurred: try to determine how it could have been done otherwise. \nThinking about the causes and possible fixes to bad design should \nmake you better appreciate good design. So, the next time you \ncome across a well-designed object, one that you can use smoothly \nand effortlessly on the first try, stop and examine it. Consider how \nwell it masters the seven stages of action and the principles of de-\nsign. Recognize that most of our interactions with products are ac-\ntually interactions with a complex system: good design requires \nconsideration of the entire system to ensure that the requirements, \nintentions, and desires at each stage are faithfully understood and \nrespected at all the other stages.\n\n\n74 \nC H A P T E R  T H R E E\nC h a p t e r  T h r e e\nKNOWLEDGE \nIN THE \nHEAD AND IN \nTHE WORLD\nA friend kindly let me borrow his car, an older, classic Saab. Just before \nI was about to leave, I found a note waiting for me: “I should have \nmentioned that to get the key out of the ignition, the car needs to be in \nreverse.” The car needs to be in reverse! If I hadn’t seen the note, I never \ncould have figured that out. There was no visible cue in the car: the \nknowledge needed for this trick had to reside in the head. If the driver \nlacks that knowledge, the key stays in the ignition forever.\nEvery day we are confronted by numerous objects, \ndevices, and services, each of which requires us to \nbehave or act in some particular manner. Overall, we \nmanage quite well. Our knowledge is often quite in-\ncomplete, ambiguous, or even wrong, but that doesn’t matter: we \nstill get through the day just fine. How do we manage? We com-\nbine knowledge in the head with knowledge in the world. Why \ncombine? Because neither alone will suffice.\nIt is easy to demonstrate the faulty nature of human knowledge \nand memory. The psychologists Ray Nickerson and Marilyn Adams \nshowed that people do not remember what common coins look \nlike (Figure 3.1). Even though the example is for the American one-\ncent piece, the penny, the finding holds true for currencies across \nthe world. But despite our ignorance of the coins’ appearance, we \nuse our money properly.\nWhy the apparent discrepancy between the precision of behavior \nand the imprecision of knowledge? Because not all of the knowl-\n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n75\nedge required for precise behavior has to be in the head. It can be \ndistributed—partly in the head, partly in the world, and partly in \nthe constraints of the world.\nPrecise Behavior from Imprecise Knowledge\nPrecise behavior can emerge from imprecise knowledge for four \nreasons:\n1.  Knowledge is both in the head and in the world. Technically, \nknowledge can only be in the head, because knowledge requires in-\nterpretation and understanding, but once the world’s structure has \nbeen interpreted and understood, it counts as knowledge. Much of \nthe knowledge a person needs to do a task can be derived from the \ninformation in the world. Behavior is determined by combining the \nknowledge in the head with that in the world. For this chapter, I will \nuse the term “knowledge” for both what is in the head and what is \nin the world. Although technically imprecise, it simplifies the discus-\nsion and understanding.\nFIGURE 3.1. Which Is the US One-Cent Coin, the Penny? Fewer than half of the \nAmerican college students who were given this set of drawings and asked to select the \ncorrect image could do so. Pretty bad performance, except that the students, of course, \nhave no difficulty using the money. In normal life, we have to distinguish between the \npenny and other coins, not among several versions of one denomination. Although \nthis is an old study using American coins, the results still hold true today using coins \nof any currency. (From Nickerson & Adams, 1979, Cognitive Psychology, 11 (3). Reproduced with \npermission of Academic Press via Copyright Clearance Center.)\n\n\n76 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\n2.  Great precision is not required. Precision, accuracy, and complete-\nness of knowledge are seldom required. Perfect behavior results if \nthe combined knowledge in the head and in the world is sufficient to \ndistinguish an appropriate choice from all others.\n3.  Natural constraints exist in the world. The world has many nat-\nural, physical constraints that restrict the possible behavior: such \nthings as the order in which parts can go together and the ways \nby which an object can be moved, picked up, or otherwise manip-\nulated. This is knowledge in the world. Each object has physical \nfeatures—projections, depressions, screw threads, appendages—\nthat limit its relationships with other objects, the operations that \ncan be performed on it, what can be attached to it, and so on.\n4.  Knowledge of cultural constraints and conventions exists in the \nhead. Cultural constraints and conventions are learned artificial re-\nstrictions on behavior that reduce the set of likely actions, in many \ncases leaving only one or two possibilities. This is knowledge in the \nhead. Once learned, these constraints apply to a wide variety of cir-\ncumstances.\nBecause behavior can be guided by the combination of internal \nand external knowledge and constraints, people can minimize the \namount of material they must learn, as well as the completeness, \nprecision, accuracy, or depth of the learning. They also can delib-\nerately organize the environment to support behavior. This is how \nnonreaders can hide their inability, even in situations where their \njob requires reading skills. People with hearing deficits (or with \nnormal hearing but in noisy environments) learn to use other cues. \nMany of us manage quite well when in novel, confusing situations \nwhere we do not know what is expected of us. How do we do this? \nWe arrange things so that we do not need to have complete knowl-\nedge or we rely upon the knowledge of the people around us, \ncopying their behavior or getting them to do the required actions. \nIt is actually quite amazing how often it is possible to hide one’s \nignorance, to get by without understanding or even much interest.\nAlthough it is best when people have considerable knowledge and \nexperience using a particular product—knowledge in the head—\n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n77\nthe designer can put sufficient cues into the design—knowledge \nin the world—that good performance results even in the absence \nof previous knowledge. Combine the two, knowledge in the head \nand in the world, and performance is even better. How can the \ndesigner put knowledge into the device itself?\nChapters 1 and 2 introduced a wide range of fundamental design \nprinciples derived from research on human cognition and emotion. \nThis chapter shows how knowledge in the world combines with \nknowledge in the head. Knowledge in the head is knowledge in \nthe human memory system, so this chapter contains a brief review \nof the critical aspects of memory necessary for the design of usable \nproducts. I emphasize that for practical purposes, we do not need \nto know the details of scientific theories but simpler, more general, \nuseful approximations. Simplified models are the key to successful \napplication. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how natu-\nral mappings present information in the world in a manner readily \ninterpreted and usable.\nKNOWLEDGE IS IN THE WORLD\nWhenever knowledge needed to do a task is readily available in \nthe world, the need for us to learn it diminishes. For example, we \nlack knowledge about common coins, even though we recognize \nthem just fine (Figure 3.1). In knowing what our currency looks \nlike, we don’t need to know all the details, simply sufficient knowl-\nedge to distinguish one value of currency from another. Only a \nsmall minority of people must know enough to distinguish coun-\nterfeit from legitimate money.\nOr consider typing. Many typists have not memorized the key-\nboard. Usually each key is labeled, so nontypists can hunt and peck \nletter by letter, relying on knowledge in the world and minimizing \nthe time required for learning. The problem is that such typing is \nslow and difficult. With experience, of course, hunt-and-peckers \nlearn the positions of many of the letters on the keyboard, even \nwithout instruction, and typing speed increases notably, quickly \nsurpassing handwriting speeds and, for some, reaching quite re-\nspectable rates. Peripheral vision and the feel of the keyboard \n\n\n78 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nprovide some knowledge about key locations. Frequently used \nkeys become completely learned, infrequently used keys are not \nlearned well, and the other keys are partially learned. But as long \nas a typist needs to watch the keyboard, the speed is limited. The \nknowledge is still mostly in the world, not in the head.\nIf a person needs to type large amounts of material regularly, fur-\nther investment is worthwhile: a course, a book, or an interactive \nprogram. The important thing is to learn the proper placement of \nfingers on the keyboard, to learn to type without looking, to get \nknowledge about the keyboard from the world into the head. It \ntakes a few weeks to learn the system and several months of prac-\ntice to become expert. But the payoff for all this effort is increased \ntyping speed, increased accuracy, and decreased mental load and \neffort at the time of typing.\nWe only need to remember sufficient knowledge to let us get our \ntasks done. Because so much knowledge is available in the envi-\nronment, it is surprising how little we need to learn. This is one \nreason people can function well in their environment and still be \nunable to describe what they do.\nPeople function through their use of two kinds of knowledge: \nknowledge of and knowledge how. Knowledge of—what psychol-\nogists call declarative knowledge—includes the knowledge of facts \nand rules. “Stop at red traffic lights.” “New York City is north of \nRome.” “China has twice as many people as India.” “To get the \nkey out of the ignition of a Saab car, the gearshift must be in re-\nverse.” Declarative knowledge is easy to write and to teach. Note \nthat knowledge of the rules does not mean they are followed. The \ndrivers in many cities are often quite knowledgeable about the of-\nficial driving regulations, but they do not necessarily obey them. \nMoreover, the knowledge does not have to be true. New York City \nis actually south of Rome. China has only slightly more people \nthan India (roughly 10 percent). People may know many things: \nthat doesn’t mean they are true.\nKnowledge how—what psychologists call procedural knowledge—\nis the knowledge that enables a person to be a skilled musician, \nto return a serve in tennis, or to move the tongue properly when \n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n79\nsaying the phrase “frightening witches.” Procedural knowledge is \ndifficult or impossible to write down and difficult to teach. It is \nbest taught by demonstration and best learned through practice. \nEven the best teachers cannot usually describe what they are do-\ning. Procedural knowledge is largely subconscious, residing at the \nbehavioral level of processing.\nKnowledge in the world is usually easy to come by. Signifiers, \nphysical constraints, and natural mappings are all perceivable cues \nthat act as knowledge in the world. This type of knowledge occurs \nso commonly that we take it for granted. It is everywhere: the lo-\ncations of letters on a keyboard; the lights and labels on controls \nthat remind us of their purpose and give information about the \ncurrent state of the device. Industrial equipment is replete with \nsignal lights, indicators, and other reminders. We make extensive \nuse of written notes. We place items in specific locations as remind-\ners. In general, people structure their environment to provide a \nconsiderable amount of the knowledge required for something to \nbe remembered.\nMany organize their lives spatially in the world, creating a pile \nhere, a pile there, each indicating some activity to be done, some \nevent in progress. Probably everybody uses such a strategy to \nsome extent. Look around you at the variety of ways people ar-\nrange their rooms and desks. Many styles of organization are pos-\nsible, but invariably the physical layout and visibility of the items \nconvey information about relative importance.\nWHEN PRECISION IS UNEXPECTEDLY REQUIRED\nNormally, people do not need precision in their judgments. All that \nis needed is the combination of knowledge in the world and in the \nhead that makes decisions unambiguous. Everything works just \nfine unless the environment changes so that the combined knowl-\nedge is no longer sufficient: this can lead to havoc. At least three \ncountries discovered this fact the hard way: the United States, \nwhen it introduced the Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin; Great \nBritain, a one-pound coin (before the switch to decimal currency); \nand France, a ten-franc coin (before the conversion to the common \n\n\n80 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nEuropean currency, the euro). The US dollar coin was confused \nwith the existing twenty-five-cent piece (the quarter), and the Brit-\nish pound coin with the then five-pence piece that had the same \ndiameter. Here is what happened in France:\nPARIS With a good deal of fanfare, the French government released the \nnew 10-franc coin (worth a little more than $1.50) on Oct. 22 [1986]. \nThe public looked at it, weighed it, and began confusing it so quickly \nwith the half-franc coin (worth only 8 cents) that a crescendo of fury \nand ridicule fell on both the government and the coin.\nFive weeks later, Minister of Finance Edouard Balladur suspended \ncirculation of the coin. Within another four weeks, he canceled it \naltogether.\nIn retrospect, the French decision seems so foolish that it is hard to \nfathom how it could have been made. After much study, designers came \nup with a silver-colored coin made of nickel and featuring a modernistic \ndrawing by artist Joaquim Jimenez of a Gallic rooster on one side and \nof Marianne, the female symbol of the French republic, on the other. \nThe coin was light, sported special ridges on its rim for easy reading by \nelectronic vending machines and seemed tough to counterfeit.\nBut the designers and bureaucrats were obviously so excited by their \ncreation that they ignored or refused to accept the new coin’s similar-\nity to the hundreds of millions of silver-colored, nickel-based half-franc \ncoins in circulation [whose] size and weight were perilously simi-\nlar. (Stanley Meisler. Copyright © 1986, Los Angeles Times. Reprinted with \npermission.)\nThe confusions probably occurred because the users of coins had \nalready formed representations in their memories that were only \nsufficiently precise to distinguish among the coins that they were \naccustomed to using. Psychological research suggests that people \nmaintain only partial descriptions of the things to be remembered. \nIn the three examples of new coins introduced in the United States, \nGreat Britain, and France, the descriptions formed to distinguish \namong national currency were not precise enough to distinguish be-\ntween a new coin and at least one of the old coins.\n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n81\nSuppose I keep all my notes in a small red notebook. If this is \nmy only notebook, I can describe it simply as “my notebook.” If I \nbuy several more notebooks, the earlier description will no longer \nwork. Now I must identify the first one as small or red, or maybe both \nsmall and red, whichever allows me to distinguish it from the oth-\ners. But what if I acquire several small red notebooks? Now I must \nfind some other means of describing the first book, adding to the \nrichness of the description and to its ability to discriminate among \nthe several similar items. Descriptions need discriminate only \namong the choices in front of me, but what works for one purpose \nmay not for another.\nNot all similar-looking items cause confusion. In updating this \nedition of the book, I searched to see whether there might be more \nrecent examples of coin confusions. I found this interesting item on \nthe website Wikicoins.com:\nSomeday, a leading psychologist may weigh in on one of the perplexing \nquestions of our time: if the American public was constantly confusing \nthe Susan B. Anthony dollar with the roughly similar-sized quarter, how \ncome they weren’t also constantly confusing the $20 bill with the identi-\ncal-sized $1 bill? (James A. Capp, “Susan B. Anthony Dollar,” at www.wiki\ncoins.com. Retrieved May 29, 2012)\nHere is the answer. Why not any confusion? We learn to dis-\ncriminate among things by looking for distinguishing features. In \nthe United States, size is one major way of distinguishing among \ncoins, but not among paper money. With paper money, all the bills \nare the same size, so Americans ignore size and look at the printed \nnumbers and images. Hence, we often confuse similar-size Amer-\nican coins but only seldom confuse similar-size American bills. \nBut people who come from a country that uses size and color of \ntheir paper money to distinguish among the amounts (for exam-\nple, Great Britain or any country that uses the euro) have learned \nto use size and color to distinguish among paper money and \ntherefore are invariably confused when dealing with bills from \nthe United States.\n",

This is because the long-\nterm residents were working with their original set of descriptions, \nwhich did not easily accommodate the distinctions between these \ntwo coins. Newcomers, however, started off with no preconcep-\ntions and therefore formed a set of descriptions to distinguish \namong all the coins; in this situation, the one-pound coin offered \nno particular problem. In the United States, the Susan B. Anthony \ndollar coin never became popular and is no longer being made, so \nthe equivalent observations cannot be made.\nWhat gets confused depends heavily upon history: the aspects \nthat have allowed us to distinguish among the objects in the past. \nWhen the rules for discrimination change, people can become con-\nfused and make errors. With time, they will adjust and learn to \ndiscriminate just fine and may even forget the initial period of con-\nfusion. The problem is that in many circumstances, especially one \nas politically charged as the size, shape, and color of currency, the \npublic’s outrage prevents calm discussion and does not allow for \nany adjustment time.\nConsider this as an example of design principles interacting with \nthe messy practicality of the real world. What appears good in prin-\nciple can sometimes fail when introduced to the world. Sometimes, \nbad products succeed and good products fail. The world is complex.\nCONSTRAINTS SIMPLIFY MEMORY\nBefore widespread literacy, and especially before the advent of \nsound recording devices, performers traveled from village to vil-\nlage, reciting epic poems thousands of lines long. This tradition \nstill exists in some societies. How do people memorize such volu-\nminous amounts of material? Do some people have huge amounts \nof knowledge in their heads? Not really. It turns out that external \nconstraints exert control over the permissible choice of words, thus \ndramatically reducing the memory load. One of the secrets comes \nfrom the powerful constraints of poetry.\n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n83\nConsider the constraints of rhyming. If you wish to rhyme one \nword with another, there are usually a lot of alternatives. But if \nyou must have a word with a particular meaning to rhyme with \nanother, the joint constraints of meaning and rhyme can cause a \ndramatic reduction in the number of possible candidates, some-\ntimes reducing a large set to a single choice. Sometimes there are \nno candidates at all. This is why it is much easier to memorize \npoetry than to create poems. Poems come in many different forms, \nbut all have formal restrictions on their construction. The ballads \nand tales told by the traveling storytellers used multiple poetic \nconstraints, including rhyme, rhythm, meter, assonance, allitera-\ntion, and onomatopoeia, while also remaining consistent with the \nstory being told.\nConsider these two examples:\nOne. I am thinking of three words: one means “a mythical being,” \nthe second is “the name of a building material,” and the third is “a unit \nof time.” What words do I have in mind?\nTwo. This time look for rhyming words. I am thinking of three \nwords: one rhymes with “post,” the second with “eel,” and the third \nwith “ear.” What words am I thinking of? (From Rubin & Wallace, 1989.)\nIn both examples, even though you might have found answers, they \nwere not likely to be the same three that I had in mind. There sim-\nply are not enough constraints. But suppose I now tell you that the \nwords I seek are the same in both tasks: What is a word that means \na mythical being and rhymes with “post”? What word is the name \nof a building material and rhymes with “eel”? And what word is a \nunit of time and rhymes with “ear”? Now the task is easy: the joint \nspecification of the words completely constrains the selection. When \nthe psychologists David Rubin and Wanda Wallace studied these \nexamples in their laboratory, people almost never got the correct \nmeanings or rhymes for the first two tasks, but most people correctly \nanswered, “ghost,” “steel,” and “year” in the combined task.\nThe classic study of memory for epic poetry was done by Albert \nBates Lord. In the mid-1900s he traveled throughout the former \n\n\n84 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nYugoslavia (now a number of separate, independent countries) \nand found people who still followed the oral tradition. He demon-\nstrated that the “singer of tales,” the person who learns epic poems \nand goes from village to village reciting them, is really re-creating \nthem, composing poetry on the fly in such a way that it obeys the \nrhythm, theme, story line, structure, and other characteristics of \nthe poem. This is a prodigious feat, but it is not an example of rote \nmemory.\nThe power of multiple constraints allows one singer to listen to \nanother singer tell a lengthy tale once, and then after a delay of \na few hours or a day, to recite “the same song, word for word, \nand line for line.” In fact, as Lord points out, the original and new \nrecitations are not the same word for word, but both teller and \nlistener perceive them as the same, even when the second version \nwas twice as long as the first. They are the same in the ways that \nmatter to the listener: they tell the same story, express the same \nideas, and follow the same rhyme and meter. They are the same in \nall senses that matter to the culture. Lord shows just how the com-\nbination of memory for poetics, theme, and style combines with \ncultural structures into what he calls a “formula” for producing a \npoem perceived as identical to earlier recitations.\nThe notion that someone should be able to recite word for word \nis relatively modern. Such a notion can be held only after printed \ntexts become available; otherwise who could judge the accuracy of \na recitation? Perhaps more important, who would care?\nAll this is not to detract from the feat. Learning and reciting an \nepic poem, such as Homer’s Odyssey and Iliad, is clearly difficult \neven if the singer is re-creating it: there are twenty-seven thousand \nlines of verse in the combined written version. Lord points out that \nthis length is excessive, probably produced only during the spe-\ncial circumstances in which Homer (or some other singer) dictated \nthe story slowly and repetitively to the person who first wrote it \ndown. Normally the length would be varied to accommodate the \nwhims of the audience, and no normal audience could sit through \ntwenty-seven thousand lines. But even at one-third the size, nine \nthousand lines, being able to recite the poem is impressive: at one \n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n85\nsecond per line, the verses would take two and one-half hours to \nrecite. It is impressive even allowing for the fact that the poem is \nre-created as opposed to memorized, because neither the singer \nnor the audience expect word-for-word accuracy (nor would either \nhave any way of verifying that).\nMost of us do not learn epic poems. But we do make use of strong \nconstraints that serve to simplify what must be retained in memory. \nConsider an example from a completely different domain: taking \napart and reassembling a mechanical device. Typical items in the \nhome that an adventuresome person might attempt to repair in-\nclude a door lock, toaster, and washing machine. The device is apt \nto have tens of parts. What has to be remembered to be able to put \nthe parts together again in a proper order? Not as much as might \nappear from an initial analysis. In the extreme case, if there are ten \nparts, there are 10! (ten factorial) different ways in which to reas-\nsemble them—a little over 3.5 million alternatives.\nBut few of these possibilities are possible: there are numerous \nphysical constraints on the ordering. Some pieces must be assem-\nbled before it is even possible to assemble the others. Some pieces \nare physically constrained from fitting into the spots reserved for \nothers: bolts must fit into holes of an appropriate diameter and \ndepth; nuts and washers must be paired with bolts and screws \nof appropriate sizes; and washers must always be put on before \nnuts. There are even cultural constraints: we turn screws clock-\nwise to tighten, counterclockwise to loosen; the heads of screws \ntend to go on the visible part (front or top) of a piece, bolts on the \nless visible part (bottom, side, or interior); wood screws and ma-\nchine screws look different and are inserted into different kinds \nof materials. In the end, the apparently large number of decisions \nis reduced to only a few choices that should have been learned \nor otherwise noted during the disassembly. The constraints by \nthemselves are often not sufficient to determine the proper reas-\nsembly of the device—mistakes do get made—but the constraints \nreduce the amount that must be learned to a reasonable quantity. \nConstraints are powerful tools for the designer: they are exam-\nined in detail in Chapter 4.\n\n\n86 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nMemory Is Knowledge in the Head\nAn old Arabic folk tale, “‘Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” tells \nhow the poor woodcutter ‘Ali Baba discovered the secret cave of a \nband of thieves. ‘Ali Baba overheard the thieves entering the cave \nand learned the secret phrase that opened the cave: “Open Sim-\nsim.” (Simsim means “sesame” in Persian, so many versions of the \nstory translate the phrase as “Open Sesame.”) ‘Ali Baba’s brother-\nin-law, Kasim, forced him to reveal the secret. Kasim then went to \nthe cave.\nWhen he reached the entrance of the cavern, he pronounced the words, \nOpen Simsim!\nThe door immediately opened, and when he was in, closed on him. In \nexamining the cave he was greatly astonished to find much more riches \nthan he had expected from ‘Ali Baba’s relation.\nHe quickly laid at the door of the cavern as many bags of gold as his \nten mules could carry, but his thoughts were now so full of the great \nriches he should possess, that he could not think of the necessary words \nto make the door open. Instead of Open Simsim! he said Open Barley! \nand was much amazed to find that the door remained shut. He named \nseveral sorts of grain, but still the door would not open.\nKasim never expected such an incident, and was so alarmed at the \ndanger he was in that the more he endeavoured to remember the word \nSimsim the more his memory was confounded, and he had as much \nforgotten it as if he had never heard it mentioned.\nKasim never got out. The thieves returned, cut off Kasim’s head, and \nquartered his body. (From Colum’s 1953 edition of The Arabian Nights.)\nMost of us will not get our head cut off if we fail to remember a \nsecret code, but it can still be very hard to recall the code. It is one \nthing to have to memorize one or two secrets: a combination, or \na password, or the secret to opening a door. But when the num-\nber of secret codes gets too large, memory fails. There seems to \nbe a conspiracy, one calculated to destroy our sanity by overload-\ning our memory. Many codes, such as postal codes and telephone \nnumbers, exist primarily to make life easier for machines and their \n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n87\ndesigners without any consideration of the burden placed upon \npeople. Fortunately, technology has now permitted most of us \nto avoid having to remember this arbitrary knowledge but to let \nour technology do it for us: phone numbers, addresses and postal \ncodes, Internet and e-mail addresses are all retrievable automati-\ncally, so we no longer have to learn them. Security codes, however, \nare a different matter, and in the never-ending, escalating battle \nbetween the white hats and the black, the good guys and the bad, \nthe number of different arbitrary codes we must remember or spe-\ncial security devices we must carry with us continues to escalate in \nboth number and complexity.\nMany of these codes must be kept secret. There is no way that \nwe can learn all those numbers or phrases. Quick: what magical \ncommand was Kasim trying to remember to open the cavern door?\nHow do most people cope? They use simple passwords. Studies \nshow that five of the most common passwords are: “password,” \n“123456,” “12345678,” “qwerty,” and “abc123.” All of these are \nclearly selected for easy remembering and typing. All are therefore \neasy for a thief or mischief-maker to try. Most people (including \nme) have a small number of passwords that they use on as many \ndifferent sites as possible. Even security professionals admit to this, \nthereby hypocritically violating their own rules.\nMany of the security requirements are unnecessary, and need-\nlessly complex. So why are they required? There are many rea-\nsons. One is that there are real problems: criminals impersonate \nidentities to steal people’s money and possessions. People invade \nothers’ privacy, for nefarious or even harmless purposes. Profes-\nsors and teachers need to safeguard examination questions and \ngrades. For companies and nations, it is important to maintain se-\ncrets. There are lots of reasons to keep things behind locked doors \nor password-protected walls. The problem, however, is the lack of \nproper understanding of human abilities.\nWe do need protection, but most of the people who enforce \nthe security requirements at schools, businesses, and govern-\nment are technologists or possibly law-enforcement officials. \nThey understand crime, but not human behavior. They believe \n\n\n88 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nthat “strong” passwords, ones difficult to guess, are required, \nand that they must be changed frequently. They do not seem \nto recognize that we now need so many passwords—even easy \nones—that it is difficult to remember which goes with which re-\nquirement. This creates a new layer of vulnerability.\nThe more complex the password requirements, the less secure \nthe system. Why? Because people, unable to remember all these \ncombinations, write them down. And then where do they store this \nprivate, valuable knowledge? In their wallet, or taped under the \ncomputer keyboard, or wherever it is easy to find, because it is so \nfrequently needed. So a thief only has to steal the wallet or find the \nlist and then all secrets are known. Most people are honest, con-\ncerned workers. And it is these individuals that complex security \nsystems impede the most, preventing them from getting their work \ndone. As a result, it is often the most dedicated employee who vio-\nlates the security rules and weakens the overall system.\nWhen I was doing the research for this chapter, I found numer-\nous examples of secure passwords that force people to use insecure \nmemory devices for them. One post on the “Mail Online” forum of \nthe British Daily Mail newspaper described the technique:\nWhen I used to work for the local government organisation we HAD \nTO change our Passwords every three months. To ensure I could \nremember it, I used to write it on a Post-It note and stick it above \nmy desk.\nHow can we remember all these secret things? Most of us can’t, \neven with the use of mnemonics to make some sense of nonsensi-\ncal material. Books and courses on improving memory can work, \nbut the methods are laborious to learn and need continual practice \nto maintain. So we put the memory in the world, writing things \ndown in books, on scraps of paper, even on the backs of our hands. \nBut we disguise them to thwart would-be thieves. That creates an-\nother problem: How do we disguise the items, how do we hide \nthem, and how do we remember what the disguise was or where \nwe put it? Ah, the foibles of memory.\n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n89\nWhere should you hide something so that nobody else will find \nit? In unlikely places, right? Money is hidden in the freezer; jew-\nelry in the medicine cabinet or in shoes in the closet. The key to \nthe front door is hidden under the mat or just below the window \nledge. The car key is under the bumper. The love letters are in a \nflower vase. The problem is, there aren’t that many unlikely places \nin the home. You may not remember where the love letters or keys \nare hidden, but your burglar will. Two psychologists who exam-\nined the issue described the problem this way:\nThere is often a logic involved in the choice of unlikely places. For exam-\nple, a friend of ours was required by her insurance company to acquire \na safe if she wished to insure her valuable gems. Recognizing that she \nmight forget the combination to the safe, she thought carefully about \nwhere to keep the combination. Her solution was to write it in her per-\nsonal phone directory under the letter S next to “Mr. and Mrs. Safe,” as \nif it were a telephone number. There is a clear logic here: Store numer-\nical information with other numerical information. She was appalled, \nhowever, when she heard a reformed burglar on a daytime television \ntalk show say that upon encountering a safe, he always headed for the \nphone directory because many people keep the combination there. (From \nWinograd & Soloway, 1986, “On Forgetting the Locations of Things Stored in \nSpecial Places.” Reprinted with permission.)\nAll the arbitrary things we need to remember add up to unwit-\nting tyranny. It is time for a revolt. But before we revolt, it is impor-\ntant to know the solution. As noted earlier, one of my self-imposed \nrules is, “Never criticize unless you have a better alternative.” In \nthis case, it is not clear what the better system might be.\nSome things can only be solved by massive cultural changes, \nwhich probably means they will never be solved. For example, \ntake the problem of identifying people by their names. People’s \nnames evolved over many thousands of years, originally simply \nto distinguish people within families and groups who lived to-\ngether. The use of multiple names (given names and surnames) \nis relatively recent, and even those do not distinguish one person \n\n\n90 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nfrom all the seven billion in the world. Do we write the given name \nfirst, or the surname? It depends upon what country you are in. \nHow many names does a person have? How many characters in \na name? What characters are legitimate? For example, can a name \ninclude a digit? (I know people who have tried to use such names \nas “h3nry.” I know of a company named “Autonom3.”)\nHow does a name translate from one alphabet to another? Some \nof my Korean friends have given names that are identical when \nwritten in the Korean alphabet, Hangul, but that are different \nwhen transliterated into English.\nMany people change their names when they get married or \ndivorced, and in some cultures, when they pass significant life \nevents. A quick search on the Internet reveals multiple questions \nfrom people in Asia who are confused about how to fill out Amer-\nican or European passport forms because their names don’t corre-\nspond to the requirements.\nAnd what happens when a thief steals a person’s identity, mas-\nquerading as the other individual, using his or her money and \ncredit? In the United States, these identity thieves can also apply \nfor income tax rebates and get them, and when the legitimate tax-\npayers try to get their legitimate refund, they are told they already \nreceived it.\nI once attended a meeting of security experts that was held at \nthe corporate campus of Google. Google, like most corporations, \nis very protective of its processes and advanced research projects, \nso most of the buildings were locked and guarded. Attendees of \nthe security meeting were not allowed access (except those who \nworked at Google, of course). Our meetings were held in a con-\nference room in the public space of an otherwise secure building. \nBut the toilets were all located inside a secure area. How did we \nmanage? These world-famous, leading authorities on security fig-\nured out a solution: They found a brick and used it to prop open \nthe door leading into the secure area. So much for security: Make \nsomething too secure, and it becomes less secure.\nHow do we solve these problems? How do we guarantee peo-\nple’s access to their own records, bank accounts, and computer \n",

Biometric markers \n(iris or retina patterns, fingerprints, voice recognition, body type, \nDNA)? All can be forged or the systems’ databases manipulated. \nOnce someone manages to fool the system, what recourse is there? \nIt isn’t possible to change biometric markers, so once they point to \nthe wrong person, changes are extremely difficult to make.\nThe strength of a password is actually pretty irrelevant because \nmost passwords are obtained through “key loggers” or are stolen. \nA key logger is software hidden within your computer system that \nrecords what you type and sends it to the bad guys. When computer \nsystems are broken into, millions of passwords might get stolen, and \neven if they are encrypted, the bad guys can often decrypt them. In \nboth these cases, however secure the password, the bad guys know \nwhat it is.\nThe safest methods require multiple identifiers, the most com-\nmon schemes requiring at least two different kinds: “something \nyou have” plus “something you know.” The “something you have” \nis often a physical identifier, such as a card or key, perhaps even \nsomething implanted under the skin or a biometric identifier, such \nas fingerprints or patterns of the eye’s iris. The “something you \nknow” would be knowledge in the head, most likely something \nmemorized. The memorized item doesn’t have to be as secure as to-\nday’s passwords because it wouldn’t work without the “something \nyou have.” Some systems allow for a second, alerting password, so \nthat if the bad guys try to force someone to enter a password into \na system, the individual would use the alerting one, which would \nwarn the authorities of an illegal entry.\nSecurity poses major design issues, ones that involve complex \ntechnology as well as human behavior. There are deep, fundamental \ndifficulties. Is there a solution? No, not yet. We will probably be stuck \nwith these complexities for a long time.\nThe Structure of Memory\nSay aloud the numbers 1, 7, 4, 2, 8. Next, without looking back, repeat \nthem. Try again if you must, perhaps closing your eyes, the better \n\n\n92 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nto “hear” the sound still echoing in mental activity. Have someone \nread a random sentence to you. What were the words? The memory of \nthe just present is available immediately, clear and complete, without \nmental effort.\nWhat did you eat for dinner three days ago? Now the feeling is dif-\nferent. It takes time to recover the answer, which is neither as clear nor \nas complete a remembrance as that of the just present, and the recovery \nis likely to require considerable mental effort. Retrieval of the past dif-\nfers from retrieval of the just present. More effort is required, less clarity \nresults. Indeed, the “past” need not be so long ago. Without looking \nback, what were those digits? For some people, this retrieval now takes \ntime and effort. (From Learning and Memory, Norman, 1982.)\nPsychologists distinguish between two major classes of memory: \nshort-term or working memory, and long-term memory. The two \nare quite different, with different implications for design.\nSHORT-TERM OR WORKING MEMORY\nShort-term or working memory (STM) retains the most recent ex-\nperiences or material that is currently being thought about. It is the \nmemory of the just present. Information is retained automatically \nand retrieved without effort; but the amount of information that \ncan be retained this way is severely limited. Something like five to \nseven items is the limit of STM, with the number going to ten or \ntwelve if the material is continually repeated, what psychologists \ncall “rehearsing.”\nMultiply 27 times 293 in your head. If you try to do it the same \nway you would with paper and pencil, you will almost definitely \nbe unable to hold all the digits and intervening answers within \nSTM. You will fail. The traditional method of multiplying is opti-\nmized for paper and pencil. There is no need to minimize the bur-\nden on working memory because the numbers written on the paper \nserve this function (knowledge in the world), so the burden on \nSTM, on knowledge in the head, is quite limited. There are ways \nof doing mental multiplication, but the methods are quite different \n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n93\nfrom those using paper and pencil and require considerable train-\ning and practice.\nShort-term memory is invaluable in the performance of everyday \ntasks, in letting us remember words, names, phrases, and parts \nof tasks: hence its alternative name, working memory. But the ma-\nterial being maintained in STM is quite fragile. Get distracted by \nsome other activity and, poof, the stuff in STM disappears. It is ca-\npable of holding a postal code or telephone number from the time \nyou look it up until the time it is used—as long as no distractions \noccur. Nine- or ten-digit numbers give trouble, and when the num-\nber starts to exceed that—don’t bother. Write it down. Or divide \nthe number into several shorter segments, transforming the long \nnumber into meaningful chunks.\nMemory experts use special techniques, called mnemonics, to \nremember amazingly large amounts of material, often after only \na single exposure. One method is to transform the digits into \nmeaningful segments (one famous study showed how an athlete \nthought of digit sequences as running times, and after refining \nthe method over a long period, could learn incredibly long se-\nquences at one glance). One traditional method used to encode \nlong sequences of digits is to first transform each digit into a \nconsonant, then transform the consonant sequence into a memo-\nrable phrase. A standard table of conversions of digits to conso-\nnants has been around for hundreds of years, cleverly designed \nto be easy to learn because the consonants can be derived from \nthe shape of the digits. Thus, “1” is translated into “t” (or the \nsimilar-sounding “d”), “2” becomes “n,” “3” becomes “m,” “4” is \n“r,” and “5” becomes “L” (as in the Roman numeral for 50). The \nfull table and the mnemonics for learning the pairings are read-\nily found on the Internet by searching for “number-consonant \nmnemonic.”\nUsing the number-consonant transformation, the string \n4194780135092770 translates into the letters rtbrkfstmlspncks, \nwhich in turn may become, “A hearty breakfast meal has pan-\ncakes.” Most people are not experts at retaining long arbitrary \n\n\n94 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nstrings of anything, so although it is interesting to observe memory \nwizards, it would be wrong to design systems that assumed this \nlevel of proficiency.\nThe capacity of STM is surprisingly difficult to measure, because \nhow much can be retained depends upon the familiarity of the \nmaterial. Retention, moreover, seems to be of meaningful items, \nrather than of some simpler measure such as seconds or individual \nsounds or letters. Retention is affected by both time and the num-\nber of items. The number of items is more important than time, \nwith each new item decreasing the likelihood of remembering all \nof the preceding items. The capacity is items because people can \nremember roughly the same number of digits and words, and al-\nmost the same number of simple three- to five-word phrases. How \ncan this be? I suspect that STM holds something akin to a pointer \nto an already encoded item in long-term memory, which means \nthe memory capacity is the number of pointers it can keep. This \nwould account for the fact that the length or complexity of the item \nhas little impact—simply the number of items. It doesn’t neatly \naccount for the fact that we make acoustical errors in STM, unless \nthe pointers are held in a kind of acoustical memory. This remains \nan open topic for scientific exploration.\nThe traditional measures of STM capacity range from five to \nseven, but from a practical point of view, it is best to think of it as \nholding only three to five items. Does that seem too small a num-\nber? Well, when you meet a new person, do you always remember \nhis or her name? When you have to dial a phone number, do you \nhave to look at it several times while entering the digits? Even mi-\nnor distractions can wipe out the stuff we are trying to hold on to \nin STM.\nWhat are the design implications? Don’t count on much being \nretained in STM. Computer systems often enhance people’s frus-\ntration when things go wrong by presenting critical information \nin a message that then disappears from the display just when the \nperson wishes to make use of the information. So how can people \nremember the critical information? I am not surprised when peo-\nple hit, kick, or otherwise attack their computers.\n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n95\nI have seen nurses write down critical medical information \nabout their patients on their hands because the critical informa-\ntion would disappear if the nurse was distracted for a moment by \nsomeone asking a question. The electronic medical records systems \nautomatically log out users when the system does not appear to \nbe in use. Why the automatic logouts? To protect patient privacy. \nThe cause may be well motivated, but the action poses severe chal-\nlenges to nurses who are continually being interrupted in their \nwork by physicians, co-workers, or patient requests. While they \nare attending to the interruption, the system logs them out, so \nthey have to start over again. No wonder these nurses wrote down \nthe knowledge, although this then negated much of the value of \nthe computer system in minimizing handwriting errors. But what \nelse were they to do? How else to get at the critical information? \nThey couldn’t remember it all: that’s why they had computers.\nThe limits on our short-term memory systems caused by inter-\nfering tasks can be mitigated by several techniques. One is through \nthe use of multiple sensory modalities. Visual information does \nnot much interfere with auditory, actions do not interfere much \nwith either auditory or written material. Haptics (touch) is also \nminimally interfering. To maximize efficiency of working memory \nit is best to present different information over different modali-\nties: sight, sound, touch (haptics), hearing, spatial location, and \ngestures. Automobiles should use auditory presentation of driv-\ning instructions and haptic vibration of the appropriate side of the \ndriver’s seat or steering wheel to warn when drivers leave their \nlanes, or when there are other vehicles to the left or right, so as \nnot to interfere with the visual processing of driving information. \nDriving is primarily visual, so the use of auditory and haptic mo-\ndalities minimizes interference with the visual task.\nLONG-TERM MEMORY\nLong-term memory (LTM) is memory for the past. As a rule, it \ntakes time for information to get into LTM and time and effort to \nget it out again. Sleep seems to play an important role in strength-\nening the memories of each day’s experiences. Note that we do \n\n\n96 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nnot remember our experiences as an exact recording; rather, as \nbits and pieces that are reconstructed and interpreted each time \nwe recover the memories, which means they are subject to all the \ndistortions and changes that the human explanatory mechanism \nimposes upon life. How well we can ever recover experiences and \nknowledge from LTM is highly dependent upon how the material \nwas interpreted in the first place. What is stored in LTM under one \ninterpretation probably cannot be found later on when sought un-\nder some other interpretation. As for how large the memory is, no-\nbody really knows: giga- or tera-items. We don’t even know what \nkinds of units should be used. Whatever the size, it is so large as \nnot to impose any practical limit.\nThe role of sleep in the strengthening of LTM is still not well un-\nderstood, but there are numerous papers investigating the topic. \nOne possible mechanism is that of rehearsal. It has long been \nknown that rehearsal of material—mentally reviewing it while still \nactive in working memory (STM)—is an important component of \nthe formation of long-term memory traces. “Whatever makes you \nrehearse during sleep is going to determine what you remember \nlater, and conversely, what you’re going to forget,” said Professor \nKen Paller of Northwestern University, one of the authors of a re-\ncent study on the topic (Oudiette, Antony, Creery, and Paller, 2013). \nBut although rehearsal in sleep strengthens memories, it might \nalso falsify them: “Memories in our brain are changing all of the \ntime. Sometimes you improve memory storage by rehearsing all \nthe details, so maybe later you remember better—or maybe worse \nif you’ve embellished too much.”\nRemember how you answered this question from Chapter 2?\nIn the house you lived in three houses ago, as you entered the front door, \nwas the doorknob on the left or right?\nFor most people, the question requires considerable effort just to \nrecall which house is involved, plus one of the special techniques \ndescribed in Chapter 2 for putting yourself back at the scene and \nreconstructing the answer. This is an example of procedural mem-\n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n97\nory, a memory for how we do things, as opposed to declarative \nmemory, the memory for factual information. In both cases, it can \ntake considerable time and effort to get to the answer. Moreover, \nthe answer is not directly retrieved in a manner analogous to the \nway we read answers from books or websites. The answer is a re-\nconstruction of the knowledge, so it is subject to biases and dis-\ntortions. Knowledge in memory is meaningful, and at the time of \nretrieval, a person might subject it to a different meaningful inter-\npretation than is wholly accurate.\nA major difficulty with LTM is in organization. How do we find \nthe things we are trying to remember? Most people have had the \n“tip of the tongue” experience when trying to remember a name \nor word: there is a feeling of knowing, but the knowledge is not \nconsciously available. Sometime later, when engaged in some \nother, different activity, the name may suddenly pop into the \nconscious mind. The way by which people retrieve the needed \nknowledge is still unknown, but probably involves some form \nof pattern-matching mechanism coupled with a confirmatory pro-\ncess that checks for consistency with the required knowledge. This \nis why when you search for a name but continually retrieve the \nwrong name, you know it is wrong. Because this false retrieval im-\npedes the correct retrieval, you have to turn to some other activity \nto allow the subconscious memory retrieval process to reset itself.\nBecause retrieval is a reconstructive process, it can be erroneous. \nWe may reconstruct events the way we would prefer to remember \nthem, rather than the way we experienced them. It is relatively \neasy to bias people so that they form false memories, “remember-\ning” events in their lives with great clarity, even though they never \noccurred. This is one reason that eyewitness testimony in courts of \nlaw is so problematic: eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable. A \nhuge number of psychological experiments show how easy it is to \nimplant false memories into people’s minds so convincingly that \npeople refuse to admit that the memory is of an event that never \nhappened.\nKnowledge in the head is actually knowledge in memory: inter-\nnal knowledge. If we examine how people use their memories and \n\n\n98 \nThe Design of Everyday Things\nhow they retrieve knowledge, we discover a number of categories. \nTwo are important for us now:\n1.  Memory for arbitrary things. The items to be retained seem arbi-\ntrary, with no meaning and no particular relationship to one another \nor to things already known.\n2.  Memory for meaningful things. The items to be retained form \nmeaningful relationships with themselves or with other things al-\nready known.\nMEMORY FOR ARBITRARY AND MEANINGFUL THINGS\nArbitrary knowledge can be classified as the simple remembering \nof things that have no underlying meaning or structure. A good \nexample is the memory of the letters of the alphabet and their or-\ndering, the names of people, and foreign vocabulary, where there \nappears to be no obvious structure to the material. This also ap-\nplies to the learning of the arbitrary key sequences, commands, \ngestures, and procedures of much of our modern technology: This \nis rote learning, the bane of modern existence.\nSome things do require rote learning: the letters of the alphabet, for \nexample, but even here we add structure to the otherwise mean-\ningless list of words, turning the alphabet into a song, using the \nnatural constraints of rhyme and rhythm to create some structure.\nRote learning creates problems. First, because what is being \nlearned is arbitrary, the learning is difficult: it can take con-\nsiderable time and effort. Second, when a problem arises, the \nmemorized sequence of actions gives no hint of what has gone \nwrong, no suggestion of what might be done to fix the problem. \nAlthough some things are appropriate to learn by rote, most are \nnot. Alas, it is still the dominant method of instruction in many \nschool systems, and even for much adult training. This is how \nsome people are taught to use computers, or to cook. It is how we \nhave to learn to use some of the new (poorly designed) gadgets \nof our technology.\nWe learn arbitrary associations or sequences by artificially pro-\nviding structure.

As we saw in the discussion of these methods for \nSTM, even strings of digits can be remembered if they can be asso-\nciated with meaningful structures. People who have not received \nthis training or who have not invented some methods themselves \noften try to manufacture some artificial structure, but these are of-\nten rather unsatisfactory, which is why the learning is so bad.\nMost things in the world have a sensible structure, which tre-\nmendously simplifies the memory task. When things make sense, \nthey correspond to knowledge that we already have, so the new \nmaterial can be understood, interpreted, and integrated with pre-\nviously acquired material. Now we can use rules and constraints \nto help understand what things go together. Meaningful structure \ncan organize apparent chaos and arbitrariness.\nRemember the discussion of conceptual models in Chapter 1? \nPart of the power of a good conceptual model lies in its ability to \nprovide meaning to things. Let’s look at an example to show how \na meaningful interpretation transforms an apparently arbitrary \ntask into a natural one. Note that the appropriate interpretation \nmay not at first be obvious; it, too, is knowledge and has to be \ndiscovered.\nA Japanese colleague, Professor Yutaka Sayeki of the University \nof Tokyo, had difficulty remembering how to use the turn signal \nswitch on his motorcycle’s left handlebar. Moving the switch for-\nward signaled a right turn; backward, a left turn. The meaning of \nthe switch was clear and unambiguous, but the direction in which \nit should be moved was not. Sayeki kept thinking that because \nthe switch was on the left handlebar, pushing it forward should \nsignal a left turn. That is, he was trying to map the action “push \nthe left switch forward” to the intention “turn left,” which was \nwrong. As a result, he had trouble remembering which switch di-\nrection should be used for which turning direction. Most motor-\ncycles have the turn-signal switch mounted differently, rotated \n90 degrees, so that moving it left signals a left turn; moving it \n\n\n100 The Design of Everyday Things\nright, a right turn. This mapping is easy to learn (it is an example \nof a natural mapping, discussed at the end of this chapter). But the \nturn switch on Sayeki’s motorcycle moved forward and back, not \nleft and right. How could he learn it?\nSayeki solved the problem by reinterpreting the action. Consider \nthe way the handlebars of the motorcycle turn. For a left turn, the \nleft handlebar moves backward. For a right turn, the left handlebar \nmoves forward. The required switch movements exactly paralleled \nthe handlebar movements. If the task is conceptualized as signal-\ning the direction of motion of the handlebars rather than the direc-\ntion of the motorcycle, the switch motion can be seen to mimic the \ndesired motion; finally we have a natural mapping.\nWhen the motion of the switch seemed arbitrary, it was difficult to \nremember. Once Professor Sayeki had invented a meaningful relation-\nship, he found it easy to remember the proper switch operation. (Ex-\nperienced riders will point out that this conceptual model is wrong: to \nturn a bike, one first steers in the opposite direction of the turn. This is \ndiscussed as Example 3 in the next section, “Approximate Models.”)\nThe design implications are clear: provide meaningful struc-\ntures. Perhaps a better way is to make memory unnecessary: put \nthe required information in the world. This is the power of the \ntraditional graphical user interface with its old-fashioned menu \nstructure. When in doubt, one could always examine all the menu \nitems until the desired one was found. Even systems that do not \nuse menus need to provide some structure: appropriate constraints \nand forcing functions, natural good mapping, and all the tools of \nfeedforward and feedback. The most effective way of helping peo-\nple remember is to make it unnecessary.\nApproximate Models: Memory in the Real World\nConscious thinking takes time and mental resources. Well-learned \nskills bypass the need for conscious oversight and control: con-\nscious control is only required for initial learning and for dealing \nwith unexpected situations. Continual practice automates the \naction cycle, minimizing the amount of conscious thinking and \nproblem-solving required to act. Most expert, skilled behavior \n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n101\nworks this way, whether it is playing tennis or a musical instru-\nment, or doing mathematics and science. Experts minimize the \nneed for conscious reasoning. Philosopher and mathematician Al-\nfred North Whitehead stated this principle over a century ago:\nIt is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by \neminent people when they are making speeches, that we should culti-\nvate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is \nthe case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important \noperations which we can perform without thinking about them. (Alfred \nNorth Whitehead, 1911.)\nOne way to simplify thought is to use simplified models, ap-\nproximations to the true underlying state of affairs. Science deals \nin truth, practice deals with approximations. Practitioners don’t \nneed truth: they need results relatively quickly that, although in-\naccurate, are “good enough” for the purpose to which they will be \napplied. Consider these examples:\nEXAMPLE 1: CONVERTING TEMPERATURES \nBETWEEN FAHRENHEIT AND CELSIUS\nIt is now 55°F outside my home in California. What temperature is \nit in Celsius? Quick, do it in your head without using any technol-\nogy: What is the answer?\nI am sure all of you remember the conversion equation: \n°C = (°F–32) × 5 / 9\nPlug in 55 for °F, and ºC = (55–32) × 5 / 9 = 12.8°. But most people \ncan’t do this without pencil and paper because there are too many \nintermediate numbers to maintain in STM.\nWant a simpler way? Try this approximation—you can do it in \nyour head, there is no need for paper or pencil:\n°C = (°F–30) / 2\nPlug in 55 for °F, and ºC = (55–30) / 2 = 12.5º. Is the equation an \nexact conversion? No, but the approximate answer of 12.5 is close \n\n\n102 The Design of Everyday Things\nenough to the correct value of 12.8. After all, I simply wanted to \nknow whether I should wear a sweater. Anything within 5ºF of the \nreal value would work for this purpose.\nApproximate answers are often good enough, even if technically \nwrong. This simple approximation method for temperature con-\nversion is “good enough” for temperatures in the normal range \nof interior and outside temperatures: it is within 3ºF (or 1.7ºC) in \nthe range of –5° to 25ºC (20° to 80ºF). It gets further off at lower or \nhigher temperatures, but for everyday use, it is wonderful. Ap-\nproximations are good enough for practical use.\nEXAMPLE 2: A MODEL OF SHORT-TERM MEMORY\nHere is an approximate model for STM:\nThere are five memory slots in short-term memory. Each time a new \nitem is added, it occupies a slot, knocking out whatever was there \nbeforehand.\nIs this model true? No, not a single memory researcher in the \nentire world believes this to be an accurate model of STM. But it is \ngood enough for applications. Make use of this model, and your \ndesigns will be more usable.\nEXAMPLE 3: STEERING A MOTORCYCLE\nIn the preceding section, we learned how Professor Sayeki mapped \nthe turning directions of his motorcycle to his turn signals, enabling \nhim to remember their correct usage. But there, I also pointed out \nthat the conceptual model was wrong.\nWhy is the conceptual model for steering a motorcycle useful \neven though it is wrong? Steering a motorcycle is counterintuitive: \nto turn to the left, the handlebars must first be turned to the right. \nThis is called countersteering, and it violates most people’s concep-\ntual models. Why is this true? Shouldn’t we rotate the handlebars \nleft to turn the bike left? The most important component of turning \na two-wheeled vehicle is lean: when the bike is turning left, the \nrider is leaning to the left. Countersteering causes the rider to lean \n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World 103\nproperly: when the handlebars are turned to the right, the resulting \nforces upon the rider cause the body to lean left. This weight shift \nthen causes the bike to turn left.\nExperienced riders often do the correct operations subcon-\nsciously, unaware that they start a turn by rotating the handlebars \nopposite from the intended direction, thus violating their own \nconceptual models. Motorcycle training courses have to conduct \nspecial exercises to convince riders that this is what they are doing.\nYou can test this counterintuitive concept on a bicycle or motor-\ncycle by getting up to a comfortable speed, placing the palm of the \nhand on the end of the left handlebar, and gently pushing it forward. \nThe handlebars and front wheel will turn to the right and the body \nwill lean to the left, resulting in the bike—and the handlebars—\nturning to the left.\nProfessor Sayeki was fully aware of this contradiction between \nhis mental scheme and reality, but he wanted his memory aid to \nmatch his conceptual model. Conceptual models are powerful ex-\nplanatory devices, useful in a variety of circumstances. They do \nnot have to be accurate as long as they lead to the correct behavior \nin the desired situation.\nEXAMPLE 4: “GOOD ENOUGH” ARITHMETIC\nMost of us can’t multiply two large numbers in our head: we forget \nwhere we are along the way. Memory experts can multiply two \nlarge numbers quickly and effortlessly in their heads, amazing au-\ndiences with their skills. Moreover, the numbers come out left to \nright, the way we use them, not right to left, as we write them while \nlaboriously using pencil and paper to compute the answers. These \nexperts use special techniques that minimize the load on working \nmemory, but they do so at the cost of having to learn numerous \nspecial methods for different ranges and forms of problems.\nIsn’t this something we should all learn? Why aren’t school \nsystems teaching this? My answer is simple: Why bother? I can \nestimate the answer in my head with reasonable accuracy, often \ngood enough for the purpose. When I need precision and accuracy, \nwell, that’s what calculators are for.\n\n\n104 The Design of Everyday Things\nRemember my earlier example, to multiply 27 times 293 in your \nhead? Why would anyone need to know the precise answer? \nan approximate answer is good enough, and pretty easy to get. \nChange 27 to 30, and 293 to 300: 30 × 300 = 9,000 (3 × 3 = 9, and \nadd back the three zeros). The accurate answer is 7,911, so the es-\ntimate of 9,000 is only 14 percent too large. In many instances, this \nis good enough. Want a bit more accuracy? We changed 27 to 30 \nto make the multiplication easier. That’s 3 too large. So subtract \n3 × 300 from the answer (9,000 – 900). Now we get 8,100, which is \naccurate within 2 percent.\nIt is rare that we need to know the answers to complex arithmetic \nproblems with great precision: almost always, a rough estimate is \ngood enough. When precision is required, use a calculator. That’s \nwhat machines are good for: providing great precision. For most \npurposes, estimates are good enough. Machines should focus on \nsolving arithmetic problems. People should focus on higher-level \nissues, such as the reason the answer was needed.\nUnless it is your ambition to become a nightclub performer and \namaze people with great skills of memory, here is a simpler way \nto dramatically enhance both memory and accuracy: write things \ndown. Writing is a powerful technology: why not use it? Use a pad \nof paper, or the back of your hand. Write it or type it. Use a phone \nor a computer. Dictate it. This is what technology is for.\nThe unaided mind is surprisingly limited. It is things that make \nus smart. Take advantage of them.\nSCIENTIFIC THEORY VERSUS EVERYDAY PRACTICE\nScience strives for truth. As a result, scientists are always debating, \narguing, and disagreeing with one another. The scientific method \nis one of debate and conflict. Only ideas that have passed through \nthe critical examination of multiple other scientists survive. This \ncontinual disagreement often seems strange to the nonscientist, for \nit appears that scientists don’t know anything. Select almost any \ntopic, and you will discover that scientists who work in that area \nare continually disagreeing.\n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World 105\nBut the disagreements are illusory. That is, most scientists usu-\nally agree about the broad details: their disagreements are often \nabout tiny details that are important for distinguishing between \ntwo competing theories, but that might have very little impact in \nthe real world of practice and applications.\nIn the real, practical world, we don’t need absolute truth: ap-\nproximate models work just fine. Professor Sayeki’s simplified \nconceptual model of steering his motorcycle enabled him to re-\nmember which way to move the switches for his turn signals; \nthe simplified equation for temperature conversion and the sim-\nplified model of approximate arithmetic enabled “good enough” \nanswers in the head. The simplified model of STM provides \nuseful design guidance, even if it is scientifically wrong. Each of \nthese approximations is wrong, yet all are valuable in minimizing \nthought, resulting in quick, easy results whose accuracy is “good \nenough.”\nKnowledge in the Head\nKnowledge in the world, external knowledge, is a valuable tool \nfor remembering, but only if it is available at the right place, at the \nright time, in the appropriate situation. Otherwise, we must use \nknowledge in the head, in the mind. A folk saying captures this \nsituation well: “Out of sight, out of mind.” Effective memory uses \nall the clues available: knowledge in the world and in the head, \ncombining world and mind. We have already seen how the com-\nbination allows us to function quite well in the world even though \neither source of knowledge, by itself, is insufficient.\nHOW PILOTS REMEMBER WHAT \nAIR-TRAFFIC CONTROL TELLS THEM\nAirplane pilots have to listen to commands from air-traffic control \ndelivered at a rapid pace, and then respond accurately. Their lives \ndepend upon being able to follow the instructions accurately. One \nwebsite, discussing the problem, gave this example of instructions \nto a pilot about to take off for a flight:\n\n\n106 The Design of Everyday Things\nFrasca 141, cleared to Mesquite airport, via turn left heading 090, radar \nvectors to Mesquite airport. Climb and maintain 2,000. Expect 3,000 \n10 minutes after departure. Departure frequency 124.3, squawk 5270.\n(Typical Air traffic control sequence, usually spoken extremely rapidly. \nText from “ATC Phraseology,” on numerous websites, with no credit for \noriginator.)\n“How can we remember all that,” asked one novice pilot, “when \nwe are trying to focus on taking off?” Good question. Taking off \nis a busy, dangerous procedure with a lot going on, both inside \nand outside the airplane. How do pilots remember? Do they have \nsuperior memories?\nPilots use three major techniques:\n1. They write down the critical information.\n2.  They enter it into their equipment as it is told to them, so minimal \nmemory is required.\n3. They remember some of it as meaningful phrases.\nAlthough to the outside observer, all the instructions and num-\nbers seem random and confusing, to the pilots they are familiar \nnames, familiar numbers. As one respondent pointed out, those \nare common numbers and a familiar pattern for a takeoff. “Frasca \n141” is the name of the airplane, announcing the intended recipient \nof these instructions. The first critical item to remember is to turn \nleft to a compass direction of 090, then climb to an altitude of 2,000 \nfeet. Write those two numbers down. Enter the radio frequency \n124.3 into the radio as you hear it—but most of the time this fre-\nquency is known in advance, so the radio is probably already set \nto it. All you have to do is look at it and see that it is set properly. \nSimilarly, setting the “squawk box to 5270” is the special code the \nairplane sends whenever it is hit by a radar signal, identifying the \nairplane to the air-traffic controllers. Write it down, or set it into \nthe equipment as it is being said. As for the one remaining item, \n“Expect 3,000 10 minutes after departure,” nothing need be done. \nThis is just reassurance that in ten minutes, Frasca 141 will proba-\n",

They transform the new knowledge \nthey have just received into memory in the world, sometimes by \nwriting, sometimes by using the airplane’s equipment.\nThe design implication? The easier it is to enter the information \ninto the relevant equipment as it is heard, the less chance of mem-\nory error. The air-traffic control system is evolving to help. The \ninstructions from the air-traffic controllers will be sent digitally, \nso that they can remain displayed on a screen as long as the pilot \nwishes. The digital transmission also makes it easy for automated \nequipment to set itself to the correct parameters. Digital transmis-\nsion of the controller’s commands has some disadvantages, however. \nOther aircraft will not hear the commands, which reduces pilot \nawareness of what all the airplanes in the vicinity are going to do. \nResearchers in air-traffic control and aviation safety are looking \ninto these issues. Yes, it’s a design issue.\nREMINDING: PROSPECTIVE MEMORY\nThe phrases prospective memory or memory for the future might sound \ncounterintuitive, or perhaps like the title of a science-fiction novel, \nbut to memory researchers, the first phrase simply denotes the task \nof remembering to do some activity at a future time. The second \nphrase denotes planning abilities, the ability to imagine future sce-\nnarios. Both are closely related.\nConsider reminding. Suppose you have promised to meet some \nfriends at a local café on Wednesday at three thirty in the after-\nnoon. The knowledge is in your head, but how are you going to \nremember it at the proper time? You need to be reminded. This is \na clear instance of prospective memory, but your ability to provide \nthe required cues involves some aspect of memory for the future as \nwell. Where will you be Wednesday just before the planned meet-\ning? What can you think of now that will help you remember then?\nThere are many strategies for reminding. One is simply to keep \nthe knowledge in your head, trusting yourself to recall it at the \n\n\n108 The Design of Everyday Things\ncritical time. If the event is important enough, you will have no \nproblem remembering it. It would be quite strange to have to set a \ncalendar alert to remind yourself, “Getting married at 3 PM.”\nRelying upon memory in the head is not a good technique for \ncommonplace events. Ever forget a meeting with friends? It hap-\npens a lot. Not only that, but even if you might remember the \nappointment, will you remember all the details, such as that you \nintended to loan a book to one of them? Going shopping, you may \nremember to stop at the store on the way home, but will you re-\nmember all the items you were supposed to buy?\nIf the event is not personally important and several days away, it \nis wise to transfer some of the burden to the world: notes, calendar \nreminders, special cell phone or computer reminding services. You \ncan ask friends to remind you. Those of us with assistants put the \nburden on them. They, in turn, write notes, enter events on calen-\ndars, or set alarms on their computer systems.\nWhy burden other people when we can put the burden on \nthe thing itself? Do I want to remember to take a book to a col-\nleague? I put the book someplace where I cannot fail to see it when \nI leave the house. A good spot is against the front door so that I \ncan’t leave without tripping over it. Or I can put my car keys on it, \nso when I leave, I am reminded. Even if I forget, I can’t drive away \nwithout the keys. (Better yet, put the keys under the book, else I \nmight still forget the book.)\nThere are two different aspects to a reminder: the signal and the \nmessage. Just as in doing an action we can distinguish between \nknowing what can be done and knowing how to do it, in reminding \nwe must distinguish between the signal—knowing that something \nis to be remembered, and the message—remembering the infor-\nmation itself. Most popular reminding methods typically provide \nonly one or the other of these two critical aspects. The famous “tie \na string around your finger” reminder provides only the signal. It \ngives no hint of what is to be remembered. Writing a note to yourself \nprovides only the message; it doesn’t remind you ever to look at it. \nThe ideal reminder has to have both components: the signal that \nsomething is to be remembered, and then the message of what it is.\n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World 109\nThe signal that something is to be remembered can be a suffi-\ncient memory cue if it occurs at the correct time and place. Being \nreminded too early or too late is just as useless as having no re-\nminder. But if the reminder comes at the correct time or location, \nthe environmental cue can suffice to provide enough knowledge to \naid retrieval of the to-be-remembered item. Time-based reminders \ncan be effective: the bing of my cell phone reminds me of the next \nappointment. Location-based reminders can be effective in giving \nthe cue at the precise place where it will be needed. All the knowl-\nedge needed can reside in the world, in our technology.\nThe need for timely reminders has created loads of products that \nmake it easier to put the knowledge in the world—timers, diaries, \ncalendars. The need for electronic reminders is well known, as the \nproliferation of apps for smart phones, tablets, and other portable \ndevices attests. Yet surprisingly in this era of screen-based devices, \npaper tools are still enormously popular and effective, as the num-\nber of paper-based diaries and reminders indicates.\nThe sheer number of different reminder methods also indicates \nthat there is indeed a great need for assistance in remembering, but \nthat none of the many schemes and devices is completely satisfac-\ntory. After all, if any one of them was, then we wouldn’t need so \nmany. The less effective ones would disappear and new schemes \nwould not continually be invented.\nThe Tradeoff Between Knowledge \nin the World and in the Head\nKnowledge in the world and knowledge in the head are both es-\nsential in our daily functioning. But to some extent we can choose \nto lean more heavily on one or the other. That choice requires a \ntradeoff—gaining the advantages of knowledge in the world \nmeans losing the advantages of knowledge in the head (Table 3.1).\nKnowledge in the world acts as its own reminder. It can help \nus recover structures that we otherwise would forget. Knowledge \nin the head is efficient: no search and interpretation of the envi-\nronment is required. The tradeoff is that to use our knowledge in \nthe head, we have to be able to store and retrieve it, which might \n\n\n110 The Design of Everyday Things\nrequire considerable amounts of learning. Knowledge in the world \nrequires no learning, but can be more difficult to use. And it relies \nheavily upon the continued physical presence of the knowledge; \nchange the environment and the knowledge might be lost. Perfor-\nmance relies upon the physical stability of the task environment.\nAs we just discussed, reminders provide a good example of the \nrelative tradeoffs between knowledge in the world versus in \nthe head. Knowledge in the world is accessible. It is self-reminding. \nIt is always there, waiting to be seen, waiting to be used. That is \nwhy we structure our offices and our places of work so carefully. \nWe put piles of papers where they can be seen, or if we like a clean \ndesk, we put them in standardized locations and teach ourselves \n(knowledge in the head) to look in these standard places routinely. \nWe use clocks and calendars and notes.

We can’t count on something \nbeing present in mind at any particular time, unless it is triggered \nby some external event or unless we deliberately keep it in mind \nthrough constant repetition (which then prevents us from having \nother conscious thoughts). Out of sight, out of mind.\nAs we move away from many physical aids, such as printed \nbooks and magazines, paper notes, and calendars, much of what \nwe use today as knowledge in the world will become invisible. Yes, \nit will all be available on display screens, but unless the screens \nalways show this material, we will have added to the burden of \nmemory in the head. We may not have to remember all the details \nof the information stored away for us, but we will have to remem-\nber that it is there, that it needs to be redisplayed at the appropriate \ntime for use or for reminding.\nMemory in Multiple Heads, Multiple Devices\nIf knowledge and structure in the world can combine with knowl-\nedge in the head to enhance memory performance, why not use \nthe knowledge in multiple heads, or in multiple devices?\nMost of us have experienced the power of multiple minds in \nremembering things. You are with a group of friends trying to re-\nmember the name of a movie, or perhaps a restaurant, and failing. \nBut others try to help. The conversation goes something like this:\n“That new place where they grill meat”\n“Oh, the Korean barbecue on Fifth Street?”\n“No, not Korean, South American, um,“\n“Oh, yeah, Brazilian, it’s what’s its name?”\n“Yes, that’s the one!”\n“Pampas something.”\n“Yes, Pampas Chewy. Um, Churry, um,”\n“Churrascaria. Pampas Churrascaria.”\nHow many people are involved? It could be any number, but the \npoint is that each adds their bit of knowledge, slowly constraining \nthe choices, recalling something that no single one of them could \n\n\n112 The Design of Everyday Things\nhave done alone. Daniel Wegner, a Harvard professor of psychol-\nogy, has called this “transactive memory.”\nOf course, we often turn to technological aids to answer our \nquestions, reaching for our smart devices to search our electronic \nresources and the Internet. When we expand from seeking aids \nfrom other people to seeking aids from our technologies, which \nWegner labels as “cybermind,” the principle is basically the same. \nThe cybermind doesn’t always produce the answer, but it can \nproduce sufficient clues so that we can generate the answer. Even \nwhere the technology produces the answer, it is often buried in a \nlist of potential answers, so we have to use our own knowledge—\nor the knowledge of our friends—to determine which of the poten-\ntial items is the correct one.\nWhat happens when we rely too much upon external knowledge, \nbe it knowledge in the world, knowledge of friends, or knowledge \nprovided by our technology? On the one hand, there no such thing \nas “too much.” The more we learn to use these resources, the bet-\nter our performance. External knowledge is a powerful tool for \nenhanced intelligence. On the other hand, external knowledge is \noften erroneous: witness the difficulties of trusting online sources \nand the controversies that arise over Wikipedia entries. It doesn’t \nmatter where our knowledge comes from. What matters is the \nquality of the end result.\nIn an earlier book, Things That Make Us Smart, I argued that it \nis this combination of technology and people that creates super-\npowerful beings. Technology does not make us smarter. People \ndo not make technology smart. It is the combination of the two, \nthe person plus the artifact, that is smart. Together, with our tools, \nwe are a powerful combination. On the other hand, if we are sud-\ndenly without these external devices, then we don’t do very well. \nIn many ways, we do become less smart.\nTake away their calculator, and many people cannot do arith-\nmetic. Take away a navigation system, and people can no longer \nget around, even in their own cities. Take away a phone’s or com-\nputer’s address book, and people can no longer reach their friends \n(in my case, I can no longer remember my own phone number). \n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n113\nWithout a keyboard, I can’t write. Without a spelling corrector, I \ncan’t spell.\nWhat does all of this mean? Is this bad or good? It is not a new \nphenomenon. Take away our gas supply and electrical service and \nwe might starve. Take away our housing and clothes and we might \nfreeze. We rely on commercial stores, transportation, and gov-\nernment services to provide us with the essentials for living. Is \nthis bad?\nThe partnership of technology and people makes us smarter, \nstronger, and better able to live in the modern world. We have \nbecome reliant on the technology and we can no longer function \nwithout it. The dependence is even stronger today than ever before, \nincluding mechanical, physical things such as housing, clothing, \nheating, food preparation and storage, and transportation. Now \nthis range of dependencies is extended to information services as \nwell: communication, news, entertainment, education, and social \ninteraction. When things work, we are informed, comfortable, and \neffective. When things break, we may no longer be able to function. \nThis dependence upon technology is very old, but every decade, \nthe impact covers more and more activities.\nNatural Mapping\nMapping, a topic from Chapter 1, provides a good example of \nthe power of combining knowledge in the world with that in the \nhead. Did you ever turn the wrong burner of a stove on or off? \nYou would think that doing it correctly would be an easy task. \nA simple control turns the burner on, controls the temperature, \nand allows the burner to be turned off. In fact, the task appears to \nbe so simple that when people do it wrong, which happens more \nfrequently than you might have thought, they blame themselves: \n“How could I be so stupid as to do this simple task wrong?” they \nthink to themselves. Well, it isn’t so simple, and it is not their fault: \neven as simple a device as the everyday kitchen stove is frequently \nbadly designed, in a way that guarantees the errors.\nMost stoves have only four burners and four controls in one-\nto-one correspondence. Why is it so hard to remember four things? \n\n\n114 The Design of Everyday Things\nIn principle, it should be easy to remember the relationship be-\ntween the controls and the burners. In practice, however, it is al-\nmost impossible. Why? Because of the poor mappings between the \ncontrols and the burners. Look at Figure 3.2, which depicts four \npossible mappings between the four burners and controls. Figures \n3.2A and B show how not to map one dimension onto two. Figures \n3.2C and D show two ways of doing it properly: arrange the con-\ntrols in two dimensions (C) or stagger the burners (D) so they can \nbe ordered left to right.\nBACK\nFRONT\nBACK\nFRONT\nBACK\nFRONT\nBACK\nFRONT\nFIGURE 3.2. Mappings of Stove Controls with Burners. With the tradi-\ntional arrangement of stove burners shown in Figures A and B, the burners \nare arranged in a rectangle and the controls in a linear line. Usually there \nis a partial natural mapping, with the left two controls operating the left \nburners and the right two controls operating the right burners. Even so, \nthere are four possible mappings of controls to burners, all four of which \nare used on commercial stoves. The only way to  know which control \nworks which burner is to read the labels. But if the controls were also in a \nrectangle (Figure C) or the burners staggered (Figure D), no labels would \nbe needed. Learning would be easy; errors would be reduced.\nA.\nC.\nB.\nD.\n",

If all stoves used the same arrange-\nment of controls, even if it is unnatural, everyone could learn it \nonce and forever after get things right. As the legend of Figure \n3.2 points out, even if the stove manufacturer is nice enough to \nensure that each pair of controls operates the pair of burners on its \nside, there are still four possible mappings. All four are in common \nuse. Some stoves arrange the controls in a vertical line, giving even \nmore possible mappings. Every stove seems to be different. Even \ndifferent stoves from the same manufacturer differ. No wonder \npeople have trouble, leading their food to go uncooked, and in the \nworst cases, leading to fire.\nNatural mappings are those where the relationship between the \ncontrols and the object to be controlled (the burners, in this case) \nis obvious. Depending upon circumstances, natural mappings will \nemploy spatial cues. Here are three levels of mapping, arranged in \ndecreasing effectiveness as memory aids:\n•  Best mapping: Controls are mounted directly on the item to be con-\ntrolled.\n•   Second-best mapping: Controls are as close as possible to the object \nto be controlled.\n•  Third-best mapping: Controls are arranged in the same spatial con-\nfiguration as the objects to be controlled.\nIn the ideal and second-best cases, the mappings are indeed clear \nand unambiguous.\nWant excellent examples of natural mapping? Consider gesture-\ncontrolled faucets, soap dispensers, and hand dryers. Put your \nhands under the faucet or soap dispenser and the water or soap \nappears. Wave your hand in front of the paper towel dispenser \nand out pops a new towel, or in the case of blower-controlled \nhand dryers, simply put your hands beneath or into the dryer \nand the drying air turns on. Mind you, although the mappings of \nthese devices are appropriate, they do have problems. First, they \noften lack signifiers, hence they lack discoverability. The controls \n\n\n116 The Design of Everyday Things\nare often invisible, so we sometimes put our hands under faucets \nexpecting to receive water, but wait in vain: these are mechan-\nical faucets that require handle turning. Or the water turns on \nand then stops, so we wave our hands up and down, hoping to \nfind the precise location where the water turns on. When I wave \nmy hand in front of the towel dispenser but get no towel, I do \nnot know whether this means the dispenser is broken or out of \ntowels; or that I did the waving wrong, or in the wrong place; or \nthat maybe this doesn’t work by gesture, but I must push, pull, \nor turn something. The lack of signifiers is a real drawback. These \ndevices aren’t perfect, but at least they got the mapping right.\nIn the case of stove controls, it is obviously not possible to put \nthe controls directly on the burners. In most cases, it is also dan-\ngerous to put the controls adjacent to the burners, not only for fear \nof burning the person using the stove, but also because it would \ninterfere with the placement of cooking utensils. Stove controls are \nusually situated on the side, back, or front panel of the stove, in \nwhich case they ought to be arranged in spatial harmony with the \nburners, as in Figures 3.2 C and D.\nWith a good natural mapping, the relationship of the controls to \nthe burner is completely contained in the world; the load on hu-\nman memory is much reduced. With a bad mapping, however, a \nburden is placed upon memory, leading to more mental effort and \na higher chance of error. Without a good mapping, people new to \nthe stove cannot readily determine which burner goes with which \ncontrol and even frequent users will still occasionally err.\nWhy do stove designers insist on arranging the burners in a \ntwo-dimensional rectangular pattern, and the controls in a one-\ndimensional row? We have known for roughly a century just \nhow bad such an arrangement is. Sometimes the stove comes \nwith clever little diagrams to indicate which control works which \nburner. Sometimes there are labels. But the proper natural map-\nping requires no diagrams, no labels, and no instructions.\nThe irony about stove design is that it isn’t hard to do right. Text-\nbooks of ergonomics, human factors, psychology, and industrial \nengineering have been demonstrating both the problems and the \n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n117\nsolutions for over fifty years. Some stove manufacturers do use \ngood designs. Oddly, sometimes the best and the worst designs are \nmanufactured by the same companies and are illustrated side by \nside in their catalogs. Why do users still purchase stoves that cause \nso much trouble? Why not revolt and refuse to buy them unless the \ncontrols have an intelligent relationship to the burners?\nThe problem of the stovetop may seem trivial, but similar map-\nping problems exist in many situations, including commercial and \nindustrial settings, where selecting the wrong button, dial, or lever \ncan lead to major economic impact or even fatalities.\nIn industrial settings good mapping is of special importance, \nwhether it is a remotely piloted airplane, a large building crane \nwhere the operator is at a distance from the objects being manip-\nulated, or even in an automobile where the driver might wish to \ncontrol temperature or windows while driving at high speeds or in \ncrowded streets. In these cases, the best controls usually are spatial \nmappings of the controls to the items being controlled. We see this \ndone properly in most automobiles where the driver can operate \nthe windows through switches that are arranged in spatial corre-\nspondence to the windows.\nUsability is not often thought about during the purchasing pro-\ncess. Unless you actually test a number of units in a realistic envi-\nronment, doing typical tasks, you are not likely to notice the ease or \ndifficulty of use. If you just look at something, it appears straight-\nforward enough, and the array of wonderful features seems to be \na virtue. You may not realize that you won’t be able to figure out \nhow to use those features. I urge you to test products before you buy \nthem. Before purchasing a new stovetop, pretend you are cooking \na meal. Do it right there in the store. Do not be afraid to make mis-\ntakes or ask stupid questions. Remember, any problems you have \nare probably the design’s fault, not yours.\nA major obstacle is that often the purchaser is not the user. Ap-\npliances may be in a home when people move in. In the office, the \npurchasing department orders equipment based upon such factors \nas price, relationships with the supplier, and perhaps reliability: \nusability is seldom considered. Finally, even when the purchaser \n\n\n118 The Design of Everyday Things\nis the end user, it is sometimes necessary to trade off one desirable \nfeature for an undesirable one. In the case of my family’s stove, \nwe did not like the arrangement of controls, but we bought the \nstove anyway: we traded off the layout of the burner controls for \nanother design feature that was more important to us and available \nonly from one manufacturer. But why should we have to make a \ntradeoff? It wouldn’t be hard for all stove manufacturers to use \nnatural mappings, or at the least, to standardize their mappings.\nCulture and Design: \nNatural Mappings Can Vary with Culture\nI was in Asia, giving a talk. My computer was connected to a pro-\njector and I was given a remote controller for advancing through \nthe illustrations for my talk. This one had two buttons, one above \nthe other. The title was already displayed on the screen, so when I \nstarted, all I had to do was to advance to the first photograph in my \npresentation, but when I pushed the upper button, to my amaze-\nment I went backward through my illustrations, not forward.\n“How could this happen?” I wondered. To me, top means forward; \nbottom, backward. The mapping is clear and obvious. If the buttons \nhad been side by side, then the control would have been ambigu-\nous: which comes first, right or left? This controller appeared to use \nan appropriate mapping of top and bottom. Why was it working \nbackward? Was this yet another example of poor design?\nI decided to ask the audience. I showed them the controller and \nasked: “To get to my next picture, which button should I push, the \ntop or the bottom?” To my great surprise, the audience was split in \ntheir responses. Many thought that it should be the top button, just \nas I had thought. But a large number thought it should be the bottom.\nWhat’s the correct answer? I decided to ask this question to my \naudiences around the world. I discovered that they, too, were split \nin their opinions: some people firmly believe that it is the top but-\nton and some, just as firmly, believe it is the bottom button. Every-\none is surprised to learn that someone else might think differently.\nI was puzzled until I realized that this was a point-of-view prob-\nlem, very similar to the way different cultures view time. In some \n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n119\ncultures, time is represented mentally as if it were a road stretching \nout ahead of the person. As a person moves through time, the per-\nson moves forward along the time line. Other cultures use the same \nrepresentation, except now it is the person who is fixed and it is \ntime that moves: an event in the future moves toward the person.\nThis is precisely what was happening with the controller. Yes, \nthe top button does cause something to move forward, but the \nquestion is, what is moving? Some people thought that the person \nwould move through the images, other people thought the images \nwould move. People who thought that they moved through the \nimages wanted the top button to indicate the next one. People who \nthought it was the illustrations that moved would get to the next \nimage by pushing the bottom button, causing the images to move \ntoward them.\nSome cultures represent the time line vertically: up for the future, \ndown for the past. Other cultures have rather different views. For \nexample, does the future lie ahead or behind? To most of us, the \nquestion makes no sense: of course, the future lies ahead—the past \nis behind us. We speak this way, discussing the “arrival” of the fu-\nture; we are pleased that many unfortunate events of the past have \nbeen “left behind.”\nBut why couldn’t the past be in front of us and the future be-\nhind? Does that sound strange? Why? We can see what is in front \nof us, but not what is behind, just as we can remember what hap-\npened in the past, but we can’t remember the future. Not only that, \nbut we can remember recent events much more clearly than long-\npast events, captured neatly by the visual metaphor in which the \npast lines up before us, the most recent events being the closest \nso that they are clearly perceived (remembered), with long-past \nevents far in the distance, remembered and perceived with diffi-\nculty. Still sound weird? This is how the South American Indian \ngroup, the Aymara, represent time. When they speak of the future, \nthey use the phrase back days and often gesture behind them. Think \nabout it: it is a perfectly logical way to view the world.\nIf time is displayed along a horizontal line, does it go from left to \nright or right to left? Either answer is correct because the choice is \n\n\n120 The Design of Everyday Things\narbitrary, just as the choice of whether text should be strung along \nthe page from left to right or right to left is arbitrary. The choice of \ntext direction also corresponds to people’s preference for time di-\nrection. People whose native language is Arabic or Hebrew prefer \ntime to flow from right to left (the future being toward the left), \nwhereas those who use a left-to-right writing system have time \nflowing in the same direction, so the future is to the right.\nBut wait: I’m not finished. Is the time line relative to the person \nor relative to the environment? In some Australian Aborigine socie-\nties, time moves relative to the environment based on the direction \nin which the sun rises and sets. Give people from this community \na set of photographs structured in time (for example, photographs \nof a person at different ages or a child eating some food) and ask \nthem to order the photographs in time. People from technological \ncultures would order the pictures from left to right, most recent \nphoto to the right or left, depending upon how their printed lan-\nguage was written. But people from these Australian communities \nwould order them east to west, most recent to the west. If the per-\nson were facing south, the photo would be ordered left to right. If \nthe person were facing north, the photos would be ordered right to \nleft. If the person were facing west, the photos would be ordered \nalong a vertical line extending from the body outward, outwards \nbeing the most recent. And, of course, were the person facing east, \nthe photos would also be on a line extending out from the body, \nbut with the most recent photo closest to the body.\nThe choice of metaphor dictates the proper design for interac-\ntion. Similar issues show up in other domains. Consider the stan-\ndard problem of scrolling the text in a computer display. Should \nthe scrolling control move the text or the window? This was a \nfierce debate in the early years of display terminals, long before the \ndevelopment of modern computer systems. Eventually, there was \nmutual agreement that the cursor arrow keys—and then, later on, \nthe mouse—would follow the moving window metaphor. Move \nthe window down to see more text at the bottom of the screen. \nWhat this meant in practice is that to see more text at the bottom \nof the screen, move the mouse down, which moves the window \n\n\n \nthree: Knowledge in the Head and in the World \n121\ndown, so that the text moves up: the mouse and the text move \nin opposite directions. With the moving text metaphor, the mouse \nand the text move in the same directions: move the mouse up and \nthe text moves up. For over two decades, everyone moved the \nscrollbars and mouse down in order to make the text move up.\nBut then smart displays with touch-operated screens arrived. \nNow it was only natural to touch the text with the fingers and \nmove it up, down, right, or left directly: the text moved in the same \ndirection as the fingers. The moving text metaphor became prev-\nalent. In fact, it was no longer thought of as a metaphor: it was \nreal. But as people switched back and forth between traditional \ncomputer systems that used the moving window metaphor and \ntouch-screen systems that used the moving text model, confusion \nreigned. As a result, one major manufacturer of both computers \nand smart screens, Apple, switched everything to the moving text \nmodel, but no other company followed Apple’s lead. As I write \nthis, the confusion still exists. How will it end? I predict the de-\nmise of the moving window metaphor: touch-screens and control \npads will dominate, which will cause the moving text model to \ntake over. All systems will move the hands or controls in the same \ndirection as they wish the screen images to move. Predicting tech-\nnology is relatively easy compared to predictions of human behav-\nior, or in this case, the adoption of societal conventions. Will this \nprediction be true? You will be able to judge for yourself.\nSimilar issues occurred in aviation with the pilot’s attitude indi-\ncator, the display that indicates the airplane’s orientation (roll or \nbank and pitch). The instrument shows a horizontal line to indicate \nthe horizon with a silhouette of an airplane seen from behind. If \nthe wings are level and on a line with the horizon, the airplane \nis flying in level flight. Suppose the airplane turns to the left, \nso it banks (tilts) left. What should the display look like? Should \nit show a left-tilting airplane against a fixed horizon, or a fixed \nairplane against a right-tilting horizon? The first is correct from the \nviewpoint of someone watching the airplane from behind, where \nthe horizon is always horizontal: this type of display is called \noutside-in. The second is correct from the viewpoint of the pilot, \n\n\n122 The Design of Everyday Things\nwhere the airplane is always stable and fixed in position, so that \nwhen the airplane banks, the horizon tilts: this type of display is \ncalled inside-out.\nIn all these cases, every point of view is correct. It all depends \nupon what you consider to be moving. What does all this mean for \ndesign? What is natural depends upon point of view, the choice \nof metaphor, and therefore, the culture. The design difficulties \noccur when there is a switch in metaphors. Airplane pilots have \nto undergo training and testing before they are allowed to switch \nfrom one set of instruments (those with an outside-in metaphor, for \nexample) to the other (those with the inside-out metaphor). When \ncountries decided to switch which side of the road cars would \ndrive on, the temporary confusion that resulted was dangerous. \n(Most places that switched moved from left-side driving to right-\nside, but a few, notably Okinawa, Samoa, and East Timor, switched \nfrom right to left.) In all these cases of convention switches, people \neventually adjusted. It is possible to break convention and switch \nmetaphors, but expect a period of confusion until people adapt to \nthe new system.\n\n\n \n 123\nC H A P T E R  F O U R\nKNOWING WHAT \nTO DO: CONSTRAINTS, \nDISCOVERABILITY, \nAND FEEDBACK\nHow do we determine how to operate something that \nwe have never seen before? We have no choice but to \ncombine knowledge in the world with that in the head. \nKnowledge in the world includes perceived affordances \nand signifiers, the mappings between the parts that appear to \nbe controls or places to manipulate and the resulting actions, \nand the physical constraints that limit what can be done. \nKnowledge in the head includes conceptual models; cultural, \nsemantic, and logical constraints on behavior; and analogies \nbetween the current situation and previous experiences with \nother situations. Chapter 3 was devoted to a discussion of how \nwe acquire knowledge and use it. There, the major emphasis \nwas upon the knowledge in the head. This chapter focuses \nupon the knowledge in the world: how designers can provide \nthe critical information that allows people to know what to do, \neven when experiencing an unfamiliar device or situation.\nLet me illustrate with an example: building a motorcycle \nfrom a Lego set (a children’s construction toy). The Lego mo-\ntorcycle shown in Figure 4.1 has fifteen pieces, some rather spe-\ncialized. Of those fifteen pieces, only two pairs are alike—two \nrectangles with the word police on them, and the two hands of \n\n\n124 The Design of Everyday Things\nthe policeman. Other pieces match one another in size and shape \nbut are different colors. So, a number of the pieces are physically \ninterchangeable—that is, the physical constraints are not sufficient \nto identify where they go—but the appropriate role for every single \npiece of the motorcycle is still unambiguously determined. How? \nBy combining cultural, semantic, and logical constraints with the \nphysical ones. As a result, it is possible to construct the motorcycle \nwithout any instructions or assistance.\nIn fact, I did the experiment. I asked people to put together the \nparts; they had never seen the finished structure and were not even \ntold that it was a motorcycle (although it didn’t take them long to \nfigure this out). Nobody had any difficulty.\nThe visible affordances of the pieces were important in determin-\ning just how they fit together. The cylinders and holes character-\nistic of Lego suggested the major construction rule. The sizes and \nshapes of the parts suggested their operation. Physical constraints \nlimited what parts would fit together. Cultural and semantic con-\nstraints provided strong restrictions on what would make sense \nfor all but one of the remaining pieces, and with just one piece left \nand only one place it could possibly go, simple logic dictated the \nFIGURE 4.1. Lego Motorcycle. The toy Lego motorcycle is shown assembled (A) and \nin pieces (B). It has fifteen pieces so cleverly constructed that even an adult can put \nthem together. The design exploits constraints to specify just which pieces fit where. \nPhysical constraints limit alternative placements. Cultural and semantic constraints pro-\nvide the necessary clues for further decisions. For example, cultural constraints dictate \nthe placement of the three lights (red, blue, and yellow) and semantic constraints stop \nthe user from putting the head backward on the body or the pieces labeled “police” \nupside down.\nA.\nB.\n",

These four classes of constraints—physical, cultural, \nsemantic, and logical—seem to be universal, appearing in a wide \nvariety of situations.\nConstraints are powerful clues, limiting the set of possible ac-\ntions. The thoughtful use of constraints in design lets people read-\nily determine the proper course of action, even in a novel situation.\nFour Kinds of Constraints: \nPhysical, Cultural, Semantic, and Logical\nPHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS\nPhysical limitations constrain possible operations. Thus, a large \npeg cannot fit into a small hole. With the Lego motorcycle, the \nwindshield would fit in only one place. The value of physical con-\nstraints is that they rely upon properties of the physical world for \ntheir operation; no special training is necessary. With the proper \nuse of physical constraints, there should be only a limited number \nof possible actions—or, at least, desired actions can be made obvi-\nous, usually by being especially salient.\nPhysical constraints are made more effective and useful if they are \neasy to see and interpret, for then the set of actions is restricted be-\nfore anything has been done. Otherwise, a physical constraint pre-\nvents a wrong action from succeeding only after it has been tried.\nThe traditional cylindrical battery, Figure 4.2A, lacks sufficient \nphysical constraints. It can be put into battery compartments in \ntwo orientations: one that is correct, the other of which can damage \nthe equipment. The instructions in Figure 4.2B show that polarity \nis important, yet the inferior signifiers inside the battery compart-\nment makes it very difficult to determine the proper orientation \nfor the batteries.\nWhy not design a battery with which it would be impossible to \nmake an error: use physical constraints so that the battery will fit \nonly if properly oriented. Alternatively, design the battery or the \nelectrical contacts so that orientation doesn’t matter.\nFigure 4.3 shows a battery that has been designed so that orien-\ntation is irrelevant. Both ends of the battery are identical, with the \n\n\n126 The Design of Everyday Things\npositive and negative terminals for the battery being its center and \nmiddle rings, respectively. The contact for the positive polarity is \ndesigned so it contacts only the center ring. Similarly, the contact \nfor negative polarity touches only the middle ring. Although this \nseems to solve the problem, I have only seen this one example of \nsuch a battery: they are not widely available or used.\nAnother alternative is to invent battery contacts that allow our \nexisting cylindrical batteries to be inserted in either orientation yet \nstill work properly: Microsoft has invented this kind of contact, \nwhich it calls InstaLoad, and is attempting to convince equipment \nmanufacturers to use it.\nA third alternative is to design the shape of the battery so that \nit can fit in only one way. Most plug-in components do this well, \nusing shapes, notches, and protrusions to constrain insertion \n FIGURE 4.2. Cylindrical Battery: Where Constraints Are Needed. Figure A shows \nthe traditional cylindrical battery that requires correct orientation in the slot to work \nproperly (and to avoid damaging the equipment). But look at Figure B, which shows \nwhere two batteries are to be installed. The instructions from the manual are shown as \nan overlay to the photograph. They seem simple, but can you see into the dark recess to \nfigure out which end of each battery goes where? Nope. The lettering is black against \nblack: slightly raised shapes in the dark plastic.\n FIGURE 4.3. Making Battery Orientation \nIrrelevant. This photograph shows a battery \nwhose orientation doesn’t matter; it can be \ninserted into the equipment in either possi-\nble direction. How? Each end of the battery \nhas the same three concentric rings, with the \ncenter one on both ends being the “plus” ter-\nminal and the middle one being the “minus” \nterminal.\nA.\nB.\n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback 127\nto a single orientation. So why can’t our everyday batteries be \nthe same?\nWhy does inelegant design persist for so long? This is called the \nlegacy problem, and it will come up several times in this book. Too \nmany devices use the existing standard—that is the legacy. If the \nsymmetrical cylindrical battery were changed, there would also \nhave to be a major change in a huge number of products. The new \nbatteries would not work in older equipment, nor the old batteries \nin new equipment. Microsoft’s design of contacts would allow us \nto continue to use the same batteries we are used to, but the prod-\nucts would have to switch to the new contacts. Two years after Mi-\ncrosoft’s introduction of InstaLoad, despite positive press, I could \nfind no products that use them—not even Microsoft products.\nLocks and keys suffer from a similar problem. Although it is usu-\nally easy to distinguish the smooth top part of a key from its jagged \nunderside, it is difficult to tell from the lock just which orienta-\ntion of the key is required, especially in dark environments. Many \nelectrical and electronic plugs and sockets have the same problem. \nAlthough they do have physical constraints to prevent improper \ninsertion, it is often extremely difficult to perceive their correct ori-\nentation, especially when keyholes and electronic sockets are in \ndifficult-to-reach, dimly lit locations. Some devices, such as USB \nplugs, are constrained, but the constraint is so subtle that it takes \nmuch fussing and fumbling to find the correct orientation. Why \naren’t all these devices orientation insensitive?\nIt is not difficult to design keys and plugs that work regardless of \nhow they are inserted. Automobile keys that are insensitive to the \norientation have long existed, but not all manufacturers use them. \nSimilarly, many electrical connectors are insensitive to orientation, \nbut again, only a few manufacturers use them. Why the resistance? \nSome of it results from the legacy concerns about the expense of \nmassive change. But much seems to be a classic example of cor-\nporate thinking: “This is the way we have always done things. We \ndon’t care about the customer.” It is, of course, true that difficulty \nin inserting keys, batteries, or plugs is not a big enough issue to \naffect the decision of whether to purchase something, but still, the \n\n\n128 The Design of Everyday Things\nlack of attention to customer needs on even simple things is often \nsymptomatic of larger issues that have greater impact. \nNote that a superior solution would be to solve the fundamental \nneed—solving the root need. After all, we don’t really care about \nkeys and locks: what we need is some way of ensuring that only \nauthorized people can get access to whatever is being locked. \nInstead of redoing the shapes of physical keys, make them irrel-\nevant. Once this is recognized, a whole set of solutions present \nthemselves: combination locks that do not require keys, or key-\nless locks that can be operated only by authorized people. One \nmethod is through possession of an electronic wireless device, \nsuch as the identification badges that unlock doors when they \nare moved close to a sensor, or automobile keys that can stay in \nthe pocket or carrying case. Biometric devices could identify the \nperson through face or voice recognition, fingerprints, or other \nbiometric measures, such as iris patterns. This approach is dis-\ncussed in Chapter 3, page 91.\nCULTURAL CONSTRAINTS\nEach culture has a set of allowable actions for social situations. \nThus, in our own culture we know how to behave in a restaurant—\neven one we have never been to before. This is how we manage \nto cope when our host leaves us alone in a strange room, at a \nstrange party, with strange people. And this is why we sometimes \nfeel frustrated, so incapable of action, when we are confronted \nwith a restaurant or group of people from an unfamiliar culture, \nwhere our normally accepted behavior is clearly inappropriate and \nfrowned upon. Cultural issues are at the root of many of the prob-\nlems we have with new machines: there are as yet no universally \naccepted conventions or customs for dealing with them.\nThose of us who study these things believe that guidelines for \ncultural behavior are represented in the mind by schemas, knowl-\nedge structures that contain the general rules and information nec-\nessary for interpreting situations and for guiding behavior. In some \nstereotypical situations (for example, in a restaurant), the schemas \nmay be very specialized. Cognitive scientists Roger Schank and \n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback 129\nBob Abelson proposed that in these cases we follow “scripts” that \ncan guide the sequence of behavior. The sociologist Erving Goff-\nman calls the social constraints on acceptable behavior “frames,” \nand he shows how they govern behavior even when a person is in \na novel situation or novel culture. Danger awaits those who delib-\nerately violate the frames of a culture.\nThe next time you are in an elevator, try violating cultural norms \nand see how uncomfortable that makes you and the other people \nin the elevator. It doesn’t take much: Stand facing the rear. Or look \ndirectly at some of the passengers. In a bus or streetcar, give your \nseat to the next athletic-looking person you see (the act is especially \neffective if you are elderly, pregnant, or disabled).\nIn the case of the Lego motorcycle of Figure 4.1, cultural con-\nstraints determine the locations of the three lights of the motor-\ncycle, which are otherwise physically interchangeable. Red is the \nculturally defined standard for a brake light, which is placed in \nthe rear. And a police vehicle often has a blue flashing light on top. \nAs for the yellow piece, this is an interesting example of cultural \nchange: few people today remember that yellow used to be a stan-\ndard headlight color in Europe and a few other locations (Lego \ncomes from Denmark). Today, European and North American stan-\ndards require white headlights. As a result, figuring out that the \nyellow piece represents a headlight on the front of the motorcycle \nis no longer as easy as it used to be. Cultural constraints are likely \nto change with time.\nSEMANTIC CONSTRAINTS\nSemantics is the study of meaning. Semantic constraints are those \nthat rely upon the meaning of the situation to control the set of \npossible actions. In the case of the motorcycle, there is only one \nmeaningful location for the rider, who must sit facing forward. The \npurpose of the windshield is to protect the rider’s face, so it must \nbe in front of the rider. Semantic constraints rely upon our knowl-\nedge of the situation and of the world. Such knowledge can be a \npowerful and important clue. But just as cultural constraints can \nchange with time, so, too, can semantic ones. Extreme sports push \n\n\n130 The Design of Everyday Things\nthe boundaries of what we think of as meaningful and sensible. \nNew technologies change the meanings of things. And creative \npeople continually change how we interact with our technologies \nand one another. When cars become fully automated, communi-\ncating among themselves with wireless networks, what will be the \nmeaning of the red lights on the rear of the auto? That the car is \nbraking? But for whom would the signal be intended? The other \ncars would already know. The red light would become meaning-\nless, so it could either be removed or it could be redefined to indi-\ncate some other condition. The meanings of today may not be the \nmeanings of the future.\nLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS\nThe blue light of the Lego motorcycle presents a special problem. \nMany people had no knowledge that would help, but after all the \nother pieces had been placed on the motorcycle, there was only \none piece left, only one possible place to go. The blue light was \nlogically constrained.\nLogical constraints are often used by home dwellers who under-\ntake repair jobs. Suppose you take apart a leaking faucet to replace \na washer, but when you put the faucet together again, you discover \na part left over. Oops, obviously there was an error: the part should \nhave been installed. This is an example of a logical constraint.\nThe natural mappings discussed in Chapter 3 work by provid-\ning logical constraints. There are no physical or cultural principles \nhere; rather, there is a logical relationship between the spatial or \nfunctional layout of components and the things that they affect or \nare affected by. If two switches control two lights, the left switch \nshould work the left light; the right switch, the right light. If the \norientation of the lights and the switches differ, the natural map-\nping is destroyed. \nCULTURAL NORMS, CONVENTIONS, AND STANDARDS\nEvery culture has its own conventions. Do you kiss or shake hands \nwhen meeting someone? If kissing, on which cheek, and how many \ntimes? Is it an air kiss or an actual one? Or perhaps you bow, junior \n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback \n131\nperson first, and lowest. Or raise hands, or perhaps press them to-\ngether. Sniff? It is possible to spend a fascinating hour on the In-\nternet exploring the different forms of greetings used by different \ncultures. It is also amusing to watch the consternation when people \nfrom more cool, formal countries first encounter people from warm-\nhearted, earthy countries, as one tries to bow and shake hands and \nthe other tries to hug and kiss even total strangers. It is not so amus-\ning to be one of those people: being hugged or kissed while trying \nto shake hands or bow. Or the other way around. Try kissing some-\none’s cheek three times (left, right, left) when the person expects \nonly one. Or worse, where he or she expects a handshake. Violation \nof cultural conventions can completely disrupt an interaction.\nConventions are actually a form of cultural constraint, usually \nassociated with how people behave. Some conventions determine \nwhat activities should be done; others prohibit or discourage ac-\ntions. But in all cases, they provide those knowledgeable of the \nculture with powerful constraints on behavior.\nSometimes these conventions are codified into international stan-\ndards, sometimes into laws, and sometimes both. In the early days \nof heavily traveled streets, whether by horses and buggies or by \nautomobiles, congestion and accidents arose. Over time, conven-\ntions developed about which side of the road to drive on, with dif-\nferent conventions in different countries. Who had precedence at \ncrossings? The first person to get there? The vehicle or person on \nthe right, or the person with the highest social status? All of these \nconventions have applied at one time or another. Today, worldwide \nstandards govern many traffic situations: Drive on only one side of \nthe street. The first car into an intersection has precedence. If both \narrive at the same time, the car on the right (or left) has precedence. \nWhen merging traffic lanes, alternate cars—one from that lane, \nthen one from this. The last rule is more of an informal convention: \nit is not part of any rule book that I am aware of, and although it \nis very nicely obeyed in the California streets on which I drive, the \nvery concept would seem strange in some parts of the world.\nSometimes conventions clash. In Mexico, when two cars ap-\nproach a narrow, one-lane bridge from opposite directions, if a car \n\n\n132 The Design of Everyday Things\nblinks its headlights, it means, “I got here first and I’m going over \nthe bridge.” In England, if a car blinks its lights, it means, “I see \nyou: please go first.” Either signal is equally appropriate and use-\nful, but not if the two drivers follow different conventions. Imagine \na Mexican driver meeting an English driver in some third country. \n(Note that driving experts warn against using headlight blinks as \nsignals because even within any single country, either interpreta-\ntion is held by many drivers, none of whom imagines someone else \nmight have the opposite interpretation.)\nEver get embarrassed at a formal dinner party where there ap-\npear to be dozens of utensils at each place setting? What do you \ndo? Do you drink that nice bowl of water or is it for dipping your \nfingers to clean them? Do you eat a chicken drumstick or slice of \npizza with your fingers or with a knife and fork?\nDo these issues matter? Yes, they do. Violate conventions and \nyou are marked as an outsider. A rude outsider, at that.\nApplying Affordances, Signifiers, and \nConstraints to Everyday Objects\nAffordances, signifiers, mappings, and constraints can simplify our \nencounters with everyday objects. Failure to properly deploy these \ncues leads to problems.\nTHE PROBLEM WITH DOORS\nIn Chapter 1 we encountered the sad story of my friend who was \ntrapped between sets of glass doors at a post office, trapped be-\ncause there were no clues to the doors’ operation. To operate a \ndoor, we have to find the side that opens and the part to be manip-\nulated; in other words, we need to figure out what to do and where \nto do it. We expect to find some visible signal, a signifier, for the \ncorrect operation: a plate, an extension, a hollow, an indentation—\nsomething that allows the hand to touch, grasp, turn, or fit into. \nThis tells us where to act. The next step is to figure out how: we \nmust determine what operations are permitted, in part by using \nthe signifiers, in part guided by constraints.\n",

Some open only if a button is \npushed, and some don’t indicate how to open at all, having nei-\nther buttons, nor hardware, nor any other sign of their opera-\ntion. The door might be operated with a foot pedal. Or maybe it \nis voice operated, and we must speak the magic phrase (“Open \nSimsim!”). In addition, some doors have signs on them, to pull, \npush, slide, lift, ring a bell, insert a card, type a password, smile, \nrotate, bow, dance, or, perhaps, just ask. Somehow, when a device \nas simple as a door has to have a sign telling you whether to pull, \npush, or slide, then it is a failure, poorly designed.\nConsider the hardware for an unlocked door. It need not have \nany moving parts: it can be a fixed knob, plate, handle, or groove. \nNot only will the proper hardware operate the door smoothly, but \nit will also indicate just how the door is to be operated: it will in-\ncorporate clear and unambiguous clues—signifiers. Suppose the \ndoor opens by being pushed. The easiest way to indicate this is to \nhave a plate at the spot where the pushing should be done.\nFlat plates or bars can clearly and unambiguously signify both \nthe proper action and its location, for their affordances constrain \nthe possible actions to that of pushing. Remember the discussion \nof the fire door and its panic bar in Chapter 2 (Figure 2.5, page 60)? \nThe panic bar, with its large horizontal surface, often with a sec-\nondary color on the part intended to be pushed, provides a good \nexample of an unambiguous signifier. It very nicely constrains \nimproper behavior when panicked people press against the door \nas they attempt to flee a fire. The best push bars offer both visible \naffordances that act as physical constraints on the action, and also \na visible signifier, thereby unobtrusively specifying what to do and \nwhere to do it.\nSome doors have appropriate hardware, well placed. The outside \ndoor handles of most modern automobiles are excellent examples \nof design. The handles are often recessed receptacles that simul-\ntaneously indicate the place and mode of action. Horizontal slits \nguide the hand into a pulling position; vertical slits signal a sliding \nmotion. Strangely enough, the inside door handles for automobiles \n\n\n134 The Design of Everyday Things\ntell a different story. Here, the designer has faced a different kind \nof problem, and the appropriate solution has not yet been found. \nAs a result, although the outside door handles of cars are often \nexcellent, the inside ones are often difficult to find, hard to figure \nout how to operate, and awkward to use.\nFrom my experience, the worst offenders are cabinet doors. It \nis sometimes not even possible to determine where the doors are, \nlet alone whether and how they are slid, lifted, pushed, or pulled. \nThe focus on aesthetics may blind the designer (and the purchaser) \nto the lack of usability. A particularly frustrating design is that of \nthe cabinet door that opens outward by being pushed inward. The \npush releases the catch and energizes a spring, so that when the hand \nis taken away, the door springs open. It’s a very clever design, but \nmost puzzling to the first-time user. A plate would be the appropri-\nate signal, but designers do not wish to mar the smooth surface of \nthe door. One of the cabinets in my home has one of these latches \nin its glass door. Because the glass affords visibility of the shelves \ninside, it is obvious that there is no room for the door to open inward; \ntherefore, to push the door seems contradictory. New and infre-\nquent users of this door usually reject pushing and open it by pull-\ning, which often requires them to use fingernails, knife blades, or \nmore ingenious methods to pry it open. A similar, counterintuitive \ntype of design was the source of my difficulties in emptying the \ndirty water from my sink in a London hotel (Figure 1.4, page 17).\nAppearances deceive. I have seen people trip and fall when \nthey attempted to push open a door that worked automatically, \nthe door opening inward just as they attempted to push against \nit. On most subway trains, the doors open automatically at each \nstation. Not so in Paris. I watched someone on the Paris Métro \ntry to get off the train and fail. When the train came to his station, \nhe got up and stood patiently in front of the door, waiting for it \nto open. It never opened. The train simply started up again and \nwent on to the next station. In the Métro, you have to open the \ndoors yourself by pushing a button, or depressing a lever, or slid-\ning them (depending upon which kind of car you happen to be \non). In some transit systems, the passenger is supposed to operate \n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback 135\nthe door, but in others this is forbidden. The frequent traveler is \ncontinually confronted with this kind of situation: the behavior \nthat is appropriate in one place is inappropriate in another, even \nin situations that appear to be identical. Known cultural norms \ncan create comfort and harmony. Unknown norms can lead to dis-\ncomfort and confusion.\nTHE PROBLEM WITH SWITCHES\nWhen I give talks, quite often my first demonstration needs no \npreparation. I can count on the light switches of the room or au-\nditorium to be unmanageable. “Lights, please,” someone will say. \nThen fumble, fumble, fumble. Who knows where the switches are \nand which lights they control? The lights seem to work smoothly \nonly when a technician is hired to sit in a control room somewhere, \nturning them on and off.\nThe switch problems in an auditorium are annoying, but similar \nproblems in industry could be dangerous. In many control rooms, \nrow upon row of identical-looking switches confront the operators. \nHow do they avoid the occasional error, confusion, or accidental \nbumping against the wrong control? Or mis-aim? They don’t. For-\ntunately, industrial settings are usually pretty robust. A few errors \nevery now and then are not important—usually.\nOne type of popular small airplane has identical-looking switches \nfor flaps and for landing gear, right next to one another. You might \nbe  surprised to learn how many pilots, while on the ground, have \ndecided to raise the flaps and instead raised the wheels. This very \nexpensive error happened frequently enough that the National \nTransportation Safety Board wrote a report about it. The analysts \npolitely pointed out that the proper design principles to avoid these \nerrors had been known for fifty years. Why were these design \nerrors still being made?\nBasic switches and controls should be relatively simple to de-\nsign well. But there are two fundamental difficulties. The first is \nto determine what type of device they control; for example, flaps \nor landing gear. The second is the mapping problem, discussed \nextensively in Chapters 1 and 3; for example, when there are many \n\n\n136 The Design of Everyday Things\nlights and an array of switches, which switch controls which light?\nThe switch problem becomes serious only where there are many \nof them. It isn’t a problem in situations with one switch, and it is \nonly a minor problem where there are two switches. But the dif-\nficulties mount rapidly with more than two switches at the same \nlocation. Multiple switches are more likely to appear in offices, au-\nditoriums, and industrial locations than in homes. \nWith complex installations, where there are numerous lights and \nswitches, the light controls seldom fit the needs of the situation. \nWhen I give talks, I need a way to dim the light hitting the pro-\njection screen so that images are visible, but keep enough light on \nthe audience so that they can take notes (and I can monitor their \nreaction to the talk). This kind of control is seldom provided. Elec-\ntricians are not trained to do task analyses.\nWhose fault is this? Probably nobody’s. Blaming a person is sel-\ndom appropriate or useful, a point I return to in Chapter 5. The \nproblem is probably due to the difficulties of coordinating the dif-\nferent professions involved in installing light controls.\nFIGURE 4.4. Incomprehensible Light Switches. Banks of switches like this are not \nuncommon in homes. There is no obvious mapping between the switches and the \nlights being controlled. I once had a similar panel in my home, although with only \nsix switches. Even after years of living in the house, I could never remember which to \nuse, so I simply put all the switches either up (on) or down (off). How did I solve the \nproblem? See Figure 4.5.\n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback 137\nI once lived in a wonderful house on the cliffs of Del Mar, Cal-\nifornia, designed for us by two young, award-winning architects. \nThe house was wonderful, and the architects proved their worth \nby the spectacular placement of the house and the broad windows \nthat overlooked the ocean. But they liked spare, neat, modern design \nto a fault. Inside the house were, among other things, neat rows of \nlight switches: A horizontal row of four identical switches in the \nfront hall, a vertical column of six identical switches in the living \nroom. “You will get used to it,” the architects assured us when \nwe complained. We never did. Figure 4.4 shows an eight-switch \nbank that I found in a home I was visiting. Who could remember \nwhat each does? My home only had six switches, and that was bad \nenough. (Photographs of the switch plate from my Del Mar home \nare no longer available.)\nThe lack of clear communication among the people and organi-\nzations constructing parts of a system is perhaps the most common \ncause of complicated, confusing designs. A usable design starts \nwith careful observations of how the tasks being supported are \nactually performed, followed by a design process that results in a \ngood fit to the actual ways the tasks get performed. The technical \nname for this method is task analysis. The name for the entire pro-\ncess is human-centered design (HCD), discussed in Chapter 6.\nThe solutions to the problem posed by my Del Mar home require \nthe natural mappings described in Chapter 3. With six light switches \nmounted in a one-dimensional array, vertically on the wall, there is \nno way they can map naturally to the two-dimensional, horizontal \nplacement of the lights in the ceiling. Why place the switches flat \nagainst the wall? Why not redo things? Why not place the switches \nhorizontally, in exact analogy to the things being controlled, with \na two-dimensional layout so that the switches can be placed on a \nfloor plan of the building in exact correspondence to the areas that \nthey control? Match the layout of the lights with the layout of the \nswitches: the principle of natural mapping. You can see the result \nin Figure 4.5. We mounted a floor plan of the living room on a plate \nand oriented it to match the room. Switches were placed on the \nfloor plan so that each switch was located in the area controlled \n\n\n138 The Design of Everyday Things\nby that switch. The plate was mounted with a slight tilt from the \nhorizontal to make it easy to see and to make the mapping clear: \nhad the plate been vertical, the mapping would still be ambiguous. \nThe plate was tilted rather than horizontal to discourage people \n(us or visitors) from placing objects, such as cups, on the plate: an \nexample of an anti-affordance. (We further simplified operations \nby moving the sixth switch to a different location where its mean-\ning was clear and it did not confuse, because it stood alone.)\nIt is unnecessarily difficult to implement this spatial mapping \nof switches to lights: the required parts are not available. I had to \nhire a skilled technician to construct the wall-mounted box and \ninstall the special switches and control equipment. Builders and \nelectricians need standardized components. Today, the switch \nboxes that are available to electricians are organized as rectangu-\nlar boxes meant to hold a long, linear string of switches and to \nbe mounted horizontally or vertically on the wall. To produce the \nappropriate spatial array, we would need a two-dimensional struc-\nture that could be mounted parallel to the floor, where the switches \nwould be mounted on the top of the box, on the horizontal surface. \nThe switch box should have a matrix of supports so that there can \nbe free, relatively unrestricted placement of the switches in what-\never pattern best suits the room. Ideally the box would use small \nswitches, perhaps low-voltage switches that would control a sepa-\nrately mounted control structure that takes care of the lights (which \nis what I did in my home). Switches and lights could communicate \n FIGURE 4.5. A Natural Mapping of Light \nSwitches to Lights. This is how I mapped \nfive switches to the lights in my living \nroom. I placed small toggle switches that \nfit onto a plan of the home’s living room, \nbalcony, and hall, with each switch placed \nwhere the light was located. The X by the \ncenter switch indicates where this panel \nwas located. The surface was tilted to make \nit easier to relate it to the horizontal ar-\nrangement of the lights, and the slope pro-\nvided a natural anti-affordance, preventing \npeople from putting coffee cups and drink \ncontainers on the controls.\n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback 139\nwirelessly instead of through the traditional home wiring cables. \nInstead of the standardized light plates for today’s large, bulky \nswitches, the plates should be designed for small holes appropri-\nate to the small switches, combined with a way of inserting a floor \nplan on to the switch cover.\nMy suggestion requires that the switch box stick out from the \nwall, whereas today’s boxes are mounted so that the switches are \nflush with the wall. But these new switch boxes wouldn’t have to \nstick out. They could be placed in indented openings in the walls: \njust as there is room inside the wall for the existing switch boxes, \nthere is also room for an indented horizontal surface. Or the \nswitches could be mounted on a little pedestal.\nAs a side note, in the decades that have passed since the first edi-\ntion of this book was published, the section on natural mappings \nand the difficulties with light switches has received a very popular \nreception. Nonetheless, there are no commercial tools available \nto make it easy to implement these ideas in the home. I once tried \nto convince the CEO of the company whose smart home devices I \nhad used to implement the controls of Figure 4.5, to use the idea. \n“Why not manufacture the components to make it easy for people \nto do this,” I suggested. I failed.\nSomeday, we will get rid of the hard-wired switches, which re-\nquire excessive runs of electrical cable, add to the cost and diffi-\nculties of home construction, and make remodeling of electrical \ncircuits extremely difficult and time consuming. Instead, we will \nuse Internet or wireless signals to connect switches to the devices \nto be controlled. In this way, controls could be located anywhere. \nThey could be reconfigured or moved. We could have multiple con-\ntrols for the same item, some in our phones or other portable de-\nvices. I can control my home thermostat from anywhere in the \nworld: why can’t I do the same with my lights? Some of the nec-\nessary technology does exist today in specialty shops and custom \nbuilders, but they will not come into widespread usage until ma-\njor manufacturers make the necessary components and traditional \nelectricians become comfortable with installing them. The tools for \ncreating switch configurations that use good mapping principles \n\n\n140 The Design of Everyday Things\ncould become standard and easy to apply. It will happen, but it \nmay take considerable time.\nAlas, like many things that change, new technologies will \nbring virtues and deficits. The controls are apt to be through \ntouch-sensitive screens, allowing excellent natural mapping to the \nspatial layouts involved, but lacking the physical affordances of \nphysical switches. They can’t be operated with the side of the arm \nor the elbow while trying to enter a room, hands loaded with pack-\nages or cups of coffee. Touch screens are fine if the hands are free. \nPerhaps cameras that recognize gestures will do the job.\nACTIVITY-CENTERED CONTROLS\nSpatial mapping of switches is not always appropriate. In many \ncases it is better to have switches that control activities: activity-\ncentered control. Many auditoriums in schools and companies \nhave computer-based controls, with switches labeled with such \nphrases as “video,” “computer,” “full lights,” and “lecture.” When \ncarefully designed, with a good, detailed analysis of the activi-\nties to be supported, the mapping of controls to activities works \nextremely well: video requires a dark auditorium plus control of \nsound level and controls to start, pause, and stop the presentation. \nProjected images require a dark screen area with enough light in \nthe auditorium so people can take notes. Lectures require some \nstage lights so the speaker can be seen. Activity-based controls are \nexcellent in theory, but the practice is difficult to get right. When it \nis done badly, it creates difficulties.\nA related but wrong approach is to be device-centered rather \nthan activity-centered. When they are device-centered, different \ncontrol screens cover lights, sound, computer, and video projec-\ntion. This requires the lecturer to go to one screen to adjust the \nlight, a different screen to adjust sound levels, and yet a different \nscreen to advance or control the images. It is a horrible cognitive \ninterruption to the flow of the talk to go back and forth among the \nscreens, perhaps to pause the video in order to make a comment \nor answer a question. Activity-centered controls anticipate this need \nand put light, sound level, and projection controls all in one location.\n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback \n141\nI once used an activity-centered control, setting it to present my \nphotographs to the audience. All worked well until I was asked a \nquestion. I paused to answer it, but wanted to raise the room lights \nso I could see the audience. No, the activity of giving a talk with \nvisually presented images meant that room lights were fixed at a \ndim setting. When I tried to increase the light intensity, this took \nme out of “giving a talk” activity, so I did get the light to where I \nwanted it, but the projection screen also went up into the ceiling \nand the projector was turned off. The difficulty with activity-based \ncontrollers is handling the exceptional cases, the ones not thought \nabout during design.\nActivity-centered controls are the proper way to go, if the ac-\ntivities are carefully selected to match actual requirements. But \neven in these cases, manual controls will still be required because \nthere will always be some new, unexpected demand that requires \nidiosyncratic settings. As my example demonstrates, invoking \nthe manual settings should not cause the current activity to be \ncanceled.\nConstraints That Force the Desired Behavior\nFORCING FUNCTIONS\nForcing functions are a form of physical constraint: situations in \nwhich the actions are constrained so that failure at one stage pre-\nvents the next step from happening. Starting a car has a forcing \nfunction associated with it—the driver must have some physical \nobject that signifies permission to use the car. In the past, it was a \nphysical key to unlock the car doors and also to be placed into the \nignition switch, which allowed the key to turn on the electrical sys-\ntem and, if rotated to its extreme position, to activate the engine.\nToday’s cars have many means of verifying permission. Some still \nrequire a key, but it can stay in one’s pocket or carrying case. More \nand more, the key is not required and is replaced by a card, phone, \nor some physical token that can communicate with the car. As long \nas only authorized people have the card (which is, of course, the \nsame for keys), everything works fine. Electric or hybrid vehicles \n",

Because the vehicle \nwon’t start without the authentication proved by possession of the \nkey, it is a forcing function.\nForcing functions are the extreme case of strong constraints that \ncan prevent inappropriate behavior. Not every situation allows \nsuch strong constraints to operate, but the general principle can be \nextended to a wide variety of situations. In the field of safety engi-\nneering, forcing functions show up under other names, in partic-\nular as specialized methods for the prevention of accidents. Three \nsuch methods are interlocks, lock-ins, and lockouts.\nINTERLOCKS\nAn interlock forces operations to take place in proper sequence. \nMicrowave ovens and devices with interior exposure to high volt-\nage use interlocks as forcing functions to prevent people from \nopening the door of the oven or disassembling the devices without \nfirst turning off the electric power: the interlock disconnects the \npower the instant the door is opened or the back is removed. In \nautomobiles with automatic transmissions, an interlock prevents \nthe transmission from leaving the Park position unless the car’s \nbrake pedal is depressed.\nAnother form of interlock is the “dead man’s switch” in nu-\nmerous safety settings, especially for the operators of trains, lawn \nmowers, chainsaws, and many recreational vehicles. In Britain, \nthese are called the “driver’s safety device.” Many require that the \noperator hold down a spring-loaded switch to enable operation of \nthe equipment, so that if the operator dies (or loses control), the \nswitch will be released, stopping the equipment. Because some op-\nerators bypassed the feature by tying down the control (or placing \na heavy weight on foot-operated ones), various schemes have been \ndeveloped to determine that the person is really alive and alert. \nSome require a midlevel of pressure; some, repeated depressions \nand releases. Some require responses to queries. But in all cases, \n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback 143\nthey are examples of safety-related interlocks to prevent operation \nwhen the operator is incapacitated.\nLOCK-INS\nA lock-in keeps an operation active, preventing someone from pre-\nmaturely stopping it. Standard lock-ins exist on many computer \napplications, where any attempt to exit the application without \nsaving work is prevented by a message prompt asking whether \nthat is what is really wanted (Figure 4. 6). These are so effective that \nI use them deliberately as my standard way of exiting. Rather than \nsaving a file and then exiting the program, I simply exit, knowing \nthat I will be given a simple way to save my work. What was once \ncreated as an error message has become an efficient shortcut.\nLock-ins can be quite literal, as in jail cells or playpens for babies, \npreventing a person from leaving the area.\nSome companies try to lock in customers by making all their \nproducts work harmoniously with one another but be incompati-\nble with the products of their competition. Thus music, videos, or \nelectronic books purchased from one company may be played or \nread on music and video players and e-book readers made by that \ncompany, but will fail with similar devices from other manufactur-\ners. The goal is to use design as a business strategy: the consistency \nwithin a given manufacturer means once people learn the system, \nthey will stay with it and hesitate to change. The confusion when \nusing a different company’s system further prevents customers from \n FIGURE 4.6 A Lock-In Forcing Function. This lock-in makes it difficult \nto exit a program without either saving the work or consciously saying \nnot to. Notice that it is politely configured so that the desired operation \ncan be taken right from the message.\n\n\n144 The Design of Everyday Things\nchanging systems. In the end, the people who must use multiple \nsystems lose. Actually, everyone loses, except for the one manufac-\nturer whose products dominate.\nLOCKOUTS\nWhereas a lock-in keeps someone in a space or prevents an action \nuntil the desired operations have been done, a lockout prevents \nsomeone from entering a space that is dangerous, or prevents an \nevent from occurring. A good example of a lockout is found in \nstairways of public buildings, at least in the United States (Figure \n4.7). In cases of fire, people have a tendency to flee in panic, down \nthe stairs, down, down, down, past the ground floor and into the \nbasement, where they might be trapped. The solution (required by \nthe fire laws) is not to allow simple passage from the ground floor \nto the basement.\nLockouts are usually used for safety reasons. Thus, small chil-\ndren are protected by baby locks on cabinet doors, covers for elec-\ntric outlets, and specialized caps on containers for drugs and toxic \nsubstances. The pin that prevents a fire extinguisher from being \nactivated until it is removed is a lockout forcing function to pre-\nvent accidental discharge.\n FIGURE 4.7. A Lockout Forcing Function for Fire Exit. \nThe gate, placed at the ground floor of stairways, prevents \npeople who might be rushing down the stairs to escape a \nfire from continuing into the basement areas, where they \nmight get trapped.\n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback 145\nForcing functions can be a nuisance in normal usage. The result \nis that many people will deliberately disable the forcing func-\ntion, thereby negating its safety feature. The clever designer has \nto minimize the nuisance value while retaining the safety feature \nof the forcing function that guards against the occasional tragedy. \nThe gate in Figure 4.7 is a clever compromise: sufficient restraint \nto make people realize they are leaving the ground floor, but not \nenough of an impediment to normal behavior that people will \nprop open the gate.\nOther useful devices make use of a forcing function. In some \npublic restrooms, a pull-down shelf is placed inconveniently on \nthe wall just behind the cubicle door, held in a vertical position by \na spring. You lower the shelf to the horizontal position, and the \nweight of a package or handbag keeps it there. The shelf’s position \nis a forcing function. When the shelf is lowered, it blocks the door \nfully. So to get out of the cubicle, you have to remove whatever is \non the shelf and raise it out of the way. Clever design.\nConventions, Constraints, and Affordances\nIn Chapter 1 we learned of the distinctions between affordances, \nperceived affordances, and signifiers. Affordances refer to the po-\ntential actions that are possible, but these are easily discoverable \nonly if they are perceivable: perceived affordances. It is the sig-\nnifier component of the perceived affordance that allows people \nto determine the possible actions. But how does one go from the \nperception of an affordance to understanding the potential action? \nIn many cases, through conventions.\nA doorknob has the perceived affordance of graspability. But \nknowing that it is the doorknob that is used to open and close \ndoors is learned: it is a cultural aspect of the design that knobs, \nhandles, and bars, when placed on doors, are intended to enable \nthe opening and shutting of those doors. The same devices on \nfixed walls would have a different interpretation: they might offer \nsupport, for example, but certainly not the possibility of opening \nthe wall. The interpretation of a perceived affordance is a cultural \nconvention.\n\n\n146 The Design of Everyday Things\nCONVENTIONS ARE CULTURAL CONSTRAINTS\nConventions are a special kind of cultural constraint. For exam-\nple, the means by which people eat is subject to strong cultural \nconstraints and conventions. Different cultures use different eat-\ning utensils. Some eat primarily with the fingers and bread. Some \nuse elaborate serving devices. The same is true of almost every \naspect of behavior imaginable, from the clothes that are worn; \nto the way one addresses elders, equals, and inferiors; and even \nto the order in which people enter or exit a room. What is consid-\nered correct and proper in one culture may be considered impo-\nlite in another.\nAlthough conventions provide valuable guidance for novel sit-\nuations, their existence can make it difficult to enact change: con-\nsider the story of destination-control elevators.\nWHEN CONVENTIONS CHANGE: \nTHE CASE OF DESTINATION-CONTROL ELEVATORS\nOperating the common elevator seems like a no-brainer. Press the but-\nton, get in the box, go up or down, get out. But we’ve been encountering \nand documenting an array of curious design variations on this simple \ninteraction, raising the question: Why? (From Portigal & Norvaisas, 2011.)\nThis quotation comes from two design professionals who were \nso offended by a change in the controls for an elevator system that \nthey wrote an entire article of complaint.\nWhat could possibly cause such an offense? Was it really bad de-\nsign or, as the authors suggest, a completely unnecessary change to \nan otherwise satisfactory system? Here is what happened: the au-\nthors had encountered a new convention for elevators called “Ele-\nvator Destination Control.” Many people (including me) consider \nit superior to the one we are all used to. Its major disadvantage is \nthat it is different. It violates customary convention. Violations of \nconvention can be very disturbing. Here is the history.\nWhen “modern” elevators were first installed in buildings in \nthe late 1800s, they always had a human operator who controlled \nthe speed and direction of the elevator, stopped at the appropri-\n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback \n147\nate floors, and opened and shut the doors. People would enter the \nelevator, greet the operator, and state which floor they wished to \ntravel to. When the elevators became automated, a similar con-\nvention was followed. People entered the elevator and told the \nelevator what floor they were traveling to by pushing the appro-\npriately marked button inside the elevator.\nThis is a pretty inefficient way of doing things. Most of you have \nprobably experienced a crowded elevator where every person \nseems to want to go to a different floor, which means a slow trip for \nthe people going to the higher floors. A destination-control eleva-\ntor system groups passengers, so that those going to the same floor \nare asked to use the same elevator and the passenger load is dis-\ntributed to maximize efficiency. Although this kind of grouping \nis only sensible for buildings that have a large number of elevators, \nthat would cover any large hotel, office, or apartment building.\nIn the traditional elevator, passengers stand in the elevator hall-\nway and indicate whether they wish to travel up or down. When an \nelevator arrives going in the appropriate direction, they get in and \nuse the keypad inside the elevator to indicate their destination \nfloor. As a result, five people might get into the same elevator each \nwanting a different floor. With destination control, the destination \nkeypads are located in the hallway outside the elevators and there \nare no keypads inside the elevators (Figure 4.8A and D). People \nare directed to whichever elevator will most efficiently reach their \nfloor. Thus, if there were five people desiring elevators, they might \nbe assigned to five different elevators. The result is faster trips for \neveryone, with a minimum of stops. Even if people are assigned to \nelevators that are not the next to arrive, they will get to their desti-\nnations faster than if they took earlier elevators. \nDestination control was invented in 1985, but the first commer-\ncial installation didn’t appear until 1990 (in Schindler elevators). \nNow, decades later, it is starting to appear more frequently as de-\nvelopers of tall buildings discover that destination control yields \nbetter service to passengers, or equal service with fewer elevators.\nHorrors! As Figure 4.8D confirms, there are no controls inside the \nelevator to specify a floor. What if passengers change their minds \n\n\n148 The Design of Everyday Things\n FIGURE 4.8. Destination-Control Elevators. In a destination-\ncontrol system, the desired destination floor is entered into the control \npanel outside the elevators (A and B). After entering the destination \nfloor into B, the display directs the traveler to the appropriate elevator, \nas shown in C, where “32” has been entered as the desired floor destina-\ntion, and the person is directed to elevator “L” (the first elevator on the \nleft, in A). There is no way to specify the floor from inside the elevator: \nInside, the controls are only to open and shut the doors and an alarm (D). \nThis is a much more efficient design, but confusing to people used to the \nmore conventional system.

(Even my editor at Basic \nBooks complained about this in a marginal note.) What then? What \ndo you do in a regular elevator when you decide you really want \nto get off at the sixth floor just as the elevator passes the seventh \nfloor? It’s simple: just get off at the next stop and go to the destina-\ntion control box in the elevator hall, and specify the intended floor.\nPEOPLE’S RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN CONVENTIONS\nPeople invariably object and complain whenever a new approach \nis introduced into an existing array of products and systems. Con-\nventions are violated: new learning is required. The merits of the \nnew system are irrelevant: it is the change that is upsetting. The \ndestination control elevator is only one of many such examples. \nThe metric system provides a powerful example of the difficulties \nin changing people’s conventions. \nThe metric scale of measurement is superior to the English scale \nof units in almost every dimension: it is logical, easy to learn, \nand easy to use in computations. Today, over two centuries have \npassed since the metric system was developed by the French in \nthe 1790s, yet three countries still resist its use: the United States, \nLiberia, and Myanmar. Even Great Britain has mostly switched, so \nthe only major country left that uses the older English system of \nunits is the United States. Why haven’t we switched? The change \nis too upsetting for the people who have to learn the new system, \nand the initial cost of purchasing new tools and measuring devices \nseems excessive. The learning difficulties are nowhere as complex \nas purported, and the cost would be relatively small because the \nmetric system is already in wide use, even in the United States.\nConsistency in design is virtuous. It means that lessons learned \nwith one system transfer readily to others. On the whole, consis-\ntency is to be followed. If a new way of doing things is only slightly \nbetter than the old, it is better to be consistent. But if there is to be \na change, everybody has to change. Mixed systems are confusing \nto everyone. When a new way of doing things is vastly superior \nto another, then the merits of change outweigh the difficulty of \n\n\n150 The Design of Everyday Things\nchange. Just because something is different does not mean it is bad. \nIf we only kept to the old, we could never improve.\nThe Faucet: \nA Case History of Design\nIt may be hard to believe that an everyday water faucet could need \nan instruction manual. I saw one, this time at the meeting of the \nBritish Psychological Society in Sheffield, England. The partici-\npants were lodged in dormitories. Upon checking into Ranmoor \nHouse, each guest was given a pamphlet that provided useful infor-\nmation: where the churches were, the times of meals, the location of \nthe post office, and how to work the taps (faucets). “The taps on the \nwashhand basin are operated by pushing down gently.”\nWhen it was my turn to speak at the conference, I asked the audi-\nence about those taps. How many had trouble using them? Polite, \nrestrained tittering from the audience. How many tried to turn the \nhandle? A large show of hands. How many had to seek help? A few \nhonest folks raised their hands. Afterward, one woman came up to \nme and said that she had given up and walked the halls until she \nfound someone who could explain the taps to her. A simple sink, a \nsimple-looking faucet. But it looks as if it should be turned, not \npushed. If you want the faucet to be pushed, make it look as if it \nshould be pushed. (This, of course, is similar to the problem I had \nemptying the water from the sink in my hotel, described in Chapter 1.)\nWhy is such a simple, standard item as a water faucet so diffi-\ncult to get right? The person using a faucet cares about two things: \nwater temperature and rate of flow. But water enters the faucet \nthrough two pipes, hot and cold. There is a conflict between the \nhuman need for temperature and flow and the physical structure \nof hot and cold.\nThere are several ways to deal with this:\n•  Control both hot and cold water: Two controls, one for hot water, \nthe other cold.\n•  Control only temperature: One control, where rate of flow is fixed. \nRotating the control from its fixed position turns on the water at \n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback \n151\nsome predetermined rate of flow, with the temperature controlled by \nthe knob position.\n•  Control only amount: One control, where temperature is fixed, with \nrate of flow controlled by the knob position.\n•  On-off. One control turns the water on and off. This is how gesture-\ncontrolled faucets work: moving the hand under or away from \nthe spout turns the water on or off, at a fixed temperature and rate \nof flow.\n•  Control temperature and rate of flow. Use two separate controls, one \nfor water temperature, the other for flow rate. (I have never encoun-\ntered this solution.)\n•  One control for temperature and rate: Have one integrated con-\ntrol, where movement in one direction controls the temperature and \nmovement in a different direction controls the amount.\nWhere there are two controls, one for hot water and one for cold, \nthere are four mapping problems;\n•  Which knob controls the hot, which the cold?\n•  How do you change the temperature without affecting the rate of \nflow?\n•  How do you change the flow without affecting the temperature?\n•  Which direction increases water flow?\nThe mapping problems are solved through cultural conventions, \nor constraints. It is a worldwide convention that the left faucet \nshould be hot; the right, cold. It is also a universal convention that \nscrew threads are made to tighten with clockwise turning, loosen \nwith counterclockwise. You turn off a faucet by tightening a screw \nthread (tightening a washer against its seat), thereby shutting off \nthe flow of water. So clockwise turning shuts off the water, counter-\nclockwise turns it on.\nUnfortunately, the constraints do not always hold. Most of \nthe English people I asked were not aware that left/hot, right/\ncold was a convention; it is violated too often to be considered a \nconvention in England. But the convention isn’t universal in the \n",

I once experienced shower controls that were \nplaced vertically: Which one controlled the hot water, the top fau-\ncet or the bottom?\nIf the two faucet handles are round knobs, clockwise rotation \nof either should decrease volume. However, if each faucet has a \nsingle “blade” as its handle, then people don’t think they are ro-\ntating the handles: they think that they are pushing or pulling. To \nmaintain consistency, pulling either faucet should increase volume, \neven though this means rotating the left faucet counterclockwise \nand the right one clockwise. Although rotation direction is incon-\nsistent, pulling and pushing is consistent, which is how people \nconceptualize their actions.\nAlas, sometimes clever people are too clever for our good. Some \nwell-meaning plumbing designers have decided that consistency \nshould be ignored in favor of their own, private brand of psy-\nchology. The human body has mirror-image symmetry, say these \npseudo-psychologists. So if the left hand moves clockwise, why, \nthe right hand should move counterclockwise. Watch out, your \nplumber or architect may install a bathroom fixture whose clock-\nwise rotation has a different result with the hot water than with \nthe cold.\nAs you try to control the water temperature, soap running down \nover your eyes, groping to change the water control with one hand, \nsoap or shampoo clutched in the other, you are guaranteed to get it \nwrong. If the water is too cold, the groping hand is just as likely to \nmake the water colder as to make it scalding hot. \nWhoever invented that mirror-image nonsense should be forced \nto take a shower. Yes, there is some logic to it. To be a bit fair to \nthe inventor of the scheme, it works as long as you always use \ntwo hands to adjust both faucets simultaneously. It fails misera-\nbly, however, when one hand is used to alternate between the two \ncontrols. Then you cannot remember which direction does what. \nOnce again, notice that this can be corrected without replacing the \nindividual faucets: just replace the handles with blades. It is psy-\nchological perceptions that matter—the conceptual model—not \nphysical consistency. \n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback 153\nThe operation of faucets needs to be standardized so that the \npsychological conceptual model of operation is the same for all \ntypes of faucets. With the traditional dual faucet controls for hot \nand cold water, the standards should state:\n•  When the handles are round, both should rotate in the same direction \nto change water volume.\n•  When the handles are single blades, both should be pulled to change \nwater volume (which means rotating in opposite directions in the \nfaucet itself).\nOther configurations of handles are possible. Suppose the han-\ndles are mounted on a horizontal axis so that they rotate vertically. \nThen what? Would the answer differ for single blade handles and \nround ones? I leave this as an exercise for the reader.\nWhat about the evaluation problem? Feedback in the use of most \nfaucets is rapid and direct, so turning them the wrong way is easy \nto discover and correct. The evaluate-action cycle is easy to traverse. \nAs a result, the discrepancy from normal rules is often not noticed—\nunless you are in the shower and the feedback occurs when you \nscald or freeze yourself. When the faucets are far removed from the \nspout, as is the case where the faucets are located in the center of \nthe bathtub but the spouts high on an end wall, the delay between \nturning the faucets and the change in temperature can be quite long: \nI once timed a shower control to take 5 seconds. This makes setting \nthe temperature rather difficult. Turn the faucet the wrong way and \nthen dance around inside the shower while the water is scalding \nhot or freezing cold, madly turning the faucet in what you hope is \nthe correct direction, hoping the temperature will stabilize quickly. \nHere the problem comes from the properties of fluid flow—it takes \ntime for water to travel the 2 meters or so of pipe that might con-\nnect the faucets with the spout—so it is not easily remedied. But \nthe problem is exacerbated by poor design of the controls.\nNow let’s turn to the modern single-spout, single-control fau-\ncet. Technology to the rescue. Move the control one way, it ad-\njusts temperature. Move it another, it adjusts volume. Hurrah! \n\n\n154 The Design of Everyday Things\nWe control exactly the variables of interest, and the mixing spout \nsolves the evaluation problem.\nYes, these new faucets are beautiful. Sleek, elegant, prize win-\nning. Unusable. They solved one set of problems only to create yet \nanother. The mapping problems now predominate. The difficulty \nlies in a lack of standardization of the dimensions of control, and \nthen, which direction of movement means what? Sometimes there \nis a knob that can be pushed or pulled, rotated clockwise or coun-\nterclockwise. But does the push or pull control volume or tempera-\nture? Is a pull more volume or less, hotter temperature or cooler? \nSometimes there is a lever that moves side to side or forward and \nbackward. Once again, which movement is volume, which tem-\nperature? And even then, which way is more (or hotter), which is \nless (or cooler)? The perceptually simple one-control faucet still has \nfour mapping problems:\n• What dimension of control affects the temperature?\n• Which direction along that dimension means hotter?\n• What dimension of control affects the rate of flow?\n• Which direction along that dimension means more?\nIn the name of elegance, the moving parts sometimes meld in-\nvisibly into the faucet structure, making it nearly impossible even \nto find the controls, let alone figure out which way they move or \nwhat they control. And then, different faucet designs use different \nsolutions. One-control faucets ought to be superior because they \ncontrol the psychological variables of interest. But because of the \nlack of standardization and awkward design (to call it “awkward” \nis being kind), they frustrate many people so much that they tend \nto be disliked more than they are admired. \nBath and kitchen faucet design ought to be simple, but can vio-\nlate many design principles, including:\n• Visible affordances and signifiers\n• Discoverability\n• Immediacy of feedback\n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback 155\nFinally, many violate the principle of desperation:\n• If all else fails, standardize.\nStandardization is indeed the fundamental principle of desper-\nation: when no other solution appears possible, simply design ev-\nerything the same way, so people only have to learn once. If all \nmakers of faucets could agree on a standard set of motions to con-\ntrol amount and temperature (how about up and down to control \namount—up meaning increase—and left and right to control tem-\nperature, left meaning hot?), then we could all learn the standards \nonce, and forever afterward use the knowledge for every new fau-\ncet we encountered.\nIf you can’t put the knowledge on the device (that is, knowledge \nin the world), then develop a cultural constraint: standardize what \nhas to be kept in the head. And remember the lesson from faucet \nrotation on page 153: The standards should reflect the psychologi-\ncal conceptual models, not the physical mechanics.\nStandards simplify life for everyone. At the same time, they \ntend to hinder future development. And, as discussed in Chapter \n6, there are often difficult political struggles in finding common \nagreement. Nonetheless, when all else fails, standards are the way \nto proceed.\nUsing Sound as Signifiers\nSometimes everything that is needed cannot be made visible. Enter \nsound: sound can provide information available in no other way. \nSound can tell us that things are working properly or that they \nneed maintenance or repair. It can even save us from accidents. \nConsider the information provided by:\n• The click when the bolt on a door slides home\n• The tinny sound when a door doesn’t shut right\n• The roaring sound when a car muffler gets a hole\n• The rattle when things aren’t secured\n• The whistle of a teakettle when the water boils\n\n\n156 The Design of Everyday Things\n• The click when the toast pops up\n• The increase in pitch when a vacuum cleaner gets clogged\n•  The indescribable change in sound when a complex piece of machin-\nery starts to have problems\nMany devices simply beep and burp. These are not natural-\nistic sounds; they do not convey hidden information. When \nused properly, a beep can assure you that you’ve pressed a \nbutton, but the sound is as annoying as informative. Sounds \nshould be generated so as to give knowledge about the source. \nThey should convey something about the actions that are tak-\ning place, actions that matter to the user but that would other-\nwise not be visible. The buzzes, clicks, and hums that you hear \nwhile a telephone call is being completed are one good example: \ntake out those noises and you are less certain that the connec-\ntion is being made.\nReal, natural sound is as essential as visual information because \nsound tells us about things we can’t see, and it does so while our \neyes are occupied elsewhere. Natural sounds reflect the complex \ninteraction of natural objects: the way one part moves against an-\nother; the material of which the parts are made—hollow or solid, \nmetal or wood, soft or hard, rough or smooth. Sounds are gener-\nated when materials interact, and the sound tells us whether they \nare hitting, sliding, breaking, tearing, crumbling, or bouncing. Ex-\nperienced mechanics can diagnosis the condition of machinery just \nby listening. When sounds are generated artificially, if intelligently \ncreated using a rich auditory spectrum, with care to provide the \nsubtle cues that are informative without being annoying, they can \nbe as useful as sounds in the real world.\nSound is tricky. It can annoy and distract as easily as it can aid. \nSounds that at one’s first encounter are pleasant or cute easily be-\ncome annoying rather than useful. One of the virtues of sounds \nis that they can be detected even when attention is applied else-\nwhere. But this virtue is also a deficit, for sounds are often intru-\nsive. Sounds are difficult to keep private unless the intensity is low \nor earphones are used. This means both that neighbors may be \n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback \n157\nannoyed and that others can monitor your activities. The use of \nsound to convey knowledge is a powerful and important idea, but \nstill in its infancy.\nJust as the presence of sound can serve a useful role in providing \nfeedback about events, the absence of sound can lead to the same \nkinds of difficulties we have already encountered from a lack of \nfeedback. The absence of sound can mean an absence of knowl-\nedge, and if feedback from an action is expected to come from \nsound, silence can lead to problems.\nWHEN SILENCE KILLS\nIt was a pleasant June day in Munich, Germany. I was picked up at \nmy hotel and driven to the country with farmland on either side of \nthe narrow, two-lane road. Occasional walkers strode by, and every \nso often a bicyclist passed. We parked the car on the shoulder of \nthe road and joined a group of people looking up and down the \nroad. “Okay, get ready,” I was told. “Close your eyes and listen.” \nI did so and about a minute later I heard a high-pitched whine, \naccompanied by a low humming sound: an automobile was ap-\nproaching. As it came closer, I could hear tire noise. After the car \nhad passed, I was asked my judgment of the sound. We repeated \nthe exercise numerous times, and each time the sound was differ-\nent. What was going on? We were evaluating sound designs for \nBMW’s new electric vehicles.\nElectric cars are extremely quiet. The only sounds they make \ncome from the tires, the air, and occasionally, from the high-pitched \nwhine of the electronics. Car lovers really like the silence. Pedestri-\nans have mixed feelings, but the blind are greatly concerned. After \nall, the blind cross streets in traffic by relying upon the sounds of \nvehicles. That’s how they know when it is safe to cross. And what \nis true for the blind might also be true for anyone stepping onto \nthe street while distracted. If the vehicles don’t make any sounds, \nthey can kill. The United States National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration determined that pedestrians are considerably \nmore likely to be hit by hybrid or electric vehicles than by those \nthat have an internal combustion engine. The greatest danger is \n\n\n158 The Design of Everyday Things\nwhen the hybrid or electric vehicles are moving slowly, when they \nare almost completely silent. The sounds of an automobile are im-\nportant signifiers of its presence.\nAdding sound to a vehicle to warn pedestrians is not a new idea. \nFor many years, commercial trucks and construction equipment \nhave had to make beeping sounds when backing up. Horns are \nrequired by law, presumably so that drivers can use them to alert \npedestrians and other drivers when the need arises, although they \nare often used as a way of venting anger and rage instead. But \nadding a continuous sound to a normal vehicle because it would \notherwise be too quiet, is a challenge.\nWhat sound would you want? One group of blind people sug-\ngested putting some rocks into the hubcaps. I thought this was \nbrilliant. The rocks would provide a natural set of cues, rich in \nmeaning yet easy to interpret. The car would be quiet until the \nwheels started to turn. Then, the rocks would make natural, contin-\nuous scraping sounds at low speeds, change to the pitter-patter of \nfalling stones at higher speeds, the frequency of the drops increas-\ning with the speed of the car until the car was moving fast enough \nthat the rocks would be frozen against the circumference of the rim, \nsilent. Which is fine: the sounds are not needed for fast-moving \nvehicles because then the tire noise is audible. The lack of sound \nwhen the vehicle was not moving would be a problem, however.\nThe marketing divisions of automobile manufacturers thought \nthat the addition of artificial sounds would be a wonderful brand-\ning opportunity, so each car brand or model should have its own \nunique sound that captured just the car personality the brand \nwished to convey. Porsche added loudspeakers to its electric car pro-\ntotype to give it the same “throaty growl” as its gasoline-powered \ncars. Nissan wondered whether a hybrid automobile should sound \nlike tweeting birds. Some manufacturers thought all cars should \nsound the same, with standardized sounds and sound levels, \nmaking it easier for everyone to learn how to interpret them. Some \nblind people thought they should sound like cars—you know, gas-\noline engines, following the old tradition that new technologies \nmust always copy the old.\n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback 159\nSkeuomorphic is the technical term for incorporating old, fa-\nmiliar ideas into new technologies, even though they no longer \nplay a functional role. Skeuomorphic designs are often comfort-\nable for traditionalists, and indeed the history of technology \nshows that new technologies and materials often slavishly im-\nitate the old for no apparent reason except that is what people \nknow how to do. Early automobiles looked like horse-driven \ncarriages without the horses (which is also why they were called \nhorseless carriages); early plastics were designed to look like \nwood; folders in computer file systems often look the same as \npaper folders, complete with tabs. One way of overcoming the \nfear of the new is to make it look like the old. This practice is \ndecried by design purists, but in fact, it has its benefits in eas-\ning the transition from the old to the new. It gives comfort and \nmakes learning easier. Existing conceptual models need only be \nmodified rather than replaced. Eventually, new forms emerge \nthat have no relationship to the old, but the skeuomorphic de-\nsigns probably helped the transition.\nWhen it came to deciding what sounds the new silent automo-\nbiles should generate, those who wanted differentiation ruled the \nday, yet everyone also agreed that there had to be some standards. \nIt should be possible to determine that the sound is coming from \nan automobile, to identify its location, direction, and speed. No \nsound would be necessary once the car was going fast enough, in \npart because tire noise would be sufficient. Some standardization \nwould be required, although with a lot of leeway. International \nstandards committees started their procedures. Various countries, \nunhappy with the normally glacial speed of standards agreements \nand under pressure from their communities, started drafting legis-\nlation. Companies scurried to develop appropriate sounds, hiring \nexperts in psychoacoustics, psychologists, and Hollywood sound \ndesigners.\nThe United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administra-\ntion issued a set of principles along with a detailed list of require-\nments, including sound levels, spectra, and other criteria. The full \ndocument is 248 pages. The document states:\n\n\n160 The Design of Everyday Things\nThis standard will ensure that blind, visually-impaired, and other pe-\ndestrians are able to detect and recognize nearby hybrid and electric \nvehicles by requiring that hybrid and electric vehicles emit sound that \npedestrians will be able to hear in a range of ambient environments and \ncontain acoustic signal content that pedestrians will recognize as be-\ning emitted from a vehicle. The proposed standard establishes minimum \nsound requirements for hybrid and electric vehicles when operating un-\nder 30 kilometers per hour (km/h) (18 mph), when the vehicle’s starting \nsystem is activated but the vehicle is stationary, and when the vehicle \nis operating in reverse. The agency chose a crossover speed of 30 km/h \nbecause this was the speed at which the sound levels of the hybrid and \nelectric vehicles measured by the agency approximated the sound levels \nproduced by similar internal combustion engine vehicles. (Department \nof Transportation, 2013.)\nAs I write this, sound designers are still experimenting. The au-\ntomobile companies, lawmakers, and standards committees are \nstill at work. Standards are not expected until 2014 or later, and \nthen it will take considerable time to be deployed to the millions of \nvehicles across the world.\nWhat principles should be used for the design sounds of elec-\ntric vehicles (including hybrids)? The sounds have to meet sev-\neral criteria:\n•  Alerting. The sound will indicate the presence of an electric vehicle.\n•  Orientation. The sound will make it possible to determine where the \nvehicle is located, a rough idea of its speed, and whether it is moving \ntoward or away from the listener.\n•  Lack of annoyance. Because these sounds will be heard frequently \neven in light traffic and continually in heavy traffic, they must not be \nannoying. Note the contrast with sirens, horns, and backup signals, \nall of which are intended to be aggressive warnings. Such sounds \nare deliberately unpleasant, but because they are infrequent and for \nrelatively short duration, they are acceptable. The challenge faced by \nelectric vehicle sounds is to alert and orient, not annoy.\n\n\n \nfour: Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback \n161\n•  Standardization versus individualization. Standardization is nec-\nessary to ensure that all electric vehicle sounds can readily be in-\nterpreted. If they vary too much, novel sounds might confuse the \nlistener. Individualization has two functions: safety and marketing. \nFrom a safety point of view, if there were many vehicles present on \nthe street, individualization would allow vehicles to be tracked. This \nis especially important at crowded intersections. From a marketing \npoint of view, individualization can ensure that each brand of electric \nvehicle has its own unique characteristic, perhaps matching the qual-\nity of the sound to the brand image. \nStand still on a street corner and listen carefully to the vehicles \naround you. Listen to the silent bicycles and to the artificial sounds \nof electric cars. Do the cars meet the criteria? After years of trying \nto make cars run more quietly, who would have thought that one \nday we would spend years of effort and tens of millions of dollars \nto add sound?\n",

How is it \nthat so many people are so incompetent? Answer: They \naren’t. It’s a design problem.\nIf the number of accidents blamed upon human error were 1 to \n5 percent, I might believe that people were at fault. But when the \npercentage is so high, then clearly other factors must be involved. \nWhen something happens this frequently, there must be another \nunderlying factor.\nWhen a bridge collapses, we analyze the incident to find the \ncauses of the collapse and reformulate the design rules to ensure \nthat form of accident will never happen again. When we discover \nthat electronic equipment is malfunctioning because it is responding \nto unavoidable electrical noise, we redesign the circuits to be more \ntolerant of the noise. But when an accident is thought to be caused \nby people, we blame them and then continue to do things just as \nwe have always done.\nPhysical limitations are well understood by designers; mental \nlimitations are greatly misunderstood. We should treat all failures \nin the same way: find the fundamental causes and redesign the \nsystem so that these can no longer lead to problems. We design \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 163\nequipment that requires people to be fully alert and attentive for \nhours, or to remember archaic, confusing procedures even if they \nare only used infrequently, sometimes only once in a lifetime. We \nput people in boring environments with nothing to do for hours on \nend, until suddenly they must respond quickly and accurately. Or \nwe subject them to complex, high-workload environments, where \nthey are continually interrupted while having to do multiple tasks \nsimultaneously. Then we wonder why there is failure.\nEven worse is that when I talk to the designers and administra-\ntors of these systems, they admit that they too have nodded off \nwhile supposedly working. Some even admit to falling asleep for \nan instant while driving. They admit to turning the wrong stove \nburners on or off in their homes, and to other small but signifi-\ncant errors. Yet when their workers do this, they blame them for \n“human error.” And when employees or customers have similar \nissues, they are blamed for not following the directions properly, \nor for not being fully alert and attentive.\nUnderstanding Why There Is Error\nError occurs for many reasons. The most common is in the nature \nof the tasks and procedures that require people to behave in un-\nnatural ways—staying alert for hours at a time, providing precise, \naccurate control specifications, all the while multitasking, doing \nseveral things at once, and subjected to multiple interfering activ-\nities. Interruptions are a common reason for error, not helped by \ndesigns and procedures that assume full, dedicated attention yet \nthat do not make it easy to resume operations after an interruption. \nAnd finally, perhaps the worst culprit of all, is the attitude of peo-\nple toward errors. \nWhen an error causes a financial loss or, worse, leads to an injury \nor death, a special committee is convened to investigate the cause \nand, almost without fail, guilty people are found. The next step \nis to blame and punish them with a monetary fine, or by firing or \njailing them. Sometimes a lesser punishment is proclaimed: make \nthe guilty parties go through more training. Blame and punish; \nblame and train. The investigations and resulting punishments feel \n\n\n164 The Design of Everyday Things\ngood: “We caught the culprit.” But it doesn’t cure the problem: the \nsame error will occur over and over again. Instead, when an error \nhappens, we should determine why, then redesign the product \nor the procedures being followed so that it will never occur again \nor, if it does, so that it will have minimal impact.\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS\nRoot cause analysis is the name of the game: investigate the acci-\ndent until the single, underlying cause is found. What this ought to \nmean is that when people have indeed made erroneous decisions \nor actions, we should determine what caused them to err. This is \nwhat root cause analysis ought to be about. Alas, all too often it \nstops once a person is found to have acted inappropriately.\nTrying to find the cause of an accident sounds good but it is \nflawed for two reasons. First, most accidents do not have a single \ncause: there are usually multiple things that went wrong, multiple \nevents that, had any one of them not occurred, would have pre-\nvented the accident. This is what James Reason, the noted British \nauthority on human error, has called the “Swiss cheese model of \naccidents” (shown in Figure 5.3 of this chapter on page 208, and \ndiscussed in more detail there).\nSecond, why does the root cause analysis stop as soon as a hu-\nman error is found? If a machine stops working, we don’t stop the \nanalysis when we discover a broken part. Instead, we ask: “Why \ndid the part break? Was it an inferior part? Were the required spec-\nifications too low? Did something apply too high a load on the \npart?” We keep asking questions until we are satisfied that we \nunderstand the reasons for the failure: then we set out to remedy \nthem. We should do the same thing when we find human error: \nWe should discover what led to the error. When root cause analysis \ndiscovers a human error in the chain, its work has just begun: now \nwe apply the analysis to understand why the error occurred, and \nwhat can be done to prevent it.\nOne of the most sophisticated airplanes in the world is the US \nAir Force’s F-22. However, it has been involved in a number of \naccidents, and pilots have complained that they suffered oxygen \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 165\ndeprivation (hypoxia). In 2010, a crash destroyed an F-22 and \nkilled the pilot. The Air Force investigation board studied the inci-\ndent and two years later, in 2012, released a report that blamed the \naccident on pilot error: “failure to recognize and initiate a timely \ndive recovery due to channelized attention, breakdown of visual \nscan and unrecognized spatial distortion.”\nIn 2013, the Inspector General’s office of the US Department of \nDefense reviewed the Air Force’s findings, disagreeing with the as-\nsessment. In my opinion, this time a proper root cause analysis was \ndone. The Inspector General asked “why sudden incapacitation or \nunconsciousness was not considered a contributory factor.” The Air \nForce, to nobody’s surprise, disagreed with the criticism. They ar-\ngued that they had done a thorough review and that their conclu-\nsion “was supported by clear and convincing evidence.” Their only \nfault was that the report “could have been more clearly written.”\nIt is only slightly unfair to parody the two reports this way:\nAir Force: It was pilot error—the pilot failed to take corrective action.\nInspector General: That’s because the pilot was probably unconscious.\nAir Force: So you agree, the pilot failed to correct the problem.\nTHE FIVE WHYS\nRoot cause analysis is intended to determine the underlying cause \nof an incident, not the proximate cause. The Japanese have long \nfollowed a procedure for getting at root causes that they call the \n“Five Whys,” originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda and used by \nthe Toyota Motor Company as part of the Toyota Production Sys-\ntem for improving quality. Today it is widely deployed. Basically, \nit means that when searching for the reason, even after you have \nfound one, do not stop: ask why that was the case. And then ask \nwhy again. Keep asking until you have uncovered the true under-\nlying causes. Does it take exactly five? No, but calling the proce-\ndure “Five Whys” emphasizes the need to keep going even after a \nreason has been found. Consider how this might be applied to the \nanalysis of the F-22 crash:\n\n\n166 The Design of Everyday Things\nFive Whys\nQuestion \nAnswer\nQ1: Why did the plane crash? \nBecause it was in an uncontrolled   \n \ndive.\nQ2: Why didn’t the pilot recover from the dive? \nBecause the pilot failed to initiate a   \n \ntimely recovery.\nQ3: Why was that? \nBecause he might have been \n \nunconscious (or oxygen deprived).\nQ4: Why was that? \nWe don’t know. We need to find out.\nEtc.\nThe Five Whys of this example are only a partial analysis. For \nexample, we need to know why the plane was in a dive (the report \nexplains this, but it is too technical to go into here; suffice it to say \nthat it, too, suggests that the dive was related to a possible oxygen \ndeprivation).\nThe Five Whys do not guarantee success. The question why is \nambiguous and can lead to different answers by different investi-\ngators. There is still a tendency to stop too soon, perhaps when the \nlimit of the investigator’s understanding has been reached. It also \ntends to emphasize the need to find a single cause for an incident, \nwhereas most complex events have multiple, complex causal fac-\ntors. Nonetheless, it is a powerful technique.\nThe tendency to stop seeking reasons as soon as a human error \nhas been found is widespread. I once reviewed a number of acci-\ndents in which highly trained workers at an electric utility com-\npany had been electrocuted when they contacted or came too close \nto the high-voltage lines they were servicing. All the investigat-\ning committees found the workers to be at fault, something even \nthe workers (those who had survived) did not dispute. But when \nthe committees were investigating the complex causes of the in-\ncidents, why did they stop once they found a human error? Why \ndidn’t they keep going to find out why the error had occurred, \nwhat circumstances had led to it, and then, why those circum-\nstances had happened? The committees never went far enough to \nfind the deeper, root causes of the accidents. Nor did they consider \nredesigning the systems and procedures to make the incidents \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n167\neither impossible or far less likely. When people err, change the \nsystem so that type of error will be reduced or eliminated. When \ncomplete elimination is not possible, redesign to reduce the impact.\nIt wasn’t difficult for me to suggest simple changes to procedures \nthat would have prevented most of the incidents at the utility com-\npany. It had never occurred to the committee to think of this. The \nproblem is that to have followed my recommendations would \nhave meant changing the culture from an attitude among the field \nworkers that “We are supermen: we can solve any problem, repair \nthe most complex outage. We do not make errors.” It is not possi-\nble to eliminate human error if it is thought of as a personal failure \nrather than as a sign of poor design of procedures or equipment. \nMy report to the company executives was received politely. I was \neven thanked. Several years later I contacted a friend at the com-\npany and asked what changes they had made. “No changes,” he \nsaid. “And we are still injuring people.”\nOne big problem is that the natural tendency to blame someone \nfor an error is even shared by those who made the error, who \noften agree that it was their fault. People do tend to blame them-\nselves when they do something that, after the fact, seems inex-\ncusable. “I knew better,” is a common comment by those who \nhave erred. But when someone says, “It was my fault, I knew \nbetter,” this is not a valid analysis of the problem. That doesn’t \nhelp prevent its recurrence. When many people all have the same \nproblem, shouldn’t another cause be found? If the system lets you \nmake the error, it is badly designed. And if the system induces \nyou to make the error, then it is really badly designed. When I \nturn on the wrong stove burner, it is not due to my lack of knowl-\nedge: it is due to poor mapping between controls and burners. \nTeaching me the relationship will not stop the error from recur-\nring: redesigning the stove will.\nWe can’t fix problems unless people admit they exist. When \nwe blame people, it is then difficult to convince organizations to \nrestructure the design to eliminate these problems. After all, if a \nperson is at fault, replace the person. But seldom is this the case: \nusually the system, the procedures, and social pressures have led \n\n\n168 The Design of Everyday Things\nto the problems, and the problems won’t be fixed without address-\ning all of these factors.\nWhy do people err? Because the designs focus upon the require-\nments of the system and the machines, and not upon the re-\nquirements of people. Most machines require precise commands \nand guidance, forcing people to enter numerical information per-\nfectly. But people aren’t very good at great precision. We frequently \nmake errors when asked to type or write sequences of numbers \nor letters. This is well known: so why are machines still being de-\nsigned that require such great precision, where pressing the wrong \nkey can lead to horrendous results?\nPeople are creative, constructive, exploratory beings. We are par-\nticularly good at novelty, at creating new ways of doing things, \nand at seeing new opportunities. Dull, repetitive, precise require-\nments fight against these traits. We are alert to changes in the en-\nvironment, noticing new things, and then thinking about them \nand their implications. These are virtues, but they get turned into \nnegative features when we are forced to serve machines. Then we \nare punished for lapses in attention, for deviating from the tightly \nprescribed routines.\nA major cause of error is time stress. Time is often critical, es-\npecially in such places as manufacturing or chemical processing \nplants and hospitals. But even everyday tasks can have time pres-\nsures. Add environmental factors, such as poor weather or heavy \ntraffic, and the time stresses increase. In commercial establish-\nments, there is strong pressure not to slow the processes, because \ndoing so would inconvenience many, lead to significant loss of \nmoney, and, in a hospital, possibly decrease the quality of patient \ncare. There is a lot of pressure to push ahead with the work even \nwhen an outside observer would say it was dangerous to do so. \nIn many industries, if the operators actually obeyed all the proce-\ndures, the work would never get done. So we push the boundaries: \nwe stay up far longer than is natural. We try to do too many tasks \nat the same time. We drive faster than is safe. Most of the time we \nmanage okay. We might even be rewarded and praised for our he-\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 169\nroic efforts. But when things go wrong and we fail, then this same \nbehavior is blamed and punished.\nDeliberate Violations\nErrors are not the only type of human failures. Sometimes peo-\nple knowingly take risks. When the outcome is positive, they are \noften rewarded. When the result is negative, they might be pun-\nished. But how do we classify these deliberate violations of known, \nproper behavior? In the error literature, they tend to be ignored. In \nthe accident literature, they are an important component.\nDeliberate deviations play an important role in many accidents. \nThey are defined as cases where people intentionally violate pro-\ncedures and regulations. Why do they happen? Well, almost every \none of us has probably deliberately violated laws, rules, or even \nour own best judgment at times. Ever go faster than the speed \nlimit? Drive too fast in the snow or rain? Agree to do some hazard-\nous act, even while privately thinking it foolhardy to do so?\nIn many industries, the rules are written more with a goal toward \nlegal compliance than with an understanding of the work require-\nments. As a result, if workers followed the rules, they couldn’t get \ntheir jobs done. Do you sometimes prop open locked doors? Drive \nwith too little sleep? Work with co-workers even though you are ill \n(and might therefore be infectious)?\nRoutine violations occur when noncompliance is so frequent that \nit is ignored. Situational violations occur when there are special cir-\ncumstances (example: going through a red light “because no other \ncars were visible and I was late”). In some cases, the only way to \ncomplete a job might be to violate a rule or procedure.\nA major cause of violations is inappropriate rules or procedures \nthat not only invite violation but encourage it. Without the viola-\ntions, the work could not be done. Worse, when employees feel it \nnecessary to violate the rules in order to get the job done and, as a \nresult, succeed, they will probably be congratulated and rewarded. \nThis, of course, unwittingly rewards noncompliance. Cultures that \nencourage and commend violations set poor role models.\n",

The human error examined here is unintentional: \ndeliberate violations, by definition, are intentional deviations that \nare known to be risky, with the potential of doing harm.\nTwo Types of Errors: Slips and Mistakes\nMany years ago, the British psychologist James Reason and I de-\nveloped a general classification of human error. We divided human \nerror into two major categories: slips and mistakes (Figure 5.1). This \nclassification has proved to be of value for both theory and practice. \nIt is widely used in the study of error in such diverse areas as indus-\ntrial and aviation accidents, and medical errors. The discussion gets \na little technical, so I have kept technicalities to a minimum. This \ntopic is of extreme importance to design, so stick with it.\nDEFINITIONS: ERRORS, SLIPS, AND MISTAKES\nHuman error is defined as any deviance from “appropriate” be-\nhavior. The word appropriate is in quotes because in many circum-\nstances, the appropriate behavior is not known or is only deter-\nFIGURE 5.1. Classification of \nErrors. Errors have two major \nforms. Slips occur when the goal \nis correct, but the required actions \nare not done properly: the exe-\ncution is flawed. Mistakes occur \nwhen the goal or plan is wrong. \nSlips and mistakes can be further \ndivided based upon their under-\nlying causes. Memory lapses can \nlead to either slips or mistakes, \ndepending upon whether the \nmemory failure was at the highest \nlevel of cognition (mistakes) or at \nlower (subconscious) levels (slips). \nAlthough deliberate violations of \nprocedures are clearly inappropri-\nate behaviors that often lead to ac-\ncidents, these are not considered as \nerrors (see discussion in text).\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n171\nmined after the fact. But still, error is defined as deviance from the \ngenerally accepted correct or appropriate behavior.\nError is the general term for all wrong actions. There are two ma-\njor classes of error: slips and mistakes, as shown in Figure 5.1; slips \nare further divided into two major classes and mistakes into three. \nThese categories of errors all have different implications for design. \nI now turn to a more detailed look at these classes of errors and \ntheir design implications.\nSLIPS\nA slip occurs when a person intends to do one action and ends up \ndoing something else. With a slip, the action performed is not the \nsame as the action that was intended.\nThere are two major classes of slips: action-based and memory-lapse. \nIn action-based slips, the wrong action is performed. In lapses, \nmemory fails, so the intended action is not done or its results not \nevaluated. Action-based slips and memory lapses can be further \nclassified according to their causes.\nExample of an action-based slip. I poured some milk into my coffee \nand then put the coffee cup into the refrigerator. This is the correct \naction applied to the wrong object.\nExample of a memory-lapse slip. I forget to turn off the gas burner on \nmy stove after cooking dinner. \nMISTAKES\nA mistake occurs when the wrong goal is established or the wrong \nplan is formed. From that point on, even if the actions are executed \nproperly they are part of the error, because the actions themselves are \ninappropriate—they are part of the wrong plan. With a mistake, the \naction that is performed matches the plan: it is the plan that is wrong.\nMistakes have three major classes: rule-based, knowledge-based, \nand memory-lapse. In a rule-based mistake, the person has appro-\npriately diagnosed the situation, but then decided upon an er-\nroneous course of action: the wrong rule is being followed. In a \nknowledge-based mistake, the problem is misdiagnosed because \n\n\n172 The Design of Everyday Things\nof erroneous or incomplete knowledge. Memory-lapse mistakes \ntake place when there is forgetting at the stages of goals, plans, \nor evaluation. Two of the mistakes leading to the “Gimli Glider” \nBoeing 767 emergency landing were:\nExample of knowledge-based mistake. Weight of fuel was computed \nin pounds instead of kilograms.\nExample of memory-lapse mistake. A mechanic failed to complete \ntroubleshooting because of distraction.\nERROR AND THE SEVEN STAGES OF ACTION\nErrors can be understood through reference to the seven stages \nof the action cycle of Chapter 2 (Figure 5.2). Mistakes are er-\nrors in setting the goal or plan, and in comparing results with \nexpectations—the higher levels of cognition. Slips happen in \nthe execution of a plan, or in the perception or interpretation of \nthe outcome—the lower stages. Memory lapses can happen at any \nof the eight transitions between stages, shown by the X’s in Figure \n5.2B. A memory lapse at one of these transitions stops the action \ncycle from proceeding, and so the desired action is not completed.\nFIGURE 5.2. Where Slips and Mistakes Originate in the Action Cycle. Figure A \nshows that action slips come from the bottom four stages of the action cycle and mis-\ntakes from the top three stages. Memory lapses impact the transitions between stages \n(shown by the X’s in Figure B). Memory lapses at the higher levels lead to mistakes, and \nlapses at the lower levels lead to slips.\nA.\nB.\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n173\nSlips are the result of subconscious actions getting waylaid en \nroute. Mistakes result from conscious deliberations. The same pro-\ncesses that make us creative and insightful by allowing us to see \nrelationships between apparently unrelated things, that let us leap \nto correct conclusions on the basis of partial or even faulty evi-\ndence, also lead to mistakes. Our ability to generalize from small \namounts of information helps tremendously in new situations; but \nsometimes we generalize too rapidly, classifying a new situation \nas similar to an old one when, in fact, there are significant discrep-\nancies. This leads to mistakes that can be difficult to discover, let \nalone eliminate.\nThe Classification of Slips\nA colleague reported that he went to his car to drive to work. As he \ndrove away, he realized that he had forgotten his briefcase, so he turned \naround and went back. He stopped the car, turned off the engine, and \nunbuckled his wristwatch. Yes, his wristwatch, instead of his seatbelt.\nThe story illustrates both a memory-lapse slip and an action slip. \nThe forgetting of the briefcase is a memory-lapse slip. The unbuck-\nling of the wristwatch is an action slip, in this case a combination \nof description-similarity and capture error (described later in this \nchapter).\nMost everyday errors are slips. Intending to do one action, you \nfind yourself doing another. When a person says something clearly \nand distinctly to you, you “hear” something quite different. The \nstudy of slips is the study of the psychology of everyday errors—\nwhat Freud called “the psychopathology of everyday life.” Freud \nbelieved that slips have hidden, dark meanings, but most are ac-\ncounted for by rather simple mental mechanisms.\nAn interesting property of slips is that, paradoxically, they tend \nto occur more frequently to skilled people than to novices. Why? \nBecause slips often result from a lack of attention to the task. \nSkilled people—experts—tend to perform tasks automatically, un-\nder subconscious control. Novices have to pay considerable con-\nscious attention, resulting in a relatively low occurrence of slips.\n\n\n174 The Design of Everyday Things\nSome slips result from the similarities of actions. Or an event \nin the world may automatically trigger an action. Sometimes our \nthoughts and actions may remind us of unintended actions, \nwhich we then perform. There are numerous different kinds of \naction slips, categorized by the underlying mechanisms that give \nrise to them. The three most relevant to design are:\n• capture slips\n• description-similarity slips\n• mode errors\nCAPTURE SLIPS\nI was using a copying machine, and I was counting the pages. I found \nmyself counting, “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King.” I had \nbeen playing cards recently.\nThe capture slip is defined as the situation where, instead of the \ndesired activity, a more frequently or recently performed one gets \ndone instead: it captures the activity. Capture errors require that \npart of the action sequences involved in the two activities be iden-\ntical, with one sequence being far more familiar than the other. \nAfter doing the identical part, the more frequent or more recent \nactivity continues, and the intended one does not get done. Sel-\ndom, if ever, does the unfamiliar sequence capture the familiar one. \nAll that is needed is a lapse of attention to the desired action at \nthe critical junction when the identical portions of the sequences \ndiverge into the two different activities. Capture errors are, there-\nfore, partial memory-lapse errors. Interestingly, capture errors are \nmore prevalent in experienced skilled people than in beginners, in \npart because the experienced person has automated the required \nactions and may not be paying conscious attention when the in-\ntended action deviates from the more frequent one.\nDesigners need to avoid procedures that have identical open-\ning steps but then diverge. The more experienced the workers, the \nmore likely they are to fall prey to capture. Whenever possible, \nsequences should be designed to differ from the very start.\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n175\nDESCRIPTION-SIMILARITY SLIPS\nA former student reported that one day he came home from jogging, took \noff his sweaty shirt, and rolled it up in a ball, intending to throw it in \nthe laundry basket. Instead he threw it in the toilet. (It wasn’t poor aim: \nthe laundry basket and toilet were in different rooms.)\nIn the slip known as a description-similarity slip, the error is to \nact upon an item similar to the target. This happens when the de-\nscription of the target is sufficiently vague. Much as we saw in \nChapter 3, Figure 3.1, where people had difficulty distinguishing \namong different images of money because their internal descrip-\ntions did not have sufficient discriminating information, the same \nthing can happen to us, especially when we are tired, stressed, or \noverloaded. In the example that opened this section, both the laun-\ndry basket and the toilet bowl are containers, and if the description \nof the target was sufficiently ambiguous, such as “a large enough \ncontainer,” the slip could be triggered.\nRemember the discussion in Chapter 3 that most objects don’t \nneed precise descriptions, simply enough precision to distinguish \nthe desired target from alternatives. This means that a description \nthat usually suffices may fail when the situation changes so that \nmultiple similar items now match the description. Description-\nsimilarity errors result in performing the correct action on the \nwrong object. Obviously, the more the wrong and right objects \nhave in common, the more likely the errors are to occur. Simi-\nlarly, the more objects present at the same time, the more likely \nthe error.\nDesigners need to ensure that controls and displays for differ-\nent purposes are significantly different from one another. A lineup \nof identical-looking switches or displays is very apt to lead to \ndescription-similarity error. In the design of airplane cockpits, \nmany controls are shape coded so that they both look and feel dif-\nferent from one another: the throttle levers are different from the \nflap levers (which might look and feel like a wing flap), which are \ndifferent from the landing gear control (which might look and feel \nlike a wheel).\n\n\n176 The Design of Everyday Things\nMEMORY-LAPSE SLIPS\nErrors caused by memory failures are common. Consider these \nexamples:\n•  Making copies of a document, walking off with the copy, but leaving \nthe original inside the machine.\n•  Forgetting a child. This error has numerous examples, such as leaving \na child behind at a rest stop during a car trip, or in the dressing room \nof a department store, or a new mother forgetting her one-month-old \nand having to go to the police for help in finding the baby.\n•  Losing a pen because it was taken out to write something, then put \ndown while doing some other task. The pen is forgotten in the ac-\ntivities of putting away a checkbook, picking up goods, talking to a \nsalesperson or friends, and so on. Or the reverse: borrowing a pen, \nusing it, and then putting it away in your pocket or purse, even \nthough it is someone else’s (this is also a capture error).\n•  Using a bank or credit card to withdraw money from an automatic \nteller machine, then walking off without the card, is such a frequent \nerror that many machines now have a forcing function: the card must \nbe removed before the money will be delivered. Of course, it is then \npossible to walk off without the money, but this is less likely than \nforgetting the card because money is the goal of using the machine. \nMemory lapses are common causes of error. They can lead to \nseveral kinds of errors: failing to do all of the steps of a procedure; \nrepeating steps; forgetting the outcome of an action; or forgetting \nthe goal or plan, thereby causing the action to be stopped.\nThe immediate cause of most memory-lapse failures is interrup-\ntions, events that intervene between the time an action is decided \nupon and the time it is completed. Quite often the interference \ncomes from the machines we are using: the many steps required \nbetween the start and finish of the operations can overload the ca-\npacity of short-term or working memory.\nThere are several ways to combat memory-lapse errors. One is to \nminimize the number of steps; another, to provide vivid reminders \nof steps that need to be completed. A superior method is to use the \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n177\nforcing function of Chapter 4. For example, automated teller ma-\nchines often require removal of the bank card before delivering the \nrequested money: this prevents forgetting the bank card, capital-\nizing on the fact that people seldom forget the goal of the activity, \nin this case the money. With pens, the solution is simply to prevent \ntheir removal, perhaps by chaining public pens to the counter. Not \nall memory-lapse errors lend themselves to simple solutions. In \nmany cases the interruptions come from outside the system, where \nthe designer has no control.\nMODE-ERROR SLIPS\nA mode error occurs when a device has different states in which \nthe same controls have different meanings: we call these states \nmodes. Mode errors are inevitable in anything that has more pos-\nsible actions than it has controls or displays; that is, the controls \nmean different things in the different modes. This is unavoidable \nas we add more and more functions to our devices. \nEver turn off the wrong device in your home entertainment sys-\ntem? This happens when one control is used for multiple purposes. \nIn the home, this is simply frustrating. In industry, the confusion \nthat results when operators believe the system to be in one mode, \nwhen in reality it is in another, has resulted in serious accidents \nand loss of life.\nIt is tempting to save money and space by having a single control \nserve multiple purposes. Suppose there are ten different functions \non a device. Instead of using ten separate knobs or switches—\nwhich would take considerable space, add extra cost, and appear \nintimidatingly complex, why not use just two controls, one to select \nthe function, the other to set the function to the desired condition? \nAlthough the resulting design appears quite simple and easy to \nuse, this apparent simplicity masks the underlying complexity of \nuse. The operator must always be completely aware of the mode, of \nwhat function is active. Alas, the prevalence of mode errors shows \nthis assumption to be false. Yes, if I select a mode and then imme-\ndiately adjust the parameters, I am not apt to be confused about \nthe state. But what if I select the mode and then get interrupted \n",

Or, as in the case of the Airbus accident discussed be-\nlow, the two modes being selected are very similar in control \nand function, but have different operating characteristics, which \nmeans that the resulting mode error is difficult to discover? \nSometimes the use of modes is justifiable, such as the need to \nput many controls and displays in a small, restricted space, but \nwhatever the reason, modes are a common cause of confusion \nand error.\nAlarm clocks often use the same controls and display for setting \nthe time of day and the time the alarm should go off, and many \nof us have thereby set one when we meant the other. Similarly, \nwhen time is displayed on a twelve-hour scale, it is easy to set the \nalarm to go off at seven a.m. only later to discover that the alarm \nhad been set for seven p.m. The use of “a.m.” and “p.m.” to distin-\nguish times before and after noon is a common source of confu-\nsion and error, hence the common use of 24-hour time specification \nthroughout most of the world (the major exceptions being North \nAmerica, Australia, India, and the Philippines). Watches with mul-\ntiple functions have similar problems, in this case required because \nof the small amount of space available for controls and displays. \nModes exist in most computer programs, in our cell phones, and \nin the automatic controls of commercial aircraft. A number of se-\nrious accidents in commercial aviation can be attributed to mode \nerrors, especially in aircraft that use automatic systems (which \nhave a large number of complex modes). As automobiles become \nmore complex, with the dashboard controls for driving, heating \nand air-conditioning, entertainment, and navigation, modes are \nincreasingly common.\nAn accident with an Airbus airplane illustrates the problem. The \nflight control equipment (often referred to as the automatic pilot) \nhad two modes, one for controlling vertical speed, the other for \ncontrolling the flight path’s angle of descent. In one case, when the \npilots were attempting to land, the pilots thought that they were \ncontrolling the angle of descent, whereas they had accidentally \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n179\nselected the mode that controlled speed of descent. The number \n(–3.3) that was entered into the system to represent an appropriate \nangle (–3.3º) was too steep a rate of descent when interpreted as \nvertical speed (–3,300 feet/minute: –3.3º would only be –800 feet/\nminute). This mode confusion contributed to the resulting fatal ac-\ncident. After a detailed study of the accident, Airbus changed the \ndisplay on the instrument so that vertical speed would always be \ndisplayed with a four-digit number and angle with two digits, thus \nreducing the chance of confusion.\nMode error is really design error. Mode errors are especially \nlikely where the equipment does not make the mode visible, so \nthe user is expected to remember what mode has been established, \nsometimes hours earlier, during which time many intervening \nevents might have occurred. Designers must try to avoid modes, \nbut if they are necessary, the equipment must make it obvious \nwhich mode is invoked. Once again, designers must always com-\npensate for interfering activities.\nThe Classification of Mistakes\nMistakes result from the choice of inappropriate goals and plans or \nfrom faulty comparison of the outcome with the goals during eval-\nuation. In mistakes, a person makes a poor decision, misclassifies a \nsituation, or fails to take all the relevant factors into account. Many \nmistakes arise from the vagaries of human thought, often because \npeople tend to rely upon remembered experiences rather than on \nmore systematic analysis. We make decisions based upon what is \nin our memory. But as discussed in Chapter 3, retrieval from long-\nterm memory is actually a reconstruction rather than an accurate \nrecord. As a result, it is subject to numerous biases. Among other \nthings, our memories tend to be biased toward overgeneralization \nof the commonplace and overemphasis of the discrepant.\nThe Danish engineer Jens Rasmussen distinguished among three \nmodes of behavior: skill-based, rule-based, and knowledge-based. \nThis three-level classification scheme provides a practical tool that \nhas found wide acceptance in applied areas, such as the design of \n\n\n180 The Design of Everyday Things\nmany industrial systems. Skill-based behavior occurs when work-\ners are extremely expert at their jobs, so they can do the everyday, \nroutine tasks with little or no thought or conscious attention. The \nmost common form of errors in skill-based behavior is slips.\nRule-based behavior occurs when the normal routine is no lon-\nger applicable but the new situation is one that is known, so there \nis already a well-prescribed course of action: a rule. Rules simply \nmight be learned behaviors from previous experiences, but in-\ncludes formal procedures prescribed in courses and manuals, usu-\nally in the form of “if-then” statements, such as, “If the engine will \nnot start, then do [the appropriate action].” Errors with rule-based \nbehavior can be either a mistake or a slip. If the wrong rule is se-\nlected, this would be a mistake. If the error occurs during the exe-\ncution of the rule, it is most likely a slip. \nKnowledge-based procedures occur when unfamiliar events oc-\ncur, where neither existing skills nor rules apply. In this case, there \nmust be considerable reasoning and problem-solving. Plans might \nbe developed, tested, and then used or modified. Here, conceptual \nmodels are essential in guiding development of the plan and inter-\npretation of the situation.\nIn both rule-based and knowledge-based situations, the most seri-\nous mistakes occur when the situation is misdiagnosed. As a result, \nan inappropriate rule is executed, or in the case of knowledge-based \nproblems, the effort is addressed to solving the wrong problem. In \naddition, with misdiagnosis of the problem comes misinterpreta-\ntion of the environment, as well as faulty comparisons of the cur-\nrent state with expectations. These kinds of mistakes can be very \ndifficult to detect and correct.\nRULE-BASED MISTAKES\nWhen new procedures have to be invoked or when simple prob-\nlems arise, we can characterize the actions of skilled people as rule-\nbased. Some rules come from experience; others are formal proce-\ndures in manuals or rulebooks, or even less formal guides, such \nas cookbooks for food preparation. In either case, all we must do \nis identify the situation, select the proper rule, and then follow it.\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n181\nWhen driving, behavior follows well-learned rules. Is the light \nred? If so, stop the car. Wish to turn left? Signal the intention to \nturn and move as far left as legally permitted: slow the vehicle and \nwait for a safe break in traffic, all the while following the traffic \nrules and relevant signs and lights.\nRule-based mistakes occur in multiple ways:\n•  The situation is mistakenly interpreted, thereby invoking the wrong \ngoal or plan, leading to following an inappropriate rule.\n•  The correct rule is invoked, but the rule itself is faulty, either because \nit was formulated improperly or because conditions are different \nthan assumed by the rule or through incomplete knowledge used to \ndetermine the rule. All of these lead to knowledge-based mistakes.\n•  The correct rule is invoked, but the outcome is incorrectly evaluated. \nThis error in evaluation, usually rule- or knowledge-based itself, can \nlead to further problems as the action cycle continues.\nExample 1:  In 2013, at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, Brazil, pyro-\ntechnics used by the band ignited a fire that killed over 230 people. \nThe tragedy illustrates several mistakes. The band made a knowl-\nedge-based mistake when they used outdoor flares, which ignited the \nceiling’s acoustic tiles. The band thought the flares were safe. Many \npeople rushed into the rest rooms, mistakenly thinking they were ex-\nits: they died. Early reports suggested that the guards, unaware of \nthe fire, at first mistakenly blocked people from leaving the building. \nWhy? Because nightclub attendees would sometimes leave without \npaying for their drinks.\n The mistake was in devising a rule that did not take account of \nemergencies. A root cause analysis would reveal that the goal was \nto prevent inappropriate exit but still allow the doors to be used in \nan emergency. One solution is doors that trigger alarms when used, \ndeterring people trying to sneak out, but allowing exit when needed. \nExample 2: Turning the thermostat of an oven to its maximum tempera-\nture to get it to the proper cooking temperature faster is a mistake \nbased upon a false conceptual model of the way the oven works. If \nthe person wanders off and forgets to come back and check the oven \n\n\n182 The Design of Everyday Things\ntemperature after a reasonable period (a memory-lapse slip), the im-\nproper high setting of the oven temperature can lead to an accident, \npossibly a fire.\nExample 3: A driver, unaccustomed to anti-lock brakes, encounters \nan unexpected object in the road on a wet, rainy day. The driver ap-\nplies full force to the brakes but the car skids, triggering the anti-lock \nbrakes to rapidly turn the brakes on and off, as they are designed to \ndo. The driver, feeling the vibrations, believes that it indicates mal-\nfunction and therefore lifts his foot off the brake pedal. In fact, the \nvibration is a signal that anti-lock brakes are working properly. The \ndriver’s misevaluation leads to the wrong behavior.\nRule-based mistakes are difficult to avoid and then difficult to \ndetect. Once the situation has been classified, the selection of the \nappropriate rule is often straightforward. But what if the classifica-\ntion of the situation is wrong? This is difficult to discover because \nthere is usually considerable evidence to support the erroneous \nclassification of the situation and the choice of rule. In complex \nsituations, the problem is too much information: information that \nboth supports the decision and also contradicts it. In the face of \ntime pressures to make a decision, it is difficult to know which \nevidence to consider, which to reject. People usually decide by tak-\ning the current situation and matching it with something that hap-\npened earlier. Although human memory is quite good at matching \nexamples from the past with the present situation, this doesn’t \nmean that the matching is accurate or appropriate. The matching \nis biased by recency, regularity, and uniqueness. Recent events are \nremembered far better than less recent ones. Frequent events \nare remembered through their regularities, and unique events are \nremembered because of their uniqueness. But suppose the current \nevent is different from all that has been experienced before: people \nare still apt to find some match in memory to use as a guide. The \nsame powers that make us so good at dealing with the common \nand the unique lead to severe error with novel events. \nWhat is a designer to do? Provide as much guidance as possible \nto ensure that the current state of things is displayed in a coherent \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 183\nand easily interpreted format—ideally graphical. This is a difficult \nproblem. All major decision makers worry about the complexity \nof real-world events, where the problem is often too much infor-\nmation, much of it contradictory. Often, decisions must be made \nquickly. Sometimes it isn’t even clear that there is an incident or \nthat a decision is actually being made.\nThink of it like this. In your home, there are probably a number \nof broken or misbehaving items. There might be some burnt-out \nlights, or (in my home) a reading light that works fine for a little \nwhile, then goes out: we have to walk over and wiggle the fluo-\nrescent bulb. There might be a leaky faucet or other minor faults \nthat you know about but are postponing action to remedy. Now \nconsider a major process-control manufacturing plant (an oil refin-\nery, a chemical plant, or a nuclear power plant). These have thou-\nsands, perhaps tens of thousands, of valves and gauges, displays \nand controls, and so on. Even the best of plants always has some \nfaulty parts. The maintenance crews always have a list of items to \ntake care of. With all the alarms that trigger when a problem arises, \neven though it might be minor, and all the everyday failures, how \ndoes one know which might be a significant indicator of a major \nproblem? Every single one usually has a simple, rational explana-\ntion, so not making it an urgent item is a sensible decision. In fact, \nthe maintenance crew simply adds it to a list. Most of the time, this is \nthe correct decision. The one time in a thousand (or even, one time \nin a million) that the decision is wrong makes it the one they will \nbe blamed for: how could they have missed such obvious signals? \nHindsight is always superior to foresight. When the accident in-\nvestigation committee reviews the event that contributed to the \nproblem, they know what actually happened, so it is easy for them \nto pick out which information was relevant, which was not. This is \nretrospective decision making. But when the incident was taking \nplace, the people were probably overwhelmed with far too much \nirrelevant information and probably not a lot of relevant infor-\nmation. How were they to know which to attend to and which to \nignore? Most of the time, experienced operators get things right. \nThe one time they fail, the retrospective analysis is apt to condemn \n\n\n184 The Design of Everyday Things\nthem for missing the obvious. Well, during the event, nothing may \nbe obvious. I return to this topic later in the chapter.\nYou will face this while driving, while handling your finances, \nand while just going through your daily life. Most of the unusual \nincidents you read about are not relevant to you, so you can safely \nignore them. Which things should be paid attention to, which \nshould be ignored? Industry faces this problem all the time, as do \ngovernments. The intelligence communities are swamped with \ndata. How do they decide which cases are serious? The public \nhears about their mistakes, but not about the far more frequent \ncases that they got right or about the times they ignored data as not \nbeing meaningful—and were correct to do so.\nIf every decision had to be questioned, nothing would ever get \ndone. But if decisions are not questioned, there will be major \nmistakes—rarely, but often of substantial penalty.\nThe design challenge is to present the information about the state \nof the system (a device, vehicle, plant, or activities being moni-\ntored) in a way that is easy to assimilate and interpret, as well as to \nprovide alternative explanations and interpretations. It is useful \nto question decisions, but impossible to do so if every action—or \nfailure to act—requires close attention.\nThis is a difficult problem with no obvious solution.\nKNOWLEDGE-BASED MISTAKES\nKnowledge-based behavior takes place when the situation is novel \nenough that there are no skills or rules to cover it. In this case, a \nnew procedure must be devised. Whereas skills and rules are con-\ntrolled at the behavioral level of human processing and are there-\nfore subconscious and automatic, knowledge-based behavior is \ncontrolled at the reflective level and is slow and conscious.\nWith knowledge-based behavior, people are consciously prob-\nlem solving. They are in an unknown situation and do not have \nany available skills or rules that apply directly. Knowledge-based \nbehavior is required either when a person encounters an unknown \nsituation, perhaps being asked to use some novel equipment, or \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 185\neven when doing a familiar task and things go wrong, leading to a \nnovel, uninterpretable state.\nThe best solution to knowledge-based situations is to be found \nin a good understanding of the situation, which in most cases also \ntranslates into an appropriate conceptual model. In complex cases, \nhelp is needed, and here is where good cooperative problem-solving \nskills and tools are required. Sometimes, good procedural manuals \n(paper or electronic) will do the job, especially if critical observa-\ntions can be used to arrive at the relevant procedures to follow. A \nmore powerful approach is to develop intelligent computer sys-\ntems, using good search and appropriate reasoning techniques \n(artificial-intelligence decision-making and problem-solving). The \ndifficulties here are in establishing the interaction of the people with \nthe automation: human teams and automated systems have to be \nthought of as collaborative, cooperative systems. Instead, they are \noften built by assigning the tasks that machines can do to the ma-\nchines and leaving the humans to do the rest. This usually means \nthat machines do the parts that are easy for people, but when the \nproblems become complex, which is precisely when people could \nuse assistance, that is when the machines usually fail. (I discuss \nthis problem extensively in The Design of Future Things.)\nMEMORY-LAPSE MISTAKES\nMemory lapses can lead to mistakes if the memory failure leads to \nforgetting the goal or plan of action. A common cause of the lapse \nis an interruption that leads to forgetting the evaluation of the cur-\nrent state of the environment. These lead to mistakes, not slips, be-\ncause the goals and plans become wrong. Forgetting earlier evalu-\nations often means remaking the decision, sometimes erroneously. \nThe design cures for memory-lapse mistakes are the same as for \nmemory-lapse slips: ensure that all the relevant information is con-\ntinuously available. The goals, plans, and current evaluation of \nthe system are of particular importance and should be continually \navailable. Far too many designs eliminate all signs of these items \nonce they have been made or acted upon. Once again, the designer \n",

Although at first it may not seem relevant to design, it has \nstrong influence on everyday behavior. In industrial settings, social \npressures can lead to misinterpretation, mistakes, and accidents. To \nunderstand human error, it is essential to understand social pressure.\nComplex problem-solving is required when one is faced with \nknowledge-based problems. In some cases, it can take teams of peo-\nple days to understand what is wrong and the best ways to respond. \nThis is especially true of situations where mistakes have been made \nin the diagnosis of the problem. Once the mistaken diagnosis is \nmade, all information from then on is interpreted from the wrong \npoint of view. Appropriate reconsiderations might only take place \nduring team turnover, when new people come into the situation \nwith a fresh viewpoint, allowing them to form different interpreta-\ntions of the events. Sometimes just asking one or more of the team \nmembers to take a few hours’ break can lead to the same fresh anal-\nysis (although it is understandably difficult to convince someone \nwho is battling an emergency situation to stop for a few hours).\nIn commercial installations, the pressure to keep systems run-\nning is immense. Considerable money might be lost if an expen-\nsive system is shut down. Operators are often under pressure not \nto do this. The result has at times been tragic. Nuclear power plants \nare kept running longer than is safe. Airplanes have taken off be-\nfore everything was ready and before the pilots had received per-\nmission. One such incident led to the largest accident in aviation \nhistory. Although the incident happened in 1977, a long time ago, \nthe lessons learned are still very relevant today.\nIn Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, a KLM Boeing 747 crashed \nduring takeoff into a Pan American 747 that was taxiing on the \nsame runway, killing 583 people. The KLM plane had not received \nclearance to take off, but the weather was starting to get bad and \nthe crew had already been delayed for too long (even being on the \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n187\nCanary Islands was a diversion from the scheduled flight—bad \nweather had prevented their landing at their scheduled destina-\ntion). And the Pan American flight should not have been on the \nrunway, but there was considerable misunderstanding between \nthe pilots and the air traffic controllers. Furthermore, the fog was \ncoming in so thickly that neither plane’s crew could see the other.\nIn the Tenerife disaster, time and economic pressures were acting \ntogether with cultural and weather conditions. The Pan American \npilots questioned their orders to taxi on the runway, but they con-\ntinued anyway. The first officer of the KLM flight voiced minor \nobjections to the captain, trying to explain that they were not yet \ncleared for takeoff (but the first officer was very junior to the cap-\ntain, who was one of KLM’s most respected pilots). All in all, a ma-\njor tragedy occurred due to a complex mixture of social pressures \nand logical explaining away of discrepant observations.\nYou may have experienced similar pressure, putting off refuel-\ning or recharging your car until it was too late and you ran out, \nsometimes in a truly inconvenient place (this has happened to me). \nWhat are the social pressures to cheat on school examinations, or \nto help others cheat? Or to not report cheating by others? Never \nunderestimate the power of social pressures on behavior, causing \notherwise sensible people to do things they know are wrong and \npossibly dangerous.\nWhen I was in training to do underwater (scuba) diving, our in-\nstructor was so concerned about this that he said he would reward \nanyone who stopped a dive early in favor of safety. People are nor-\nmally buoyant, so they need weights to get them beneath the surface. \nWhen the water is cold, the problem is intensified because divers \nmust then wear either wet or dry suits to keep warm, and these \nsuits add buoyancy. Adjusting buoyancy is an important part of \nthe dive, so along with the weights, divers also wear air vests \ninto which they continually add or remove air so that the body is \nclose to neutral buoyancy. (As divers go deeper, increased water \npressure compresses the air in their protective suits and lungs, so \nthey become heavier: the divers need to add air to their vests to \ncompensate.)\n\n\n188 The Design of Everyday Things\nWhen divers have gotten into difficulties and needed to get \nto the surface quickly, or when they were at the surface close to \nshore but being tossed around by waves, some drowned because \nthey were still being encumbered by their heavy weights. Because the \nweights are expensive, the divers didn’t want to release them. In \naddition, if the divers released the weights and then made it back \nsafely, they could never prove that the release of the weights was \nnecessary, so they would feel embarrassed, creating self-induced \nsocial pressure. Our instructor was very aware of the resulting re-\nluctance of people to take the critical step of releasing their weights \nwhen they weren’t entirely positive it was necessary. To counteract \nthis tendency, he announced that if anyone dropped the weights \nfor safety reasons, he would publicly praise the diver and replace \nthe weights at no cost to the person. This was a very persuasive \nattempt to overcome social pressures.\nSocial pressures show up continually. They are usually difficult \nto document because most people and organizations are reluctant \nto admit these factors, so even if they are discovered in the process \nof the accident investigation, the results are often kept hidden from \npublic scrutiny. A major exception is in the study of transportation \naccidents, where the review boards across the world tend to hold \nopen investigations. The US National Transportation Safety Board \n(NTSB) is an excellent example of this, and its reports are widely \nused by many accident investigators and researchers of human er-\nror (including me).\nAnother good example of social pressures comes from yet an-\nother airplane incident. In 1982 an Air Florida flight from National \nAirport, Washington, DC, crashed during takeoff into the Four-\nteenth Street Bridge over the Potomac River, killing seventy-eight \npeople, including four who were on the bridge. The plane should \nnot have taken off because there was ice on the wings, but it had al-\nready been delayed for over an hour and a half; this and other fac-\ntors, the NTSB reported, “may have predisposed the crew to hurry.” \nThe accident occurred despite the first officer’s attempt to warn \nthe captain, who was flying the airplane (the captain and first \nofficer—sometimes called the copilot—usually alternate flying \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 189\nroles on different legs of a trip). The NTSB report quotes the flight \ndeck recorder’s documenting that “although the first officer ex-\npressed concern that something ‘was not right’ to the captain four \ntimes during the takeoff, the captain took no action to reject the \ntakeoff.” NTSB summarized the causes this way:\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable \ncause of this accident was the flight crew’s failure to use engine anti-\nice during ground operation and takeoff, their decision to take off with \nsnow/ice on the airfoil surfaces of the aircraft, and the captain’s failure \nto reject the takeoff during the early stage when his attention was called \nto anomalous engine instrument readings. (NTSB, 1982.)\nAgain we see social pressures coupled with time and economic \nforces.\nSocial pressures can be overcome, but they are powerful and per-\nvasive. We drive when drowsy or after drinking, knowing full well \nthe dangers, but talking ourselves into believing that we are ex-\nempt. How can we overcome these kinds of social problems? Good \ndesign alone is not sufficient. We need different training; we need \nto reward safety and put it above economic pressures. It helps if \nthe equipment can make the potential dangers visible and explicit, \nbut this is not always possible. To adequately address social, eco-\nnomic, and cultural pressures and to improve upon company pol-\nicies are the hardest parts of ensuring safe operation and behavior.\nCHECKLISTS\nChecklists are powerful tools, proven to increase the accuracy of \nbehavior and to reduce error, particularly slips and memory lapses. \nThey are especially important in situations with multiple, complex \nrequirements, and even more so where there are interruptions. \nWith multiple people involved in a task, it is essential that the lines \nof responsibility be clearly spelled out. It is always better to have \ntwo people do checklists together as a team: one to read the instruc-\ntion, the other to execute it. If, instead, a single person executes \nthe checklist and then, later, a second person checks the items, the \n\n\n190 The Design of Everyday Things\nresults are not as robust. The person following the checklist, feel-\ning confident that any errors would be caught, might do the steps \ntoo quickly. But the same bias affects the checker. Confident in the \nability of the first person, the checker often does a quick, less than \nthorough job.\nOne paradox of groups is that quite often, adding more people \nto check a task makes it less likely that it will be done right. Why? \nWell, if you were responsible for checking the correct readings on \na row of fifty gauges and displays, but you know that two peo-\nple before you had checked them and that one or two people who \ncome after you will check your work, you might relax, thinking \nthat you don’t have to be extra careful. After all, with so many \npeople looking, it would be impossible for a problem to exist with-\nout detection. But if everyone thinks the same way, adding more \nchecks can actually increase the chance of error. A collaboratively \nfollowed checklist is an effective way to counteract these natural \nhuman tendencies.\nIn commercial aviation, collaboratively followed checklists are \nwidely accepted as essential tools for safety. The checklist is done \nby two people, usually the two pilots of the airplane (the captain \nand first officer). In aviation, checklists have proven their worth \nand are now required in all US commercial flights. But despite the \nstrong evidence confirming their usefulness, many industries still \nfiercely resist them. It makes people feel that their competence is \nbeing questioned. Moreover, when two people are involved, a ju-\nnior person (in aviation, the first officer) is being asked to watch \nover the action of the senior person. This is a strong violation of the \nlines of authority in many cultures.\nPhysicians and other medical professionals have strongly resisted \nthe use of checklists. It is seen as an insult to their professional \ncompetence. “Other people might need checklists,” they complain, \n“but not me.” Too bad. Too err is human: we all are subject to slips \nand mistakes when under stress, or under time or social pressure, \nor after being subjected to multiple interruptions, each essential \nin its own right. It is not a threat to professional competence to be \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n191\nhuman. Legitimate criticisms of particular checklists are used as an \nindictment against the concept of checklists. Fortunately, checklists \nare slowly starting to gain acceptance in medical situations. When \nsenior personnel insist on the use of checklists, it actually enhances \ntheir authority and professional status. It took decades for check-\nlists to be accepted in commercial aviation: let us hope that medi-\ncine and other professions will change more rapidly.\nDesigning an effective checklist is difficult. The design needs to be \niterative, always being refined, ideally using the human-centered \ndesign principles of Chapter 6, continually adjusting the list until it \ncovers the essential items yet is not burdensome to perform. Many \npeople who object to checklists are actually objecting to badly de-\nsigned lists: designing a checklist for a complex task is best done by \nprofessional designers in conjunction with subject matter experts.\nPrinted checklists have one major flaw: they force the steps to \nfollow a sequential ordering, even where this is not necessary or \neven possible. With complex tasks, the order in which many oper-\nations are performed may not matter, as long as they are all com-\npleted. Sometimes items early in the list cannot be done at the time \nthey are encountered in the checklist. For example, in aviation one \nof the steps is to check the amount of fuel in the plane. But what if \nthe fueling operation has not yet been completed when this check-\nlist item is encountered? Pilots will skip over it, intending to come \nback to it after the plane has been refueled. This is a clear opportu-\nnity for a memory-lapse error.\nIn general, it is bad design to impose a sequential structure to task \nexecution unless the task itself requires it. This is one of the ma-\njor benefits of electronic checklists: they can keep track of skipped \nitems and can ensure that the list will not be marked as complete \nuntil all items have been done.\nReporting Error\nIf errors can be caught, then many of the problems they might lead \nto can often be avoided. But not all errors are easy to detect. More-\nover, social pressures often make it difficult for people to admit to \n\n\n192 The Design of Everyday Things\ntheir own errors (or to report the errors of others). If people report \ntheir own errors, they might be fined or punished. Moreover, their \nfriends may make fun of them. If a person reports that someone \nelse made an error, this may lead to severe personal repercussions. \nFinally, most institutions do not wish to reveal errors made by their \nstaff. Hospitals, courts, police systems, utility companies—all are \nreluctant to admit to the public that their workers are capable of \nerror. These are all unfortunate attitudes.\nThe only way to reduce the incidence of errors is to admit their \nexistence, to gather together information about them, and thereby \nto be able to make the appropriate changes to reduce their occur-\nrence. In the absence of data, it is difficult or impossible to make \nimprovements. Rather than stigmatize those who admit to error, \nwe should thank those who do so and encourage the reporting. \nWe need to make it easier to report errors, for the goal is not to \npunish, but to determine how it occurred and change things so \nthat it will not happen again.\nCASE STUDY: JIDOKA—HOW TOYOTA HANDLES ERROR\nThe Toyota automobile company has developed an extremely effi-\ncient error-reduction process for manufacturing, widely known as \nthe Toyota Production System. Among its many key principles is a \nphilosophy called Jidoka, which Toyota says is “roughly translated \nas ‘automation with a human touch.’” If a worker notices some-\nthing wrong, the worker is supposed to report it, sometimes even \nstopping the entire assembly line if a faulty part is about to pro-\nceed to the next station. (A special cord, called an andon, stops the \nassembly line and alerts the expert crew.) Experts converge upon \nthe problem area to determine the cause. “Why did it happen?” \n“Why was that?” “Why is that the reason?” The philosophy is to \nask “Why?” as many times as may be necessary to get to the root \ncause of the problem and then fix it so it can never occur again.\nAs you might imagine, this can be rather discomforting for the \nperson who found the error. But the report is expected, and when \nit is discovered that people have failed to report errors, they are \npunished, all in an attempt to get the workers to be honest.\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 193\nPOKA-YOKE: ERROR PROOFING \nPoka-yoke is another Japanese method, this one invented by Shi-\ngeo Shingo, one of the Japanese engineers who played a major role \nin the development of the Toyota Production System. Poka-yoke \ntranslates as “error proofing” or “avoiding error.” One of the tech-\nniques of poka-yoke is to add simple fixtures, jigs, or devices to \nconstrain the operations so that they are correct. I practice this my-\nself in my home. One trivial example is a device to help me remem-\nber which way to turn the key on the many doors in the apartment \ncomplex where I live. I went around with a pile of small, circular, \ngreen stick-on dots and put them on each door beside its keyhole, \nwith the green dot indicating the direction in which the key needed \nto be turned: I added signifiers to the doors. Is this a major error? \nNo. But eliminating it has proven to be convenient. (Neighbors \nhave commented on their utility, wondering who put them there.)\nIn manufacturing facilities, poka-yoke might be a piece of wood \nto help align a part properly, or perhaps plates designed with \nasymmetrical screw holes so that the plate could fit in only one po-\nsition. Covering emergency or critical switches with a cover to pre-\nvent accidental triggering is another poka-yoke technique: this is \nobviously a forcing function. All the poka-yoke techniques involve \na combination of the principles discussed in this book: affordances, \nsignifiers, mapping, and constraints, and perhaps most important \nof all, forcing functions.\nNASA’S AVIATION SAFETY REPORTING SYSTEM\nUS commercial aviation has long had an extremely effective sys-\ntem for encouraging pilots to submit reports of errors. The pro-\ngram has resulted in numerous improvements to aviation safety. \nIt wasn’t easy to establish: pilots had severe self-induced social \npressures against admitting to errors. Moreover, to whom would \nthey report them? Certainly not to their employers. Not even to the \nFederal Aviation Authority (FAA), for then they would probably \nbe punished. The solution was to let the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration (NASA) set up a voluntary accident report-\ning system whereby pilots could submit semi-anonymous reports \n",

Once \nNASA personnel had acquired the necessary information, they \nwould detach the contact information from the report and mail it \nback to the pilot. This meant that NASA no longer knew who had \nreported the error, which made it impossible for the airline com-\npanies or the FAA (which enforced penalties against errors) to find \nout who had submitted the report. If the FAA had independently \nnoticed the error and tried to invoke a civil penalty or certificate \nsuspension, the receipt of self-report automatically exempted the \npilot from punishment (for minor infractions).\nWhen a sufficient number of similar errors had been collected, \nNASA would analyze them and issue reports and recommenda-\ntions to the airlines and to the FAA. These reports also helped \nthe pilots realize that their error reports were valuable tools for \nincreasing safety. As with checklists, we need similar systems in \nthe field of medicine, but it has not been easy to set up. NASA is a \nneutral body, charged with enhancing aviation safety, but has no \noversight authority, which helped gain the trust of pilots. There is \nno comparable institution in medicine: physicians are afraid that \nself-reported errors might lead them to lose their license or be sub-\njected to lawsuits. But we can’t eliminate errors unless we know \nwhat they are. The medical field is starting to make progress, but it \nis a difficult technical, political, legal, and social problem.\nDetecting Error\nErrors do not necessarily lead to harm if they are discovered \nquickly. The different categories of errors have differing ease of \ndiscovery. In general, action slips are relatively easy to discover; \nmistakes, much more difficult. Action slips are relatively easy to \ndetect because it is usually easy to notice a discrepancy between \nthe intended act and the one that got performed. But this detection \ncan only take place if there is feedback. If the result of the action is \nnot visible, how can the error be detected?\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 195\nMemory-lapse slips are difficult to detect precisely because there \nis nothing to see. With a memory slip, the required action is not \nperformed. When no action is done, there is nothing to detect. It is \nonly when the lack of action allows some unwanted event to occur \nthat there is hope of detecting a memory-lapse slip.\nMistakes are difficult to detect because there is seldom anything \nthat can signal an inappropriate goal. And once the wrong goal or \nplan is decided upon, the resulting actions are consistent with that \nwrong goal, so careful monitoring of the actions not only fails to de-\ntect the erroneous goal, but, because the actions are done correctly, \ncan inappropriately provide added confidence to the decision.\nFaulty diagnoses of a situation can be surprisingly difficult to \ndetect. You might expect that if the diagnosis was wrong, the ac-\ntions would turn out to be ineffective, so the fault would be discov-\nered quickly. But misdiagnoses are not random. Usually they are \nbased on considerable knowledge and logic. The misdiagnosis is \nusually both reasonable and relevant to eliminating the symptoms \nbeing observed. As a result, the initial actions are apt to appear ap-\npropriate and helpful. This makes the problem of discovery even \nmore difficult. The actual error might not be discovered for hours \nor days. \nMemory-lapse mistakes are especially difficult to detect. Just as \nwith a memory-lapse slip the absence of something that should \nhave been done is always more difficult to detect than the presence \nof something that should not have been done. The difference be-\ntween memory-lapse slips and mistakes is that, in the first case, a \nsingle component of a plan is skipped, whereas in the second, the \nentire plan is forgotten. Which is easier to discover? At this point \nI must retreat to the standard answer science likes to give to ques-\ntions of this sort: “It all depends.”\nEXPLAINING AWAY MISTAKES\nMistakes can take a long time to be discovered. Hear a noise that \nsounds like a pistol shot and think: “Must be a car’s exhaust back-\nfiring.” Hear someone yell outside and think: “Why can’t my \n\n\n196 The Design of Everyday Things\nneighbors be quiet?” Are we correct in dismissing these incidents? \nMost of the time we are, but when we’re not, our explanations can \nbe difficult to justify.\nExplaining away errors is a common problem in commercial \naccidents. Most major accidents are preceded by warning signs: \nequipment malfunctions or unusual events. Often, there is a series \nof apparently unrelated breakdowns and errors that culminate in \nmajor disaster. Why didn’t anyone notice? Because no single in-\ncident appeared to be serious. Often, the people involved noted \neach problem but discounted it, finding a logical explanation for \nthe otherwise deviant observation.\nT HE CASE OF T HE W RONG T U R N ON A HIGH WAY\nI’ve misinterpreted highway signs, as I’m sure most drivers have. \nMy family was traveling from San Diego to Mammoth Lakes, Cal-\nifornia, a ski area about 400 miles north. As we drove, we noticed \nmore and more signs advertising the hotels and gambling casinos \nof Las Vegas, Nevada. “Strange,” we said, “Las Vegas always did \nadvertise a long way off—there is even a billboard in San Diego—\nbut this seems excessive, advertising on the road to Mammoth.” \nWe stopped for gasoline and continued on our journey. Only later, \nwhen we tried to find a place to eat supper, did we discover that we \nhad missed a turn nearly two hours earlier, before we had stopped \nfor gasoline, and that we were actually on the road to Las Vegas, \nnot the road to Mammoth. We had to backtrack the entire two-\nhour segment, wasting four hours of driving. It’s humorous now; \nit wasn’t then.\nOnce people find an explanation for an apparent anomaly, they \ntend to believe they can now discount it. But explanations are \nbased on analogy with past experiences, experiences that may not \napply to the current situation. In the driving story, the prevalence \nof billboards for Las Vegas was a signal we should have heeded, \nbut it seemed easily explained. Our experience is typical: some \nmajor industrial incidents have resulted from false explanations of \nanomalous events. But do note: usually these apparent anomalies \nshould be ignored. Most of the time, the explanation for their pres-\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 197\nence is correct. Distinguishing a true anomaly from an apparent \none is difficult.\nIN HINDSIGHT, EVENTS SEEM LOGICAL\nThe contrast in our understanding before and after an event can be \ndramatic. The psychologist Baruch Fischhoff has studied explana-\ntions given in hindsight, where events seem completely obvious and \npredictable after the fact but completely unpredictable beforehand.\nFischhoff presented people with a number of situations and \nasked them to predict what would happen: they were correct only \nat the chance level. When the actual outcome was not known by the \npeople being studied, few predicted the actual outcome. He then \npresented the same situations along with the actual outcomes to \nanother group of people, asking them to state how likely each out-\ncome was: when the actual outcome was known, it appeared to be \nplausible and likely and other outcomes appeared unlikely.\nHindsight makes events seem obvious and predictable. Foresight \nis difficult. During an incident, there are never clear clues. Many \nthings are happening at once: workload is high, emotions and \nstress levels are high. Many things that are happening will turn \nout to be irrelevant. Things that appear irrelevant will turn out \nto be critical. The accident investigators, working with hindsight, \nknowing what really happened, will focus on the relevant infor-\nmation and ignore the irrelevant. But at the time the events were \nhappening, the operators did not have information that allowed \nthem to distinguish one from the other.\nThis is why the best accident analyses can take a long time to \ndo. The investigators have to imagine themselves in the shoes of \nthe people who were involved and consider all the information, \nall the training, and what the history of similar past events would \nhave taught the operators. So, the next time a major accident oc-\ncurs, ignore the initial reports from journalists, politicians, and \nexecutives who don’t have any substantive information but feel \ncompelled to provide statements anyway. Wait until the official \nreports come from trusted sources. Unfortunately, this could be \nmonths or years after the accident, and the public usually wants \n\n\n198 The Design of Everyday Things\nanswers immediately, even if those answers are wrong. Moreover, \nwhen the full story finally appears, newspapers will no longer con-\nsider it news, so they won’t report it. You will have to search for \nthe official report. In the United States, the National Transportation \nSafety Board (NTSB) can be trusted. NTSB conducts careful inves-\ntigations of all major aviation, automobile and truck, train, ship, \nand pipeline incidents. (Pipelines? Sure: pipelines transport coal, \ngas, and oil.)\nDesigning for Error\nIt is relatively easy to design for the situation where everything \ngoes well, where people use the device in the way that was in-\ntended, and no unforeseen events occur. The tricky part is to de-\nsign for when things go wrong.\nConsider a conversation between two people. Are errors made? \nYes, but they are not treated as such. If a person says something \nthat is not understandable, we ask for clarification. If a person says \nsomething that we believe to be false, we question and debate. We \ndon’t issue a warning signal. We don’t beep. We don’t give error \nmessages. We ask for more information and engage in mutual dia-\nlogue to reach an understanding. In normal conversations between \ntwo friends, misstatements are taken as normal, as approximations \nto what was really meant. Grammatical errors, self-corrections, and \nrestarted phrases are ignored. In fact, they are usually not even \ndetected because we concentrate upon the intended meaning, not \nthe surface features.\nMachines are not intelligent enough to determine the meaning \nof our actions, but even so, they are far less intelligent than they \ncould be. With our products, if we do something inappropriate, \nif the action fits the proper format for a command, the product \ndoes it, even if it is outrageously dangerous. This has led to tragic \naccidents, especially in health care, where inappropriate design of \ninfusion pumps and X-ray machines allowed extreme overdoses \nof medication or radiation to be administered to patients, leading \nto their deaths. In financial institutions, simple keyboard errors \nhave led to huge financial transactions, far beyond normal limits. \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 199\nEven simple checks for reasonableness would have stopped all of \nthese errors. (This is discussed at the end of the chapter under the \nheading “Sensibility Checks.”)\nMany systems compound the problem by making it easy to err \nbut difficult or impossible to discover error or to recover from it. \nIt should not be possible for one simple error to cause widespread \ndamage. Here is what should be done:\n•  Understand the causes of error and design to minimize those causes.\n•  Do sensibility checks. Does the action pass the “common sense” test?\n•  Make it possible to reverse actions—to “undo” them—or make it \nharder to do what cannot be reversed.\n•  Make it easier for people to discover the errors that do occur, and \nmake them easier to correct.\n•  Don’t treat the action as an error; rather, try to help the person com-\nplete the action properly. Think of the action as an approximation to \nwhat is desired.\nAs this chapter demonstrates, we know a lot about errors. Thus, \nnovices are more likely to make mistakes than slips, whereas experts \nare more likely to make slips. Mistakes often arise from ambiguous \nor unclear information about the current state of a system, the lack \nof a good conceptual model, and inappropriate procedures. Recall \nthat most mistakes result from erroneous choice of goal or plan or \nerroneous evaluation and interpretation. All of these come about \nthrough poor information provided by the system about the choice \nof goals and the means to accomplish them (plans), and poor-quality \nfeedback about what has actually happened.\nA major source of error, especially memory-lapse errors, is in-\nterruption. When an activity is interrupted by some other event, \nthe cost of the interruption is far greater than the loss of the time \nrequired to deal with the interruption: it is also the cost of resuming \nthe interrupted activity. To resume, it is necessary to remember pre-\ncisely the previous state of the activity: what the goal was, where \none was in the action cycle, and the relevant state of the system. \nMost systems make it difficult to resume after an interruption. \n\n\n200 The Design of Everyday Things\nMost discard critical information that is needed by the user to re-\nmember the numerous small decisions that had been made, the \nthings that were in the person’s short-term memory, to say noth-\ning of the current state of the system. What still needs to be done? \nMaybe I was finished? It is no wonder that many slips and mis-\ntakes are the result of interruptions.\nMultitasking, whereby we deliberately do several tasks simul-\ntaneously, erroneously appears to be an efficient way of getting a \nlot done. It is much beloved by teenagers and busy workers, but in \nfact, all the evidence points to severe degradation of performance, \nincreased errors, and a general lack of both quality and efficiency. \nDoing two tasks at once takes longer than the sum of the times it \nwould take to do each alone. Even as simple and common a task \nas talking on a hands-free cell phone while driving leads to seri-\nous degradation of driving skills. One study even showed that cell \nphone usage during walking led to serious deficits: “Cell phone \nusers walked more slowly, changed directions more frequently, \nand were less likely to acknowledge other people than individuals \nin the other conditions. In the second study, we found that cell \nphone users were less likely to notice an unusual activity along \ntheir walking route (a unicycling clown)” (Hyman, Boss, Wise, \nMcKenzie, & Caggiano, 2010).\nA large percentage of medical errors are due to interruptions. \nIn aviation, where interruptions were also determined to be a \nmajor problem during the critical phases of flying—landing and \ntakeoff—the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) requires what \nit calls a “Sterile Cockpit Configuration,” whereby pilots are not \nallowed to discuss any topic not directly related to the control of \nthe airplane during these critical periods. In addition, the flight at-\ntendants are not permitted to talk to the pilots during these phases \n(which has at times led to the opposite error—failure to inform the \npilots of emergency situations).\nEstablishing similar sterile periods would be of great benefit to \nmany professions, including medicine and other safety-critical \noperations. My wife and I follow this convention in driving: when \nthe driver is entering or leaving a high-speed highway, conversa-\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 201\ntion ceases until the transition has been completed. Interruptions \nand distractions lead to errors, both mistakes and slips.\nWarning signals are usually not the answer. Consider the control \nroom of a nuclear power plant, the cockpit of a commercial aircraft, \nor the operating room of a hospital. Each has a large number of \ndifferent instruments, gauges, and controls, all with signals that \ntend to sound similar because they all use simple tone generators \nto beep their warnings. There is no coordination among the instru-\nments, which means that in major emergencies, they all sound at \nonce. Most can be ignored anyway because they tell the operator \nabout something that is already known. Each competes with the \nothers to be heard, interfering with efforts to address the problem.\nUnnecessary, annoying alarms occur in numerous situations. \nHow do people cope? By disconnecting warning signals, taping \nover warning lights (or removing the bulbs), silencing bells, and \nbasically getting rid of all the safety warnings. The problem comes \nafter such alarms are disabled, either when people forget to restore \nthe warning systems (there are those memory-lapse slips again), or \nif a different incident happens while the alarms are disconnected. \nAt that point, nobody notices. Warnings and safety methods must \nbe used with care and intelligence, taking into account the tradeoffs \nfor the people who are affected.\nThe design of warning signals is surprisingly complex. They \nhave to be loud or bright enough to be noticed, but not so loud or \nbright that they become annoying distractions. The signal has to \nboth attract attention (act as a signifier of critical information) and \nalso deliver information about the nature of the event that is being \nsignified. The various instruments need to have a coordinated re-\nsponse, which means that there must be international standards \nand collaboration among the many design teams from different, \noften competing, companies. Although considerable research has \nbeen directed toward this problem, including the development of \nnational standards for alarm management systems, the problem \nstill remains in many situations.\nMore and more of our machines present information through \nspeech. But like all approaches, this has both strengths and \n",

It allows for precise information to be conveyed, es-\npecially when the person’s visual attention is directed elsewhere. \nBut if several speech warnings operate at the same time, or if the \nenvironment is noisy, speech warnings may not be understood. Or \nif conversations among the users or operators are necessary, speech \nwarnings will interfere. Speech warning signals can be effective, \nbut only if used intelligently.\nDESIGN LESSONS FROM THE STUDY OF ERRORS\nSeveral design lessons can be drawn from the study of errors, one \nfor preventing errors before they occur and one for detecting and \ncorrecting them when they do occur. In general, the solutions fol-\nlow directly from the preceding analyses.\nADDING CONST R A IN TS TO BLOC K ER RORS\nPrevention often involves adding specific constraints to actions. In \nthe physical world, this can be done through clever use of shape \nand size. For example, in automobiles, a variety of fluids are re-\nquired for safe operation and maintenance: engine oil, transmis-\nsion oil, brake fluid, windshield washer solution, radiator coolant, \nbattery water, and gasoline. Putting the wrong fluid into a reser-\nvoir could lead to serious damage or even an accident. Automobile \nmanufacturers try to minimize these errors by segregating the fill-\ning points, thereby reducing description-similarity errors. When \nthe filling points for fluids that should be added only occasion-\nally or by qualified mechanics are located separately from those \nfor fluids used more frequently, the average motorist is unlikely \nto use the incorrect filling points. Errors in adding fluids to the \nwrong container can be minimized by making the openings have \ndifferent sizes and shapes, providing physical constraints against \ninappropriate filling. Different fluids often have different colors so \nthat they can be distinguished. All these are excellent ways to min-\nimize errors. Similar techniques are in widespread use in hospitals \nand industry. All of these are intelligent applications of constraints, \nforcing functions, and poka-yoke.\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 203\nElectronic systems have a wide range of methods that could be \nused to reduce error. One is to segregate controls, so that easily \nconfused controls are located far from one another. Another is \nto use separate modules, so that any control not directly relevant \nto the current operation is not visible on the screen, but requires \nextra effort to get to.\nU NDO\nPerhaps the most powerful tool to minimize the impact of errors \nis the Undo command in modern electronic systems, reversing the \noperations performed by the previous command, wherever pos-\nsible. The best systems have multiple levels of undoing, so it is \npossible to undo an entire sequence of actions.\nObviously, undoing is not always possible. Sometimes, it is only \neffective if done immediately after the action. Still, it is a power-\nful tool to minimize the impact of error. It is still amazing to me \nthat many electronic and computer-based systems fail to provide \na means to undo even where it is clearly possible and desirable.\nCON F IR M AT ION A ND ER ROR M ESSAGES\nMany systems try to prevent errors by requiring confirmation be-\nfore a command will be executed, especially when the action will \ndestroy something of importance. But these requests are usually \nill-timed because after requesting an operation, people are usu-\nally certain they want it done. Hence the standard joke about such \nwarnings:\nPerson: Delete “my most important file.”\nSystem: Do you want to delete “my most important file”?\nPerson: Yes.\nSystem: Are you certain?\nPerson: Yes!\nSystem “My most favorite file” has been deleted.\nPerson: Oh. Damn.\n\n\n204 The Design of Everyday Things\nThe request for confirmation seems like an irritant rather than \nan essential safety check because the person tends to focus upon \nthe action rather than the object that is being acted upon. A bet-\nter check would be a prominent display of both the action to be \ntaken and the object, perhaps with the choice of “cancel” or “do \nit.” The important point is making salient what the implications of \nthe action are. Of course, it is because of errors of this sort that the \nUndo command is so important. With traditional graphical user \ninterfaces on computers, not only is Undo a standard command, \nbut when files are “deleted,” they are actually simply moved from \nsight and stored in the file folder named “Trash,” so that in the \nabove example, the person could open the Trash and retrieve the \nerroneously deleted file.\nConfirmations have different implications for slips and mistakes. \nWhen I am writing, I use two very large displays and a powerful \ncomputer. I might have seven to ten applications running simul-\ntaneously. I have sometimes had as many as forty open windows. \nSuppose I activate the command that closes one of the windows, \nwhich triggers a confirmatory message: did I wish to close the win-\ndow? How I deal with this depends upon why I requested that the \nwindow be closed. If it was a slip, the confirmation required will \nbe useful. If it was by mistake, I am apt to ignore it. Consider these \ntwo examples:\nA slip leads me to close the wrong window.\nSuppose I intended to type the word We, but instead of typing \nShift + W for the first character, I typed Command + W (or Con-\ntrol + W), the keyboard command for closing a window. Because \nI expected the screen to display an uppercase W, when a dialog \nbox appeared, asking whether I really wanted to delete the file, I \nwould be surprised, which would immediately alert me to the slip. \nI would cancel the action (an alternative thoughtfully provided by \nthe dialog box) and retype the Shift + W, carefully this time.\nA mistake leads me to close the wrong window.\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 205\nNow suppose I really intended to close a window. I often use a \ntemporary file in a window to keep notes about the chapter I am \nworking on. When I am finished with it, I close it without saving its \ncontents—after all, I am finished. But because I usually have multi-\nple windows open, it is very easy to close the wrong one. The com-\nputer assumes that all commands apply to the active window—the \none where the last actions had been performed (and which contains \nthe text cursor). But if I reviewed the temporary window prior to \nclosing it, my visual attention is focused upon that window, and \nwhen I decide to close it, I forget that it is not the active window \nfrom the computer’s point of view. So I issue the command to shut \nthe window, the computer presents me with a dialog box, asking \nfor confirmation, and I accept it, choosing the option not to save \nmy work. Because the dialog box was expected, I didn’t bother to \nread it. As a result, I closed the wrong window and worse, did not \nsave any of the typing, possibly losing considerable work. Warning \nmessages are surprisingly ineffective against mistakes (even nice \nrequests, such as the one shown in Chapter 4, Figure 4.6, page 143).\nWas this a mistake or a slip? Both. Issuing the “close” command \nwhile the wrong window was active is a memory-lapse slip. But \ndeciding not to read the dialog box and accepting it without saving \nthe contents is a mistake (two mistakes, actually).\nWhat can a designer do? Several things:\n•  Make the item being acted upon more prominent. That is, change \nthe appearance of the actual object being acted upon to be more visi-\nble: enlarge it, or perhaps change its color.\n•  Make the operation reversible. If the person saves the content, no \nharm is done except the annoyance of having to reopen the file. If the \nperson elects Don’t Save, the system could secretly save the contents, \nand the next time the person opened the file, it could ask whether it \nshould restore it to the latest condition.\nSENSIBILITY CHECKS\nElectronic systems have another advantage over mechanical ones: \nthey can check to make sure that the requested operation is sensible.\n\n\n206 The Design of Everyday Things\nIt is amazing that in today’s world, medical personnel can ac-\ncidentally request a radiation dose a thousand times larger than \nnormal and have the equipment meekly comply. In some cases, it \nisn’t even possible for the operator to notice the error.\nSimilarly, errors in stating monetary sums can lead to disastrous \nresults, even though a quick glance at the amount would indicate \nthat something was badly off. For example, there are roughly 1,000 \nKorean won to the US dollar. Suppose I wanted to transfer $1,000 \ninto a Korean bank account in won ($1,000 is roughly ₩1,000,000). \nBut suppose I enter the Korean number into the dollar field. \nOops—I’m trying to transfer a million dollars. Intelligent systems \nwould take note of the normal size of my transactions, query-\ning if the amount was considerably larger than normal. For me, it \nwould query the million-dollar request. Less intelligent systems \nwould blindly follow instructions, even though I did not have a \nmillion dollars in my account (in fact, I would probably be charged \na fee for overdrawing my account).\nSensibility checks, of course, are also the answer to the serious \nerrors caused when inappropriate values are entered into hospital \nmedication and X-ray systems or in financial transactions, as dis-\ncussed earlier in this chapter.\nMINIMIZING SLIPS\nSlips most frequently occur when the conscious mind is distracted, \neither by some other event or simply because the action being per-\nformed is so well learned that it can be done automatically, without \nconscious attention. As a result, the person does not pay sufficient \nattention to the action or its consequences. It might therefore seem \nthat one way to minimize slips is to ensure that people always pay \nclose, conscious attention to the acts being done.\nBad idea. Skilled behavior is subconscious, which means it is \nfast, effortless, and usually accurate. Because it is so automatic, we \ncan type at high speeds even while the conscious mind is occupied \ncomposing the words. This is why we can walk and talk while nav-\nigating traffic and obstacles. If we had to pay conscious attention \nto every little thing we did, we would accomplish far less in our \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 207\nlives. The information processing structures of the brain automat-\nically regulate how much conscious attention is being paid to a \ntask: conversations automatically pause when crossing the street \namid busy traffic. Don’t count on it, though: if too much attention \nis focused on something else, the fact that the traffic is getting dan-\ngerous might not be noted.\nMany slips can be minimized by ensuring that the actions and \ntheir controls are as dissimilar as possible, or at least, as physically \nfar apart as possible. Mode errors can be eliminated by the simple \nexpedient of eliminating most modes and, if this is not possible, \nby making the modes very visible and distinct from one another.\nThe best way of mitigating slips is to provide perceptible feed-\nback about the nature of the action being performed, then very \nperceptible feedback describing the new resulting state, coupled \nwith a mechanism that allows the error to be undone. For example, \nthe use of machine-readable codes has led to a dramatic reduction \nin the delivery of wrong medications to patients. Prescriptions sent \nto the pharmacy are given electronic codes, so the pharmacist can \nscan both the prescription and the resulting medication to ensure \nthey are the same. Then, the nursing staff at the hospital scans both \nthe label of the medication and the tag worn around the patient’s \nwrist to ensure that the medication is being given to the correct \nindividual. Moreover, the computer system can flag repeated ad-\nministration of the same medication. These scans do increase the \nworkload, but only slightly. Other kinds of errors are still possible, \nbut these simple steps have already been proven worthwhile.\nCommon engineering and design practices seem as if they are \ndeliberately intended to cause slips. Rows of identical controls or \nmeters is a sure recipe for description-similarity errors. Internal \nmodes that are not very conspicuously marked are a clear driver \nof mode errors. Situations with numerous interruptions, yet where \nthe design assumes undivided attention, are a clear enabler of \nmemory lapses—and almost no equipment today is designed to \nsupport the numerous interruptions that so many situations en-\ntail. And failure to provide assistance and visible reminders for \nperforming infrequent procedures that are similar to much more \n\n\n208 The Design of Everyday Things\nfrequent ones leads to capture errors, where the more frequent ac-\ntions are performed rather than the correct ones for the situation. \nProcedures should be designed so that the initial steps are as dis-\nsimilar as possible.\nThe important message is that good design can prevent slips and \nmistakes. Design can save lives.\nTHE SWISS CHEESE MODEL OF \nHOW ERRORS LEAD TO ACCIDENTS\nFortunately, most errors do not lead to accidents. Accidents often \nhave numerous contributing causes, no single one of which is the \nroot cause of the incident.\nJames Reason likes to explain this by invoking the metaphor of \nmultiple slices of Swiss cheese, the cheese famous for being riddled \nwith holes (Figure 5.3). If each slice of cheese represents a condi-\ntion in the task being done, an accident can happen only if holes \nin all four slices of cheese are lined up just right. In well-designed \nsystems, there can be many equipment failures, many errors, but \nthey will not lead to an accident unless they all line up precisely. \nAny leakage—passageway through a hole—is most likely blocked \nat the next level. Well-designed systems are resilient against failure.\nThis is why the attempt to find \n“the” cause of an accident is usually \ndoomed to fail. Accident investiga-\ntors, the press, government officials, \nand the everyday citizen like to find \nsimple explanations for the cause of \nan accident. “See, if the hole in slice A \nFIGURE 5.3. Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model of Accidents. Accidents usually have \nmultiple causes, whereby had any single one of those causes not happened, the acci-\ndent would not have occurred. The British accident researcher James Reason describes \nthis through the metaphor of slices of Swiss cheese: unless the holes all line up per-\nfectly, there will be no accident. This metaphor provides two lessons: First, do not try \nto find “the” cause of an accident; Second, we can decrease accidents and make sys-\ntems more resilient by designing them to have extra precautions against error (more \nslices of cheese), less opportunities for slips, mistakes, or equipment failure (less holes), \nand very different mechanisms in the different subparts of the system (trying to en-\nsure that the holes do not line up). (Drawing based upon one by Reason, 1990.)\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design 209\nhad been slightly higher, we would not have had the accident. So \nthrow away slice A and replace it.” Of course, the same can be said \nfor slices B, C, and D (and in real accidents, the number of cheese \nslices would sometimes measure in the tens or hundreds). It is rel-\natively easy to find some action or decision that, had it been dif-\nferent, would have prevented the accident. But that does not mean \nthat this was the cause of the accident. It is only one of the many \ncauses: all the items have to line up.\nYou can see this in most accidents by the “if only” statements. \n“If only I hadn’t decided to take a shortcut, I wouldn’t have had \nthe accident.” “If only it hadn’t been raining, my brakes would \nhave worked.” “If only I had looked to the left, I would have seen \nthe car sooner.” Yes, all those statements are true, but none of them \nis “the” cause of the accident. Usually, there is no single cause. \nYes, journalists and lawyers, as well as the public, like to know \nthe cause so someone can be blamed and punished. But reputable \ninvestigating agencies know that there is not a single cause, which \nis why their investigations take so long. Their responsibility is to \nunderstand the system and make changes that would reduce the \nchance of the same sequence of events leading to a future accident.\nThe Swiss cheese metaphor suggests several ways to reduce \naccidents:\n•  Add more slices of cheese.\n•  Reduce the number of holes (or make the existing holes smaller).\n•  Alert the human operators when several holes have lined up.\nEach of these has operational implications. More slices of cheese \nmeans mores lines of defense, such as the requirement in aviation and \nother industries for checklists, where one person reads the items, \nanother does the operation, and the first person checks the opera-\ntion to confirm it was done appropriately.\nReducing the number of critical safety points where error can \noccur is like reducing the number or size of the holes in the Swiss \ncheese. Properly designed equipment will reduce the opportunity \nfor slips and mistakes, which is like reducing the number of holes \n",

This is precisely how the \nsafety level of commercial aviation has been dramatically improved. \nDeborah Hersman, chair of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, described the design philosophy as:\nU.S. airlines carry about two million people through the skies safely \nevery day, which has been achieved in large part through design redun-\ndancy and layers of defense.\nDesign redundancy and layers of defense: that’s Swiss cheese. \nThe metaphor illustrates the futility of trying to find the one un-\nderlying cause of an accident (usually some person) and punishing \nthe culprit. Instead, we need to think about systems, about all the \ninteracting factors that lead to human error and then to accidents, \nand devise ways to make the systems, as a whole, more reliable.\nWhen Good Design Isn’t Enough \nWHEN PEOPLE REALLY ARE AT FAULT\nI am sometimes asked whether it is really right to say that people \nare never at fault, that it is always bad design. That’s a sensible \nquestion. And yes, of course, sometimes it is the person who is \nat fault.\nEven competent people can lose competency if sleep deprived, fa-\ntigued, or under the influence of drugs. This is why we have laws \nbanning pilots from flying if they have been drinking within some \nspecified period and why we limit the number of hours they can \nfly without rest. Most professions that involve the risk of death or \ninjury have similar regulations about drinking, sleep, and drugs. \nBut everyday jobs do not have these restrictions. Hospitals often re-\nquire their staff to go without sleep for durations that far exceed the \nsafety requirements of airlines. Why? Would you be happy having a \nsleep-deprived physician operating on you? Why is sleep depriva-\ntion considered dangerous in one situation and ignored in another?\nSome activities have height, age, or strength requirements. \nOthers require considerable skills or technical knowledge: people \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n211\nnot trained or not competent should not be doing them. That is \nwhy many activities require government-approved training and li-\ncensing. Some examples are automobile driving, airplane piloting, \nand medical practice. All require instructional courses and tests. \nIn aviation, it isn’t sufficient to be trained: pilots must also keep \nin practice by flying some minimum number of hours per month.\nDrunk driving is still a major cause of automobile accidents: this \nis clearly the fault of the drinker. Lack of sleep is another major \nculprit in vehicle accidents. But because people occasionally are \nat fault does not justify the attitude that assumes they are always \nat fault. The far greater percentage of accidents is the result of poor \ndesign, either of equipment or, as is often the case in industrial \naccidents, of the procedures to be followed.\nAs noted in the discussion of deliberate violations earlier in this \nchapter (page 169), people will sometimes deliberately violate \nprocedures and rules, perhaps because they cannot get their jobs \ndone otherwise, perhaps because they believe there are extenu-\nating circumstances, and sometimes because they are taking the \ngamble that the relatively low probability of failure does not apply \nto them. Unfortunately, if someone does a dangerous activity that \nonly results in injury or death one time in a million, that can lead \nto hundreds of deaths annually across the world, with its 7 billion \npeople. One of my favorite examples in aviation is of a pilot who, \nafter experiencing low oil-pressure readings in all three of his en-\ngines, stated that it must be an instrument failure because it was a \none-in-a-million chance that the readings were true. He was right \nin his assessment, but unfortunately, he was the one. In the United \nStates alone there were roughly 9 million flights in 2012. So, a one-\nin-a-million chance could translate into nine incidents. \nSometimes, people really are at fault.\nResilience Engineering\nIn industrial applications, accidents in large, complex systems \nsuch as oil wells, oil refineries, chemical processing plants, electri-\ncal power systems, transportation, and medical services can have \nmajor impacts on the company and the surrounding community. \n\n\n212 The Design of Everyday Things\nSometimes the problems do not arise in the organization but out-\nside it, such as when fierce storms, earthquakes, or tidal waves \ndemolish large parts of the existing infrastructure. In either case, \nthe question is how to design and manage these systems so that \nthey can restore services with a minimum of disruption and dam-\nage. An important approach is resilience engineering, with the goal \nof designing systems, procedures, management, and the training \nof people so they are able to respond to problems as they arise. It \nstrives to ensure that the design of all these things—the equipment, \nprocedures, and communication both among workers and also ex-\nternally to management and the public—are continually being as-\nsessed, tested, and improved.\nThus, major computer providers can deliberately cause errors in \ntheir systems to test how well the company can respond. This is done \nby deliberately shutting down critical facilities to ensure that the \nbackup systems and redundancies actually work. Although it might \nseem dangerous to do this while the systems are online, serving real \ncustomers, the only way to test these large, complex systems is by do-\ning so. Small tests and simulations do not carry the complexity, stress \nlevels, and unexpected events that characterize real system failures.\nAs Erik Hollnagel, David Woods, and Nancy Leveson, the au-\nthors of an early influential series of books on the topic, have skill-\nfully summarized:\nResilience engineering is a paradigm for safety management that fo-\ncuses on how to help people cope with complexity under pressure to \nachieve success. It strongly contrasts with what is typical today—a \nparadigm of tabulating error as if it were a thing, followed by interven-\ntions to reduce this count. A resilient organisation treats safety as a core \nvalue, not a commodity that can be counted. Indeed, safety shows itself \nonly by the events that do not happen! Rather than view past success \nas a reason to ramp down investments, such organisations continue to \ninvest in anticipating the changing potential for failure because they \nappreciate that their knowledge of the gaps is imperfect and that their \nenvironment constantly changes. One measure of resilience is therefore \nthe ability to create foresight—to anticipate the changing shape of risk, \n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n213\nbefore failure and harm occurs. (Reprinted by permission of the publishers. \nHollnagel, Woods, & Leveson, 2006, p. 6.)\nThe Paradox of Automation\nMachines are getting smarter. More and more tasks are becoming \nfully automated. As this happens, there is a tendency to believe \nthat many of the difficulties involved with human control will go \naway. Across the world, automobile accidents kill and injure tens \nof millions of people every year. When we finally have widespread \nadoption of self-driving cars, the accident and casualty rate will \nprobably be dramatically reduced, just as automation in factories \nand aviation have increased efficiency while lowering both error \nand the rate of injury.\nWhen automation works, it is wonderful, but when it fails, the \nresulting impact is usually unexpected and, as a result, danger-\nous. Today, automation and networked electrical generation sys-\ntems have dramatically reduced the amount of time that electrical \npower is not available to homes and businesses. But when the elec-\ntrical power grid goes down, it can affect huge sections of a coun-\ntry and take many days to recover. With self-driving cars, I predict \nthat we will have fewer accidents and injuries, but that when there \nis an accident, it will be huge.\nAutomation keeps getting more and more capable. Automatic \nsystems can take over tasks that used to be done by people, \nwhether it is maintaining the proper temperature, automatically \nkeeping an automobile within its assigned lane at the correct \ndistance from the car in front, enabling airplanes to fly by them-\nselves from takeoff to landing, or allowing ships to navigate by \nthemselves. When the automation works, the tasks are usually \ndone as well as or better than by people. Moreover, it saves peo-\nple from the dull, dreary routine tasks, allowing more useful, \nproductive use of time, reducing fatigue and error. But when \nthe task gets too complex, automation tends to give up. This, of \ncourse, is precisely when it is needed the most. The paradox is \nthat automation can take over the dull, dreary tasks, but fail with \nthe complex ones.\n\n\n214 The Design of Everyday Things\nWhen automation fails, it often does so without warning. This is \na situation I have documented very thoroughly in my other books \nand many of my papers, as have many other people in the field of \nsafety and automation. When the failure occurs, the human is “out \nof the loop.” This means that the person has not been paying much \nattention to the operation, and it takes time for the failure to be \nnoticed and evaluated, and then to decide how to respond.\nIn an airplane, when the automation fails, there is usually con-\nsiderable time for the pilots to understand the situation and re-\nspond. Airplanes fly quite high: over 10 km (6 miles) above the \nearth, so even if the plane were to start falling, the pilots might \nhave several minutes to respond. Moreover, pilots are extremely \nwell trained. When automation fails in an automobile, the person \nmight have only a fraction of a second to avoid an accident. This \nwould be extremely difficult even for the most expert driver, and \nmost drivers are not well trained.\nIn other circumstances, such as ships, there may be more time \nto respond, but only if the failure of the automation is noticed. In \none dramatic case, the grounding of the cruise ship Royal Majesty in \n1997, the failure lasted for several days and was only detected in the \npostaccident investigation, after the ship had run aground, causing \nseveral million dollars in damage. What happened? The ship’s lo-\ncation was normally determined by the Global Positioning System \n(GPS), but the cable that connected the satellite antenna to the nav-\nigation system somehow had become disconnected (nobody ever \ndiscovered how). As a result, the navigation system had switched \nfrom using GPS signals to “dead reckoning,” approximating the \nship’s location by estimating speed and direction of travel, but the \ndesign of the navigation system didn’t make this apparent. As a re-\nsult, as the ship traveled from Bermuda to its destination of Boston, \nit went too far south and went aground on Cape Cod, a peninsula \njutting out of the water south of Boston. The automation had per-\nformed flawlessly for years, which increased people’s trust and re-\nliance upon it, so the normal manual checking of location or careful \nperusal of the display (to see the tiny letters “dr” indicating “dead \nreckoning” mode) were not done. This was a huge mode error failure.\n\n\n \nfive: Human Error? No, Bad Design \n215\nDesign Principles for Dealing with Error\nPeople are flexible, versatile, and creative. Machines are rigid, pre-\ncise, and relatively fixed in their operations. There is a mismatch \nbetween the two, one that can lead to enhanced capability if used \nproperly. Think of an electronic calculator. It doesn’t do mathemat-\nics like a person, but can solve problems people can’t. Moreover, \ncalculators do not make errors. So the human plus calculator is a \nperfect collaboration: we humans figure out what the important \nproblems are and how to state them. Then we use calculators to \ncompute the solutions. \nDifficulties arise when we do not think of people and machines \nas collaborative systems, but assign whatever tasks can be auto-\nmated to the machines and leave the rest to people. This ends up \nrequiring people to behave in machine like fashion, in ways that \ndiffer from human capabilities. We expect people to monitor ma-\nchines, which means keeping alert for long periods, something we \nare bad at. We require people to do repeated operations with the \nextreme precision and accuracy required by machines, again some-\nthing we are not good at. When we divide up the machine and \nhuman components of a task in this way, we fail to take advantage \nof human strengths and capabilities but instead rely upon areas \nwhere we are genetically, biologically unsuited. Yet, when people \nfail, they are blamed.\nWhat we call “human error” is often simply a human action that \nis inappropriate for the needs of technology. As a result, it flags a \ndeficit in our technology. It should not be thought of as error. We \nshould eliminate the concept of error: instead, we should realize \nthat people can use assistance in translating their goals and plans \ninto the appropriate form for technology.\nGiven the mismatch between human competencies and tech-\nnological requirements, errors are inevitable. Therefore, the best \ndesigns take that fact as given and seek to minimize the opportu-\nnities for errors while also mitigating the consequences. Assume \nthat every possible mishap will happen, so protect against them. \nMake actions reversible; make errors less costly. Here are key de-\nsign principles:\n\n\n216 The Design of Everyday Things\n•  Put the knowledge required to operate the technology in the world. \nDon’t require that all the knowledge must be in the head. Allow for \nefficient operation when people have learned all the requirements, \nwhen they are experts who can perform without the knowledge in \nthe world, but make it possible for non-experts to use the knowledge \nin the world. This will also help experts who need to perform a rare, \ninfrequently performed operation or return to the technology after a \nprolonged absence.\n•  Use the power of natural and artificial constraints: physical, logical, \nsemantic, and cultural. Exploit the power of forcing functions and \nnatural mappings.\n•  Bridge the two gulfs, the Gulf of Execution and the Gulf of Evalua-\ntion. Make things visible, both for execution and evaluation. On the \nexecution side, provide feedforward information: make the options \nreadily available. On the evaluation side, provide feedback: make the \nresults of each action apparent. Make it possible to determine the sys-\ntem’s status readily, easily, accurately, and in a form consistent with \nthe person’s goals, plans, and expectations. \nWe should deal with error by embracing it, by seeking to under-\nstand the causes and ensuring they do not happen again. We need \nto assist rather than punish or scold.\n\n\nC H A P T E R  N U M B E R\n \n 217\nC H A P T E R  S I X\nDESIGN\nTHINKING\nOne of my rules in consulting is simple: never solve the \nproblem I am asked to solve. Why such a counterintu-\nitive rule? Because, invariably, the problem I am asked \nto solve is not the real, fundamental, root problem. It \nis usually a symptom. Just as in Chapter 5, where the solution to \naccidents and errors was to determine the real, underlying cause \nof the events, in design, the secret to success is to understand what \nthe real problem is.\nIt is amazing how often people solve the problem before them \nwithout bothering to question it. In my classes of graduate students \nin both engineering and business, I like to give them a problem to \nsolve on the first day of class and then listen the next week to their \nwonderful solutions. They have masterful analyses, drawings, and \nillustrations. The MBA students show spreadsheets in which they \nhave analyzed the demographics of the potential customer base. \nThey show lots of numbers: costs, sales, margins, and profits. The \nengineers show detailed drawings and specifications. It is all well \ndone, brilliantly presented.\nWhen all the presentations are over, I congratulate them, but \nask: “How do you know you solved the correct problem?” They \nare puzzled.

The real \nworld is not like the university. In the university, professors make \nup artificial problems. In the real world, the problems do not come \nin nice, neat packages. They have to be discovered. It is all too easy \nto see only the surface problems and never dig deeper to address \nthe real issues.\nSolving the Correct Problem\nEngineers and businesspeople are trained to solve problems. De-\nsigners are trained to discover the real problems. A brilliant solu-\ntion to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all: \nsolve the correct problem.\nGood designers never start by trying to solve the problem given \nto them: they start by trying to understand what the real issues are. \nAs a result, rather than converge upon a solution, they diverge, \nstudying people and what they are trying to accomplish, generat-\ning idea after idea after idea. It drives managers crazy. Managers \nwant to see progress: designers seem to be going backward when \nthey  are given a precise problem and instead of getting to work,  they \nignore it and generate new issues to consider, new directions to \nexplore. And not just one, but many. What is going on?\nThe key emphasis of this book is the importance of developing \nproducts that fit the needs and capabilities of people. Design can \nbe driven by many different concerns. Sometimes it is driven by \ntechnology, sometimes by competitive pressures or by aesthetics. \nSome designs explore the limits of technological possibilities; some \nexplore the range of imagination, of society, of art or fashion. Engi-\nneering design tends to emphasize reliability, cost, and efficiency. \nThe focus of this book, and of the discipline called human-centered \ndesign, is to ensure that the result fits human desires, needs, and \ncapabilities. After all, why do we make products? We make them \nfor people to use.\nDesigners have developed a number of techniques to avoid being \ncaptured by too facile a solution. They take the original problem \n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking \n219\nas a suggestion, not as a final statement, then think broadly about \nwhat the issues underlying this problem statement might really be \n(as was done through the “Five Whys” approach to getting at the \nroot cause, described in Chapter 5). Most important of all is that \nthe process be iterative and expansive. Designers resist the temp-\ntation to jump immediately to a solution for the stated problem. \nInstead, they first spend time determining what basic, fundamen-\ntal (root) issue needs to be addressed. They don’t try to search for \na solution until they have determined the real problem, and even \nthen, instead of solving that problem, they stop to consider a wide \nrange of potential solutions. Only then will they finally converge \nupon their proposal. This process is called design thinking.\nDesign thinking is not an exclusive property of designers—all \ngreat innovators have practiced this, even if unknowingly, re-\ngardless of whether they were artists or poets, writers or scien-\ntists, engineers or businesspeople. But because designers pride \nthemselves on their ability to innovate, to find creative solutions to \nfundamental problems, design thinking has become the hallmark \nof the modern design firm. Two of the powerful tools of design \n thinking are human-centered design and the double-diamond \ndiverge-converge model of design.\nHuman-centered design (HCD) is the process of ensuring that \npeople’s needs are met, that the resulting product is understand-\nable and usable, that it accomplishes the desired tasks, and that the \nexperience of use is positive and enjoyable. Effective design needs \nto satisfy a large number of constraints and concerns, including \nshape and form, cost and efficiency, reliability and effectiveness, \nunderstandability and usability, the pleasure of the appearance, \nthe pride of ownership, and the joy of actual use. HCD is a proce-\ndure for addressing these requirements, but with an emphasis on \ntwo things: solving the right problem, and doing so in a way that \nmeets human needs and capabilities.\nOver time, the many different people and industries that have \nbeen involved in design have settled upon a common set of meth-\nods for doing HCD. Everyone has his or her own favorite method, \n\n\n220 The Design of Everyday Things\nbut all are variants on the common theme: iterate through the four \nstages of observation, generation, prototyping, and testing. But \neven before this, there is one overriding principle: solve the right \nproblem.\nThese two components of design—finding the right problem and \nmeeting human needs and capabilities—give rise to two phases of \nthe design process. The first phase is to find the right problem, the \nsecond is to find the right solution. Both phases use the HCD pro-\ncess. This double-phase approach to design led the British Design \nCouncil to describe it as a “double diamond.” So that is where we \nstart the story.\nThe Double-Diamond Model of Design\nDesigners often start by questioning the problem given to them: \nthey expand the scope of the problem, diverging to examine all \nthe fundamental issues that underlie it. Then they converge upon \na single problem statement. During the solution phase of their \nstudies, they first expand the space of possible solutions, the di-\nvergence phase. Finally, they converge upon a proposed solution \n(Figure 6.1). This double diverge-converge pattern was first intro-\nduced in 2005 by the British Design Council, which called it the double-\ndiamond design process model. The Design Council divided the \ndesign process into four stages: “discover” and “define”—for \nthe divergence and convergence phases of finding the right problem, \nTIME\nALTERNATIVES\nFINDING THE RIGHT\nSOLUTION\nFINDING THE RIGHT\nPROBLEM\nConvergence\nDivergence\nConvergence\nDivergence\nF IGU RE 6 .1. \nThe Double-\nDiamond Model of Design. \nStart with an idea, and through \nthe initial design research, ex-\npand the thinking to explore the \nfundamental issues. Only then is \nit time to converge upon the real, \nunderlying problem. Similarly, \nuse design research tools to ex-\nplore a wide variety of solutions \nbefore converging upon one. \n(Slightly modified from the work of \nthe British Design Council, 2005.)\n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 221\nand “develop” and “deliver”—for the divergence and convergence \nphases of finding the right solution. \nThe double diverge-converge process is quite effective at free-\ning designers from unnecessary restrictions to the problem and \nsolution spaces. But you can sympathize with a product manager \nwho, having given the designers a problem to solve, finds them \nquestioning the assignment and insisting on traveling all over \nthe world to seek deeper understanding. Even when the design-\ners start focusing upon the problem, they do not seem to make \nprogress, but instead develop a wide variety of ideas and thoughts, \nmany only half-formed, many clearly impractical. All this can be \nrather unsettling to the product manager who, concerned about \nmeeting the schedule, wants to see immediate convergence. To add \nto the frustration of the product manager, as the designers start to \nconverge upon a solution, they may realize that they have inap-\npropriately formulated the problem, so the entire process must be \nrepeated (although it can go more quickly this time).\nThis repeated divergence and convergence is important in prop-\nerly determining the right problem to be solved and then the best \nway to solve it. It looks chaotic and ill-structured, but it actually \nfollows well-established principles and procedures. How does \nthe product manager keep the entire team on schedule despite the \napparent random and divergent methods of designers? Encourage \ntheir free exploration, but hold them to the schedule (and budget) \nconstraints. There is nothing like a firm deadline to get creative \nminds to reach convergence.\nThe Human-Centered Design Process\nThe double-diamond describes the two phases of design: finding \nthe right problem and fulfilling human needs. But how are these \nactually done? This is where the human-centered design pro-\ncess comes into play: it takes place within the double-diamond \ndiverge-converge process.\nThere are four different activities in the human-centered design \nprocess (Figure 6.2):\n\n\n222 The Design of Everyday Things\n1. Observation\n2. Idea generation (ideation)\n3. Prototyping\n4. Testing\nThese four activities are iterated; \nthat is, they are repeated over and \nover, with each cycle yielding more \ninsights and getting closer to the de-\nsired solution. Now let us examine \neach activity separately.\nOBSERVATION\nThe initial research to understand \nthe nature of the problem itself is \npart of the discipline of design re-\nsearch. Note that this is research \nabout the customer and the people \nwho will use the products under consideration. It is not the kind \nof research that scientists do in their laboratories, trying to find \nnew laws of nature. The design researcher will go to the potential \ncustomers, observing their activities, attempting to understand \ntheir interests, motives, and true needs. The problem definition \nfor the product design will come from this deep understanding of \nthe goals the people are trying to accomplish and the impediments \nthey experience. One of its most critical techniques is to observe the \nwould-be customers in their natural environment, in their normal \nlives, wherever the product or service being designed will actually \nbe used. Watch them in their homes, schools, and offices. Watch \nthem commute, at parties, at mealtime, and with friends at the local \nbar. Follow them into the shower if necessary, because it is essential \nto understand the real situations that they encounter, not some pure \nisolated experience. This technique is called applied ethnography, a \nmethod adapted from the field of anthropology. Applied ethnog-\nraphy differs from the slower, more methodical, research-oriented \npractice of academic anthropologists because the goals are different. \nFIGURE 6.2. The Iterative Cycle \nof Human-Centered Design. Make \nobservations on the intended tar-\nget population, generate ideas, \nproduce prototypes and test them. \nRepeat until satisfied. This is often \ncalled the spiral method (rather than \nthe circle depicted here), to empha-\nsize that each iteration through the \nstages makes progress.\n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 223\nFor one, design researchers have the goal of determining human \nneeds that can be addressed through new products. For another, \nproduct cycles are driven by schedule and budget, both of which \nrequire more rapid assessment than is typical in academic studies \nthat might go on for years.\nIt’s important that the people being observed match those of the \nintended audience. Note that traditional measures of people, such \nas age, education, and income, are not always important: what \nmatters most are the activities to be performed. Even when we \nlook at widely different cultures, the activities are often surpris-\ningly similar. As a result, the studies can focus upon the activi-\nties and how they get done, while being sensitive to how the local \nenvironment and culture might modify those activities. In some \ncases, such as the products widely used in business, the activity \ndominates. Thus, automobiles, computers, and phones are pretty \nstandardized across the world because their designs reflect the ac-\ntivities being supported.\nIn some cases, detailed analyses of the intended group are nec-\nessary. Japanese teenage girls are quite different from Japanese \nwomen, and in turn, very different from German teenage girls. If \na product is intended for subcultures like these, the exact popu-\nlation must be studied. Another way of putting it is that different \nproducts serve different needs. Some products are also symbols of \nstatus or group membership. Here, although they perform useful \nfunctions, they are also fashion statements. This is where teenagers \nin one culture differ from those of another, and even from younger \nchildren and older adults of the same culture. Design researchers \nmust carefully adjust the focus of their observations to the intended \nmarket and people for whom the product is intended.\nWill the product be used in some country other than where it is \nbeing designed? There is only one way to find out: go there (and \nalways include natives in the team). Don’t take a shortcut and \nstay home, talking to students or visitors from that country while \nremaining in your own: what you will learn is seldom an accu-\nrate reflection of the target population or of the ways in which the \nproposed product will actually be used. There is no substitute for \n\n\n224 The Design of Everyday Things\ndirect observation of and interaction with the people who will be \nusing the product.\nDesign research supports both diamonds of the design process. \nThe first diamond, finding the right problem, requires a deep un-\nderstanding of the true needs of people. Once the problem has \nbeen defined, finding an appropriate solution again requires deep \nunderstanding of the intended population, how those people per-\nform their activities, their capabilities and prior experience, and \nwhat cultural issues might be impacted.\nDESIGN RESE A RC H V ERSUS M A R KE T RESE A RC H\nDesign and marketing are two important parts of the product \ndevelopment group. The two fields are complementary, but \neach has a different focus. Design wants to know what people re-\nally need and how they actually will use the product or service \nunder consideration. Marketing wants to know what people will \nbuy, which includes learning how they make their purchasing de-\ncisions. These different aims lead the two groups to develop dif-\nferent methods of inquiry. Designers tend to use qualitative ob-\nservational methods by which they can study people in depth, \nunderstanding how they do their activities and the environmental \nfactors that come into play. These methods are very time consum-\ning, so designers typically only examine small numbers of people, \noften numbering in the tens.\nMarketing is concerned with customers. Who might possibly \npurchase the item? What factors might entice them to consider \nand purchase a product? Marketing traditionally uses large-scale, \nquantitative studies, with heavy reliance on focus groups, surveys, \nand questionnaires. In marketing, it is not uncommon to converse \nwith hundreds of people in focus groups, and to question tens of \nthousands of people by means of questionnaires and surveys.\nThe advent of the Internet and the ability to assess huge \namounts of data have given rise to new methods of formal, quan-\ntitative market analysis. “Big data,” it is called, or sometimes \n“market analytics.” For popular websites, A/B testing is possible \nin which two potential variants of an offering are tested by giving \n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 225\nsome randomly selected fraction of visitors (perhaps 10 percent) \none set of web pages (the A set); and another randomly selected \nset of visitors, the other alternative (the B set). In a few hours, hun-\ndreds of thousands of visitors may have been exposed to each test \nset, making it easy to see which yields better results. Moreover, \nthe website can capture a wealth of information about people and \ntheir behavior: age, income, home and work addresses, previous \npurchases, and other websites visited. The virtues of the use of big \ndata for market research are frequently touted. The deficiencies \nare seldom noted, except for concerns about invasions of personal \nprivacy. In addition to privacy issues, the real problem is that nu-\nmerical correlations say nothing of people’s real needs, of their \ndesires, and of the reasons for their activities. As a result, these \nnumerical data can give a false impression of people. But the use of \nbig data and market analytics is seductive: no travel, little expense, \nand huge numbers, sexy charts, and impressive statistics, all very \npersuasive to the executive team trying to decide which new prod-\nucts to develop. After all, what would you trust—neatly presented, \ncolorful charts, statistics, and significance levels based on millions \nof observations, or the subjective impressions of a motley crew of \ndesign researchers who worked, slept, and ate in remote villages, \nwith minimal sanitary facilities and poor infrastructure? \nThe different methods have different goals and produce very \ndifferent results. Designers complain that the methods used by \nmarketing don’t get at real behavior: what people say they do and \nwant does not correspond with their actual behavior or desires. \nPeople in marketing complain that although design research meth-\nods yield deep insights, the small number of people observed is a \nconcern. Designers counter with the observation that traditional \nmarketing methods provide shallow insight into a large number \nof people.\nThe debate is not useful. All groups are necessary. Customer \nresearch is a tradeoff: deep insights on real needs from a tiny set \nof people, versus broad, reliable purchasing data from a wide \nrange and large number of people. We need both. Designers un-\nderstand what people really need. Marketing understands what \n",

These are not the same things, which is why \nboth approaches are required: marketing and design researchers \nshould work together in complementary teams.\nWhat are the requirements for a successful product? First, if no-\nbody buys the product, then all else is irrelevant. The product de-\nsign has to provide support for all the factors people use in making \npurchase decisions. Second, once the product has been purchased \nand is put into use, it must support real needs so that people can \nuse, understand, and take pleasure from it. The design specifications \nmust include both factors: marketing and design, buying and using.\nIDEA GENERATION\nOnce the design requirements are determined, the next step for \na design team is to generate potential solutions. This process is \ncalled idea generation, or ideation. This exercise might be done for \nboth of the double diamonds: during the phase of finding the cor-\nrect problem, then during the problem solution phase.\nThis is the fun part of design: it is where creativity is critical. \nThere are many ways of generating ideas: many of these methods \nfall under the heading of “brainstorming.” Whatever the method \nused, two major rules are usually followed:\n•  Generate numerous ideas. It is dangerous to become fixated upon \none or two ideas too early in the process.\n•  Be creative without regard for constraints. Avoid criticizing ideas, \nwhether your own or those of others. Even crazy ideas, often obvi-\nously wrong, can contain creative insights that can later be extracted \nand put to good use in the final idea selection. Avoid premature dis-\nmissal of ideas.\nI like to add a third rule:\n• Question everything. I am particularly fond of “stupid” questions. \nA stupid question asks about things so fundamental that everyone \nassumes the answer is obvious. But when the question is taken seri-\nously, it often turns out to be profound: the obvious often is not ob-\n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 227\nvious at all. What we assume to be obvious is simply the way things \nhave always been done, but now that it is questioned, we don’t actu-\nally know the reasons. Quite often the solution to problems is discov-\nered through stupid questions, through questioning the obvious.\nPROTOTYPING\nThe only way to really know whether an idea is reasonable is to \ntest it. Build a quick prototype or mock-up of each potential solu-\ntion. In the early stages of this process, the mock-ups can be pen-\ncil sketches, foam and cardboard models, or simple images made \nwith simple drawing tools. I have made mock-ups with spread-\nsheets, PowerPoint slides, and with sketches on index cards or \nsticky notes. Sometimes ideas are best conveyed by skits, espe-\ncially if you’re developing services or automated systems that are \ndifficult to prototype.\nOne popular prototype technique is called “Wizard of Oz,” after \nthe wizard in L. Frank Baum’s classic book (and the classic movie) \nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The wizard was actually just an ordi-\nnary person but, through the use of smoke and mirrors, he man-\naged to appear mysterious and omnipotent. In other words, it was \nall a fake: the wizard had no special powers.\nThe Wizard of Oz method can be used to mimic a huge, powerful \nsystem long before it can be built. It can be remarkably effective in \nthe early stages of product development. I once used this method \nto test a system for making airline reservations that had been de-\nsigned by a research group at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto \nResearch Center (today it is simply the Palo Alto Research Center, \nor PARC). We brought people into my laboratory in San Diego one at \na time, seated them in a small, isolated room, and had them type \ntheir travel requirements into a computer. They thought they were \ninteracting with an automated travel assistance program, but in \nfact, one of my graduate students was sitting in an adjacent room, \nreading the typed queries and typing back responses (looking up \nreal travel schedules where appropriate). This simulation taught \nus a lot about the requirements for such a system. We learned, for \nexample, that people’s sentences were very different from the ones \n\n\n228 The Design of Everyday Things\nwe had designed the system to handle. Example: One of the people \nwe tested requested a round-trip ticket between San Diego and \nSan Francisco. After the system had determined the desired flight \nto San Francisco, it asked, “When would you like to return?” The \nperson responded, “I would like to leave on the following Tues-\nday, but I have to be back before my first class at 9 am.” We soon \nlearned that it wasn’t sufficient to understand the sentences: we \nalso had to do problem-solving, using considerable knowledge \nabout such things as airport and meeting locations, traffic patterns, \ndelays for getting baggage and rental cars, and of course, parking—\nmore than our system was capable of doing. Our initial goal was to \nunderstand language. The studies demonstrated that the goal was \ntoo limited: we needed to understand human activities.\nPrototyping during the problem specification phase is done mainly \nto ensure that the problem is well understood. If the target popu-\nlation is already using something related to the new product, that \ncan be considered a prototype. During the problem solution phase \nof design, then real prototypes of the proposed solution are invoked.\nTESTING\nGather a small group of people who correspond as closely as pos-\nsible to the target population—those for whom the product is in-\ntended. Have them use the prototypes as nearly as possible to the \nway they would actually use them. If the device is normally used \nby one person, test one person at a time. If it is normally used by a \ngroup, test a group. The only exception is that even if the normal \nusage is by a single person, it is useful to ask a pair of people to use \nit together, one person operating the prototype, the other guiding \nthe actions and interpreting the results (aloud). Using pairs in this \nway causes them to discuss their ideas, hypotheses, and frustra-\ntions openly and naturally. The research team should be observing, \neither by sitting behind those being tested (so as not to distract \nthem) or by watching through video in another room (but having \nthe video camera visible and after describing the procedure). Video \nrecordings of the tests are often quite valuable, both for later show-\nings to team members who could not be present and for review.\n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 229\nWhen the study is over, get more detailed information about \nthe people’s thought processes by retracing their steps, reminding \nthem of their actions, and questioning them. Sometimes it helps to \nshow them video recordings of their activities as reminders.\nHow many people should be studied? Opinions vary, but my as-\nsociate, Jakob Nielsen, has long championed the number five: five \npeople studied individually. Then, study the results, refine them, \nand do another iteration, testing five different people. Five is usu-\nally enough to give major findings. And if you really want to test \nmany more people, it is far more effective to do one test of five, \nuse the results to improve the system, and then keep iterating the \ntest-design cycle until you have tested the desired number of \npeople. This gives multiple iterations of improvement, rather \nthan just one.\nLike prototyping, testing is done in the problem specification \nphase to ensure that the problem is well understood, then done \nagain in the problem solution phase to ensure that the new design \nmeets the needs and abilities of those who will use it.\nITERATION\nThe role of iteration in human-centered design is to enable contin-\nual refinement and enhancement. The goal is rapid prototyping \nand testing, or in the words of David Kelly, Stanford professor and \ncofounder of the design firm IDEO, “Fail frequently, fail fast.”\nMany rational executives (and government officials) never quite \nunderstand this aspect of the design process. Why would you want \nto fail? They seem to think that all that is necessary is to determine \nthe requirements, then build to those requirements. Tests, they be-\nlieve, are only necessary to ensure that the requirements are met. It \nis this philosophy that leads to so many unusable systems. Delib-\nerate tests and modifications make things better. Failures are to be \nencouraged—actually, they shouldn’t be called failures: they should \nbe thought of as learning experiences. If everything works perfectly, \nlittle is learned. Learning occurs when there are difficulties.\nThe hardest part of design is getting the requirements right, \nwhich means ensuring that the right problem is being solved, as \n\n\n230 The Design of Everyday Things\nwell as that the solution is appropriate. Requirements made in the \nabstract are invariably wrong. Requirements produced by asking \npeople what they need are invariably wrong. Requirements are de-\nveloped by watching people in their natural environment.\nWhen people are asked what they need, they primarily think of \nthe everyday problems they face, seldom noticing larger failures, \nlarger needs. They don’t question the major methods they use. \nMoreover, even if they carefully explain how they do their tasks \nand then agree that you got it right when you present it back to \nthem, when you watch them, they will often deviate from their \nown description. “Why?” you ask. “Oh, I had to do this one dif-\nferently,” they might reply; “this was a special case.” It turns out \nthat most cases are “special.” Any system that does not allow for \nspecial cases will fail.\nGetting the requirements right involves repeated study and test-\ning: iteration. Observe and study: decide what the problem might \nbe, and use the results of tests to determine which parts of the de-\nsign work, which don’t. Then iterate through all four processes \nonce again. Collect more design research if necessary, create more \nideas, develop the prototypes, and test them.\nWith each cycle, the tests and observations can be more targeted \nand more efficient. With each cycle of the iteration, the ideas be-\ncome clearer, the specifications better defined, and the prototypes \ncloser approximations to the target, the actual product. After the \nfirst few iterations, it is time to start converging upon a solution. \nThe several different prototype ideas can be collapsed into one.\nWhen does the process end? That is up to the product manager, \nwho needs to deliver the highest-possible quality while meeting \nthe schedule. In product development, schedule and cost provide \nvery strong constraints, so it is up to the design team to meet these \nrequirements while getting to an acceptable, high-quality design. \nNo matter how much time the design team has been allocated, the \nfinal results only seem to appear in the last twenty-four hours be-\nfore the deadline. (It’s like writing: no matter how much time you \nare given, it’s finished only hours before the deadline.)\n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking \n231\nACTIVITY-CENTERED VERSUS HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN\nThe intense focus on individuals is one of the hallmarks of human-\ncentered design, ensuring that products do fit real needs, that they \nare usable and understandable. But what if the product is intended \nfor people all across the world? Many manufacturers make essen-\ntially the same product for everyone. Although automobiles are \nslightly modified for the requirements of a country, they are all \nbasically the same the world round. The same is true for cameras, \ncomputers, telephones, tablets, television sets, and refrigerators. \nYes, there are some regional differences, but remarkably little. Even \nproducts specifically designed for one culture—rice cookers, for \nexample—get adopted by other cultures elsewhere.\nHow can we pretend to accommodate all of these very different, \nvery disparate people? The answer is to focus on activities, not the \nindividual person. I call this activity-centered design. Let the activity \ndefine the product and its structure. Let the conceptual model of \nthe product be built around the conceptual model of the activity.\nWhy does this work? Because people’s activities across the \nworld tend to be similar. Moreover, although people are unwilling \nto learn systems that appear to have arbitrary, incomprehensible \nrequirements, they are quite willing to learn things that appear \nto be essential to the activity. Does this violate the principles of \nhuman-centered design? Not at all: consider it an enhancement of \nHCD. After all, the activities are done by and for people. Activity-\ncentered approaches are human-centered approaches, far better \nsuited for large, nonhomogeneous populations.\nTake another look at the automobile, basically identical all across \nthe world. It requires numerous actions, many of which make lit-\ntle sense outside of the activity and that add to the complexity of \ndriving and to the rather long period it takes to become an accom-\nplished, skilled driver. There is the need to master foot pedals, to \nsteer, use turn signals, control the lights, and watch the road, all \nwhile being aware of events on either side of and behind the vehi-\ncle, and perhaps while maintaining conversations with the other \npeople in the auto. In addition, instruments on the panel need to \n\n\n232 The Design of Everyday Things\nbe watched, especially the speed indicator, as well as the water \ntemperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The locations of the rear- \nand side-view mirrors require the eyes to be off the road ahead for \nconsiderable time.\nPeople learn to drive cars quite successfully despite the need \nto master so many subcomponent tasks. Given the design of the \ncar and the activity of driving, each task seems appropriate. Yes, \nwe can make things better. Automatic transmissions eliminate the \nneed for the third pedal, the clutch. Heads-up displays mean that \ncritical instrument panel and navigation information can be dis-\nplayed in the space in front of the driver, so no eye movements are \nrequired to monitor them (although it requires an attentional shift, \nwhich does take attention off the road). Someday we will replace \nthe three different mirrors with one video display that shows ob-\njects on all sides of the car in one image, simplifying yet another \naction. How do we make things better? By careful study of the \nactivities that go on during driving.\nSupport the activities while being sensitive to human capabilities, \nand people will accept the design and learn whatever is necessary.\nON T HE DIF F ERENC ES BE T W EEN TASKS A ND AC T I V I T IES\nOne comment: there is a difference between task and activity. I \nemphasize the need to design for activities: designing for tasks is \nusually too restrictive. An activity is a high-level structure, perhaps \n“go shopping.” A task is a lower-level component of an activity, \nsuch as “drive to the market,” “find a shopping basket,” “use a \nshopping list to guide the purchases,” and so forth.\nAn activity is a collected set of tasks, but all performed together \ntoward a common high-level goal. A task is an organized, cohesive \nset of operations directed toward a single, low-level goal. Products \nhave to provide support for both activities and the various tasks \nthat are involved. Well-designed devices will package together the \nvarious tasks that are required to support an activity, making them \nwork seamlessly with one another, making sure the work done for \none does not interfere with the requirements for another.\n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 233\nActivities are hierarchical, so a high-level activity (going to work) \nwill have under it numerous lower-level ones. In turn, low-level \nactivities spawn “tasks,” and tasks are eventually executed by ba-\nsic “operations.” The American psychologists Charles Carver and \nMichael Scheier suggest that goals have three fundamental levels \nthat control activities. Be-goals are at the highest, most abstract \nlevel and govern a person’s being: they determine why people act, \nare fundamental and long lasting, and determine one’s self-image. \nOf far more practical concern for everyday activity is the next level \ndown, the do-goal, which is more akin to the goal I discuss in the \nseven stages of activity. Do-goals determine the plans and actions \nto be performed for an activity. The lowest level of this hierar-\nchy is the motor-goal, which specifies just how the actions are per-\nformed: this is more at the level of tasks and operations rather than \nactivities. The German psychologist Marc Hassenzahl has shown \nhow this three-level analysis can be used to guide in the develop-\nment and analysis of a person’s experience (the user experience, \nusually abbreviated UX) in interacting with products. \nFocusing upon tasks is too limiting. Apple’s success with its \nmusic player, the iPod, was because Apple supported the entire \nactivity involved in listening to music: discovering it, purchasing \nit, getting it into the music player, developing playlists (that could \nbe shared), and listening to the music. Apple also allowed other \ncompanies to add to the capabilities of the system with external \nspeakers, microphones, all sorts of accessories. Apple made it pos-\nsible to send the music throughout the home, to be listened to on \nthose other companies’ sound systems. Apple’s success was due to \nits combination of two factors: brilliant design plus support for the \nentire activity of music enjoyment.\nDesign for individuals and the results may be wonderful for the \nparticular people they were designed for, but a mismatch for oth-\ners. Design for activities and the result will be usable by everyone. \nA major benefit is that if the design requirements are consistent \nwith their activities, people will tolerate complexity and the re-\nquirements to learn something new: as long as the complexity and \n\n\n234 The Design of Everyday Things\nthe new things to be learned feel appropriate to the task, they will \nfeel natural and be viewed as reasonable.\nITERATIVE DESIGN VERSUS LINEAR STAGES\nThe traditional design process is linear, sometimes called the water-\nfall method because progress goes in a single direction, and once de-\ncisions have been made, it is difficult or impossible to go back. This \nis in contrast to the iterative method of human-centered design, \nwhere the process is circular, with continual refinement, contin-\nual change, and encouragement of backtracking, rethinking early \ndecisions. Many software developers experiment with variations \non the theme, variously called by such names as Scrum and Agile.\nLinear, waterfall methods make logical sense. It makes sense that \ndesign research should precede design, design precede engineer-\ning development, engineering precede manufacturing, and so on. \nIteration makes sense in helping to clarify the problem statement \nand requirements; but when projects are large, involving consid-\nerable people, time, and budget, it would be horribly expensive to \nallow iteration to last too long. On the other hand, proponents of \niterative development have seen far too many project teams rush \nto develop requirements that later prove to be faulty, sometimes \nwasting huge amounts of money as a result. Numerous large \nprojects have failed at a cost of multiple billions of dollars.\nThe most traditional waterfall methods are called gated meth-\nods because they have a linear set of phases or stages, with a gate \nblocking transition from one stage to the next. The gate is a man-\nagement review during which progress is evaluated and the deci-\nsion to proceed to the next stage is made.\nWhich method is superior? As is invariably the case where fierce \ndebate is involved, both have virtues and both have deficits. In de-\nsign, one of the most difficult activities is to get the specifications \nright: in other words, to determine that the correct problem is be-\ning solved. Iterative methods are designed to defer the formation of \nrigid specifications, to start off by diverging across a large set of pos-\nsible requirements or problem statements before convergence, then \nagain diverging across a large number of potential solutions before \n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 235\nconverging. Early prototypes have to be tested through real interac-\ntion with the target population in order to refine the requirements.\nThe iterative method, however, is best suited for the early design \nphases of a product, not for the later stages. It also has difficulty \nscaling its procedures to handle large projects. It is extremely dif-\nficult to deploy successfully on projects that involve hundreds or \neven thousands of developers, take years to complete, and cost \nin the millions or billions of dollars. These large projects include \ncomplex consumer goods and large programming jobs, such as au-\ntomobiles; operating systems for computers, tablets, and phones; \nand word processors and spreadsheets.\nDecision gates give management much better control over the \nprocess than they have in the iterative methods. However, they are \ncumbersome. The management reviews at each of the gates can \ntake considerable time, both in preparation for them and then in \nthe decision time after the presentations. Weeks can be wasted be-\ncause of the difficulty of scheduling all the senior executives from \nthe different divisions of the company who wish to have a say. \nMany groups are experimenting with different ways of manag-\ning the product development process. The best methods combine \nthe benefits of both iteration and stage reviews. Iteration occurs \ninside the stages, between the gates. The goal is to have the best of \nboth worlds: iterative experimentation to refine the problem and \nthe solution, coupled with management reviews at the gates.\nThe trick is to delay precise specification of the product require-\nments until some iterative testing with rapidly deployed prototypes \nhas been done, while still keeping tight control over schedule, bud-\nget, and quality. It may appear impossible to prototype some large \nprojects (for example, large transportation systems), but even there a \nlot can be done. The prototypes might be scaled objects, constructed \nby model makers or 3-D printing methods. Even well-rendered \ndrawings and videos of cartoons or simple animation sketches can \nbe useful. Virtual reality computer aids allow people to envision \nthemselves using the final product, and in the case of a building, to \nenvision living or working within it. All of these methods can pro-\nvide rapid feedback before much time or money has been expended.\n",

Large projects are especially \ndifficult, not only because of the problem of managing so many \ndifferent people and groups, but also because the projects’ long \ntime horizon introduces new difficulties. In the many years it takes \nto go from project formulation to completion, the requirements and \ntechnologies will probably change, making some of the proposed \nwork irrelevant and obsolete; the people who will make use of the \nresults might very well change; and the people involved in execut-\ning the project definitely will change.\nSome people will leave the project, perhaps because of illness or \ninjury, retirement or promotion. Some will change companies and \nothers will move on to other jobs in the same company. Whatever \nthe reason, considerable time is lost finding replacements and then \nbringing them up to the full knowledge and skill level required. \nSometimes this is not even possible because critical knowledge \nabout project decisions and methods are in the form we call implicit \nknowledge; that is, within the heads of the workers. When workers \nleave, their implicit knowledge goes with them. The management \nof large projects is a difficult challenge.\nWhat I Just Told You? \nIt Doesn’t Really Work That Way\nThe preceding sections describe the human-centered design pro-\ncess for product development. But there is an old joke about the \ndifference between theory and practice:\nIn theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. \nIn practice, there is.\nThe HCD process describes the ideal. But the reality of life within \na business often forces people to behave quite differently from that \nideal. One disenchanted member of the design team for a con-\nsumer products company told me that although his company pro-\n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 237\nfesses to believe in user experience and to follow human-centered \ndesign, in practice there are only two drivers of new products:\n1. Adding features to match the competition\n2. Adding some feature driven by a new technology\n“Do we look for human needs?” he asked, rhetorically. “No,” he \nanswered himself.\nThis is typical: market-driven pressures plus an engineering-\ndriven company yield ever-increasing features, complexity, and \nconfusion. But even companies that do intend to search for human \nneeds are thwarted by the severe challenges of the product devel-\nopment process, in particular, the challenges of insufficient time and \ninsufficient money. In fact, having watched many products succumb \nto these challenges, I propose a “Law of Product Development”:\nDON NORMAN’S LAW OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nThe day a product development process starts, it is behind schedule and \nabove budget.\nProduct launches are always accompanied by schedules and bud-\ngets. Usually the schedule is driven by outside considerations, in-\ncluding holidays, special product announcement opportunities, \nand even factory schedules. One product I worked on was given \nthe unrealistic timeline of four weeks because the factory in Spain \nwould then go on vacation, and when the workers returned, it \nwould be too late to get the product out in time for the Christmas \nbuying season.\nMoreover, product development takes time even to get started. \nPeople are never sitting around with nothing to do, waiting to be \ncalled for the product. No, they must be recruited, vetted, and then \ntransitioned off their current jobs. This all takes time, time that is \nseldom scheduled.\nSo imagine a design team being told that it is about to work on \na new product. “Wonderful,” cries the team; “we’ll immediately \nsend out our design researchers to study target customers.” “How \n\n\n238 The Design of Everyday Things\nlong will that take?” asks the product manager. “Oh, we can do it \nquickly: a week or two to make the arrangements, and then two \nweeks in the field. Perhaps a week to distill the findings. Four or \nfive weeks.” “Sorry,” says the product manager, “we don’t have \ntime. For that matter, we don’t have the budget to send a team into \nthe field for two weeks.” “But it’s essential if we really want to \nunderstand the customer,” argues the design team. “You’re abso-\nlutely right,” says the product manager, “but we’re behind sched-\nule: we can’t afford either the time or the money. Next time. Next \ntime we will do it right.” Except there is never a next time, because \nwhen the next time comes around, the same arguments get re-\npeated: that product also starts behind schedule and over budget.\nProduct development involves an incredible mix of disciplines, \nfrom designers to engineers and programmers, manufacturing, \npackaging, sales, marketing, and service. And more. The product \nhas to appeal to the current customer base as well as to expand \nbeyond to new customers. Patents create a minefield for designers \nand engineers, for today it is almost impossible to design or build \nanything that doesn’t conflict with patents, which means redesign \nto work one’s way through the mines.\nEach of the separate disciplines has a different view of the prod-\nuct, each has different but specific requirements to be met. Often \nthe requirements posed by each discipline are contradictory or \nincompatible with those of the other disciplines. But all of them \nare correct when viewed from their respective perspective. In most \ncompanies, however, the disciplines work separately, design pass-\ning its results to engineering and programming, which modify \nthe requirements to fit their needs. They then pass their results to \nmanufacturing, which does further modification, then marketing \nrequests changes. It’s a mess.\nWhat is the solution?\nThe way to handle the time crunch that eliminates the ability to \ndo good up-front design research is to separate that process from \nthe product team: have design researchers always out in the field, \nalways studying potential products and customers. Then, when \nthe product team is launched, the designers can say, “We already \n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 239\nexamined this case, so here are our recommendations.” The same \nargument applies to market researchers.\nThe clash of disciplines can be resolved by multidisciplinary \nteams whose participants learn to understand and respect the \nrequirements of one another. Good product development teams \nwork as harmonious groups, with representatives from all the \nrelevant disciplines present at all times. If all the viewpoints and \nrequirements can be understood by all participants, it is often pos-\nsible to think of creative solutions that satisfy most of the issues. \nNote that working with these teams is also a challenge. Everyone \nspeaks a different technical language. Each discipline thinks it is \nthe most important part of the process. Quite often, each discipline \nthinks the others are stupid, that they are making inane requests. \nIt takes a skilled product manager to create mutual understanding \nand respect. But it can be done.\nThe design practices described by the double-diamond and the \nhuman-centered design process are the ideal. Even though the ideal \ncan seldom be met in practice, it is always good to aim for the ideal, \nbut to be realistic about the time and budgetary challenges. These \ncan be overcome, but only if they are recognized and designed into \nthe process. Multidisciplinary teams allow for enhanced communi-\ncation and collaboration, often saving both time and money.\nThe Design Challenge\nIt is difficult to do good design. That is why it is such a rich, en-\ngaging profession with results that can be powerful and effective. \nDesigners are asked to figure out how to manage complex things, \nto manage the interaction of technology and people. Good design-\ners are quick learners, for today they might be asked to design a \ncamera; tomorrow, to design a transportation system or a compa-\nny’s organizational structure. How can one person work across so \nmany different domains? Because the fundamental principles of \ndesigning for people are the same across all domains. People are \nthe same, and so the design principles are the same.\nDesigners are only one part of the complex chain of processes \nand different professions involved in producing a product. Although \n\n\n240 The Design of Everyday Things\nthe theme of this book is the importance of satisfying the needs \nof the people who will ultimately use the product, other aspects of \nthe product are important; for example, its engineering effective-\nness, which includes its capabilities, reliability, and serviceability; \nits cost; and its financial viability, which usually means profitabil-\nity. Will people buy it? Each of these aspects poses its own set of \nrequirements, sometimes ones that appear to be in opposition to \nthose of the other aspects. Schedule and budget are often the two \nmost severe constraints.\nDesigners try hard to determine people’s real needs and to ful-\nfill them, whereas marketing is concerned with determining what \npeople will actually buy. What people need and what they buy are \ntwo different things, but both are important. It doesn’t matter how \ngreat the product is if nobody buys it. Similarly, if a company’s \nproducts are not profitable, the company might very well go out \nof business. In dysfunctional companies, each division of the com-\npany is skeptical of the value added to the product by the other \ndivisions.\nIn a properly run organization, team members coming from all \nthe various aspects of the product cycle get together to share their \nrequirements and to work harmoniously to design and produce \na product that satisfies them, or at least that does so with accept-\nable compromises. In dysfunctional companies, each team works \nin isolation, often arguing with the other teams, often watching its \ndesigns or specifications get changed by others in what each team \nconsiders an unreasonable way. Producing a good product requires \na lot more than good technical skills: it requires a harmonious, \nsmoothly functioning, cooperative and respectful organization.\nThe design process must address numerous constraints. In the \nsections that follow, I examine these other factors.\nPRODUCTS HAVE MULTIPLE, CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS\nDesigners must please their clients, who are not always the end \nusers. Consider major household appliances, such as stoves, refrig-\nerators, dishwashers, and clothes washers and dryers; and even \nfaucets and thermostats for heating and air-conditioning systems. \n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking \n241\nThey are often purchased by housing developers or landlords. \nIn businesses, purchasing departments make decisions for large \ncompanies; and owners or managers, for small companies. In all \nthese cases, the purchaser is probably interested primarily in price, \nperhaps in size or appearance, almost certainly not in usability. \nAnd once devices are purchased and installed, the purchaser has \nno further interest in them. The manufacturer has to attend to the \nrequirements of these decision makers, because these are the peo-\nple who actually buy the product. Yes, the needs of the eventual \nusers are important, but to the business, they seem of secondary \nimportance.\nIn some situations, cost dominates. Suppose, for example, you \nare part of a design team for office copiers. In large companies, \ncopying machines are purchased by the Printing and Duplicating \nCenter, then dispersed to the various departments. The copiers are \npurchased after a formal “request for proposals” has gone out to \nmanufacturers and dealers of machines. The selection is almost \nalways based on price plus a list of required features. Usability? \nNot considered. Training costs? Not considered. Maintenance? Not \nconsidered. There are no requirements regarding understandabil-\nity or usability of the product, even though in the end those aspects \nof the product can end up costing the company a lot of money \nin wasted time, increased need for service calls and training, and \neven lowered staff morale and lower productivity.\nThe focus on sales price is one reason we get unusable copying \nmachines and telephone systems in our places of employment. If \npeople complained strongly enough, usability could become a re-\nquirement in the purchasing specifications, and that requirement \ncould trickle back to the designers. But without this feedback, de-\nsigners must often design the cheapest possible products because \nthose are what sell. Designers need to understand their customers, \nand in many cases, the customer is the person who purchases the \nproduct, not the person who actually uses it. It is just as important to \nstudy those who do the purchasing as it is to study those who use it.\nTo make matters even more difficult, yet another set of people \nneeds to be considered: the engineers, developers, manufacturing, \n\n\n242 The Design of Everyday Things\nservices, sales, and marketing people who have to translate the \nideas from the design team into reality, and then sell and support \nthe product after it is shipped. These groups are users, too, not of \nthe product itself, but of the output of the design team. Designers \nare used to accommodating the needs of the product users, but \nthey seldom consider the needs of the other groups involved in \nthe product process. But if their needs are not considered, then \nas the product development moves through the process from de-\nsign to engineering, to marketing, to manufacturing, and so on, \neach new group will discover that it doesn’t meet their needs, so \nthey will change it. But piecemeal, after-the-fact changes invariably \nweaken the cohesion of the product. If all these requirements were \nknown at the start of the design process, a much more satisfactory \nresolution could have been devised.\nUsually the different company divisions have intelligent peo-\nple trying to do what is best for the company. When they make \nchanges to a design, it is because their requirements were not suit-\nably served. Their concerns and needs are legitimate, but changes \nintroduced in this way are almost always detrimental. The best \nway to counteract this is to ensure that representatives from all \nthe divisions are present during the entire design process, starting \nwith the decision to launch the product, continuing all the way \nthrough shipment to customers, service requirements, and repairs \nand returns. This way, all the concerns can be heard as soon as \nthey are discovered. There must be a multidisciplinary team over-\nseeing the entire design, engineering, and manufacturing process \nthat shares all departmental issues and concerns from day one, so \nthat everyone can design to satisfy them, and when conflicts arise, \nthe group together can determine the most satisfactory solution. \nSadly, it is the rare company that is organized this way.\nDesign is a complex activity. But the only way this complex pro-\ncess comes together is if all the relevant parties work together as \na team. It isn’t design against engineering, against marketing, \nagainst manufacturing: it is design together with all these other \nplayers. Design must take into account sales and marketing, ser-\nvicing and help desks, engineering and manufacturing, costs and \n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 243\nschedules. That’s why it’s so challenging. That’s why it’s so much \nfun and rewarding when it all comes together to create a success-\nful product.\nDESIGNING FOR SPECIAL PEOPLE\nThere is no such thing as the average person. This poses a particular \nproblem for the designer, who usually must come up with a single \ndesign for everyone. The designer can consult handbooks with ta-\nbles that show average arm reach and seated height, how far the \naverage person can stretch backward while seated, and how much \nroom is needed for average hips, knees, and elbows. Physical anthro-\npometry is what the field is called. With data, the designer can try \nto meet the size requirements for almost everyone, say for the 90th, \n95th, or even the 99th percentile. Suppose the product is designed \nto accommodate the 95th percentile, that is, for everyone except the \n5 percent of people who are smaller or larger. That leaves out a lot \nof people. The United States has approximately 300 million people, \nso 5 percent is 15 million. Even if the design aims at the 99th per-\ncentile it would still leave out 3 million people. And this is just for \nthe United States: the world has 7 billion people. Design for the 99th \npercentile of the world and 70 million people are left out.\nSome problems are not solved by adjustments or averages: Average \na left-hander with a right-hander and what do you get? Sometimes it \nis simply impossible to build one product that accommodates ev-\neryone, so the answer is to build different versions of the product. \nAfter all, we would not be happy with a store that sells only one \nsize and type of clothing: we expect clothing that fits our bodies, \nand people come in a very wide range of sizes. We don’t expect \nthe large variety of goods found in a clothing store to apply to \nall people or activities; we expect a wide variety of cooking appli-\nances, automobiles, and tools so we can select the ones that pre-\ncisely match our requirements. One device simply cannot work for \neveryone. Even such simple tools as pencils need to be designed \ndifferently for different activities and types of people.\nConsider the special problems of the aged and infirm, the hand-\nicapped, the blind or near blind, the deaf or hard of hearing, the \n",

Don’t be trapped by overly \ngeneral, inaccurate stereotypes. I return to these groups in the \nnext section.\nTHE STIGMA PROBLEM\n“I don’t want to go into a care facility. I’d have to be around all those old \npeople.” (Comment by a 95-year-old man.)\nMany devices designed to aid people with particular difficul-\nties fail. They may be well designed, they may solve the problem, \nbut they are rejected by their intended users. Why? Most peo-\nple do not wish to advertise their infirmities. Actually, many people \ndo not wish to admit having infirmities, even to themselves.\nWhen Sam Farber wanted to develop a set of household tools \nthat his arthritic wife could use, he worked hard to find a solution \nthat was good for everyone. The result was a series of tools that \nrevolutionized this field. For example, vegetable peelers used to be \nan inexpensive, simple metal tool, often of the form shown on the \nleft in Figure 6.3. These were awkward to use, painful to hold, and \nnot even that effective at \npeeling, but everyone as-\nsumed that this was how \nthey had to be.\nAfter considerable re-\nsearch, Farber settled \nupon the peeler shown on \nthe right in Figure 6.3 and \nbuilt a company, OXO, to \nmanufacture and distrib-\nute it. Even though the \npeeler was designed for \nsomeone with arthritis, it \nwas advertised as a bet-\nter peeler for everyone. It \nwas. Even though the de-\nFIGURE 6.3. Three Vegetable Peelers. The \ntraditional metal vegetable peeler is shown on \nthe left: inexpensive, but uncomfortable. The \nOXO peeler that revolutionized the industry \nis shown on the right. The result of this rev-\nolution is shown in the middle, a peeler from \nthe Swiss company Kuhn Rikon: colorful and \ncomfortable.\n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 245\nsign was more expensive than the regular peeler, it was so success-\nful that today, many companies make variations on this theme. You \nmay have trouble seeing the OXO peeler as revolutionary because \ntoday, many have followed in these footsteps. Design has become \na major theme for even simple tools such as peelers, as demon-\nstrated by the center peeler of Figure 6.3.\nConsider the two things special about the OXO peeler: cost and \ndesign for someone with an infirmity. Cost? The original peeler \nwas very inexpensive, so a peeler that is many times the cost of \nthe inexpensive one is still inexpensive. What about the special \ndesign for people with arthritis? The virtues for them were never \nmentioned, so how did they find it? OXO did the right thing and \nlet the world know that this was a better product. And the world \ntook note and made it successful. As for people who needed the \nbetter handle? It didn’t take long for the word to spread. Today, \nmany companies have followed the OXO route, producing peelers \nthat work extremely well, are comfortable, and are colorful. See \nFigure 6.3.\nWould you use a walker, wheelchair, crutches, or a cane? Many \npeople avoid these, even though they need them, because of the \nnegative image they cast: the stigma. Why? Years ago, a cane was \nfashionable: people who didn’t need them would use them any-\nway, twirling them, pointing with them, hiding brandy or whisky, \nknives or guns inside their handles. Just look at any movie depict-\ning nineteenth-century London. Why can’t devices for those who \nneed them be as sophisticated and fashionable today?\nOf all the devices intended to aid the elderly, perhaps the most \nshunned is the walker. Most of these devices are ugly. They cry out, \n“Disability here.” Why not transform them into products to be proud \nof? Fashion statements, perhaps. This thinking has already begun \nwith some medical appliances. Some companies are making hearing \naids and glasses for children and adolescents with special colors and \nstyles that appeal to these age groups. Fashion accessories. Why not?\nThose of you who are young, do not smirk. Physical disabilities \nmay begin early, starting in the midtwenties. By their midforties, \nmost people’s eyes can no longer adjust sufficiently to focus over \n\n\n246 The Design of Everyday Things\nthe entire range of distances, so something is necessary to compen-\nsate, whether reading glasses, bifocals, special contact lenses, or \neven surgical correction.\nMany people in their eighties and nineties are still in good men-\ntal and physical shape, and the accumulated wisdom of their years \nleads to superior performance in many tasks. But physical strength \nand agility do decrease, reaction time slows, and vision and hear-\ning show impairments, along with decreased ability to divide at-\ntention or switch rapidly among competing tasks.\nFor anyone who is considering growing old, I remind you that \nalthough physical abilities diminish with age, many mental ca-\npacities continue to improve, especially those dependent upon an \nexpert accumulation of experience, deep reflection, and enhanced \nknowledge. Younger people are more agile, more willing to ex-\nperiment and take risks. Older people have more knowledge and \nwisdom. The world benefits from having a mix and so do design \nteams.\nDesigning for people with special needs is often called inclusive \nor universal design. Those names are fitting, for it is often the case that \neveryone benefits. Make the lettering larger, with high-contrast type, \nand everyone can read it better. In dim light, even the people with \nthe world’s best eyesight will benefit from such lettering. Make \nthings adjustable, and you will find that more people can use it, \nand even people who liked it before may now like it better. Just \nas I invoke the so-called error message of Figure 4.6 as my normal \nway of exiting a program because it is easier than the so-called cor-\nrect way, special features made for people with special needs often \nturn out to be useful for a wide variety of people.\nThe best solution to the problem of designing for everyone is \nflexibility: flexibility in the size of the images on computer screens, \nin the sizes, heights, and angles of tables and chairs. Allow people \nto adjust their own seats, tables, and working devices. Allow them \nto adjust lighting, font size, and contrast. Flexibility on our high-\nways might mean ensuring that there are alternative routes with \ndifferent speed limits. Fixed solutions will invariably fail with some \n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 247\npeople; flexible solutions at least offer a chance for those with dif-\nferent needs.\nComplexity Is Good; \nIt Is Confusion That Is Bad\nThe everyday kitchen is complex. We have multiple instruments \njust for serving and eating food. The typical kitchen contains all \nsorts of cutting utensils, heating units, and cooking apparatus. The \neasiest way to understand the complexity is to try to cook in an \nunfamiliar kitchen. Even excellent cooks have trouble working in \na new environment.\nSomeone else’s kitchen looks complicated and confusing, but \nyour own kitchen does not. The same can probably be said for ev-\nery room in the home. Notice that this feeling of confusion is really \none of knowledge. My kitchen looks confusing to you, but not to \nme. In turn, your kitchen looks confusing to me, but not to you. \nSo the confusion is not in the kitchen: it is in the mind. “Why can’t \nthings be made simple?” goes the cry. Well, one reason is that life \nis complex, as are the tasks we encounter. Our tools must match \nthe tasks.\nI feel so strongly about this that I wrote an entire book on the \ntopic, Living with Complexity, in which I argued that complexity \nis essential: it is confusion that is undesirable. I distinguished be-\ntween “complexity,” which we need to match the activities we take \npart in, and “complicated,” which I defined to mean “confusing.” \nHow do we avoid confusion? Ah, here is where the designer’s \nskills come into play.\nThe most important principle for taming complexity is to pro-\nvide a good conceptual model, which has already been well cov-\nered in this book. Remember the kitchen’s apparent complexity? \nThe people who use it understand why each item is stored where \nit is: there is usually structure to the apparent randomness. Even \nexceptions fit: even if the reason is something like, “It was too big \nto fit in the proper drawer and I didn’t know where else to put it,” \nthat is reason enough to give structure and understanding to the \n\n\n248 The Design of Everyday Things\nperson who stored the item there. Complex things are no longer \ncomplicated once they are understood.\nStandardization and Technology \nIf we examine the history of advances in all technological fields, \nwe see that some improvements come naturally through the tech-\nnology itself, others come through standardization. The early his-\ntory of the automobile is a good example. The first cars were very \ndifficult to operate. They required strength and skill beyond the \nabilities of many. Some problems were solved through automation: \nthe choke, the spark advance, and the starter engine. Other aspects \nof cars and driving were standardized through the long process of \ninternational standards committees:\n•  On which side of the road to drive (constant within a country, but \nvariable across countries)\n•  On which side of the car the driver sits (depends upon which side of \nthe road the car is driven)\n•  The location of essential components: steering wheel, brake, clutch, \nand accelerator (the same, whether on the left- or right-hand side of \nthe car)\nStandardization is one type of cultural constraint. With standard-\nization, once you have learned to drive one car, you feel justifiably \nconfident that you can drive any car, anyplace in the world. Stan-\ndardization provides a major breakthrough in usability.\nESTABLISHING STANDARDS\nI have enough friends on national and international standards \ncommittees to realize that the process of determining an inter-\nnationally accepted standard is laborious. Even when all parties \nagree on the merits of standardization, the task of selecting stan-\ndards becomes a lengthy, politicized issue. A small company can \nstandardize its products without too much difficulty, but it is much \nmore difficult for an industrial, national, or international body to \n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 249\nagree to standards. There even \nexists a standardized procedure \nfor establishing national and \ninternational standards. A set \nof national and international \norganizations works on stan-\ndards; when a new standard is \nproposed, it must work its way \nthrough the organizational hi-\nerarchy. Each step is complex, \nfor if there are three ways of do-\ning something, then there are \nsure to be strong proponents \nof each of the three ways, plus \npeople who will argue that it is \ntoo early to standardize.\nEach proposal is debated at the \nstandards committee meeting where it is presented, then taken back \nto the sponsoring organization—which is sometimes a company, \nsometimes a professional society—where objections and counter-\nobjections are collected. Then the standards committee meets again \nto discuss the objections. And again and again and again. Any com-\npany that is already marketing a product that meets the proposed \nstandard will have a huge economic advantage, and the debates are \ntherefore often affected as much by the economics and politics of \nthe issues as by real technological substance. The process is almost \nguaranteed to take five years, and quite often longer.\nThe resulting standard is usually a compromise among the var-\nious competing positions, oftentimes an inferior compromise. \nSometimes the answer is to agree on several incompatible stan-\ndards. Witness the existence of both metric and English units; of \nleft-hand- and right-hand-drive automobiles. There are several in-\nternational standards for the voltages and frequencies of electricity, \nand several different kinds of electrical plugs and sockets—which \ncannot be interchanged.\n4\n10\n12\n6\n2\n8\n3\n9\n11\n5\n1\n7\nFIGURE 6.4. The Nonstandard Clock. \nWhat time is it? This clock is just as log-\nical as the standard one, except the hands \nmove in the opposite direction and “12” is \nnot in its usual place. Same logic, though. \nSo why is it so difficult to read? What time \nis being displayed? 7:11, of course.\n\n\n250 The Design of Everyday Things\nWHY STANDARDS ARE NECESSARY: \nA SIMPLE ILLUSTRATION\nWith all these difficulties and with the continual advances in tech-\nnology, are standards really necessary? Yes, they are. Take the ev-\neryday clock. It’s standardized. Consider how much trouble you \nwould have telling time with a backward clock, where the hands \nrevolved “counterclockwise.” A few such clocks exist, primarily as \nhumorous conversation pieces. When a clock truly violates stan-\ndards, such as the one in Figure 6.4 on the previous page, it is dif-\nficult to determine what time is being displayed. Why? The logic \nbehind the time display is identical to that of conventional clocks: \nthere are only two differences—the hands rotate in the opposite \ndirection (counterclockwise) and the location of “12,” usually at \nthe top, has been moved. This clock is just as logical as the stan-\ndard one. It bothers us because we have standardized on a differ-\nent scheme, on the very definition of the term clockwise. Without \nsuch standardization, clock reading would be more difficult: you’d \nalways have to figure out the mapping.\nA STANDARD THAT TOOK SO LONG, \nTECHNOLOGY OVERRAN IT\nI myself participated at the very end of the incredibly long, \ncomplex political process of establishing the US standards for \nhigh-definition television. In the 1970s, the Japanese developed a \nnational television system that had much higher resolution than the \nstandards then in use: they called it “high-definition television.”\nIn 1995, two decades later, the television industry in the United \nStates proposed its own high-definition TV standard (HDTV) to the \nFederal Communications Commission (FCC). But the computer in-\ndustry pointed out that the proposals were not compatible with the \nway that computers displayed images, so the FCC objected to the \nproposed standards. Apple mobilized other members of the indus-\ntry and, as vice president of advanced technology, I was selected \nto be the spokesperson for Apple. (In the following description, \nignore the jargon—it doesn’t matter.) The TV industry proposed a \n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking \n251\nwide variety of permissible formats, including ones with rectangu-\nlar pixels and interlaced scan. Because of the technical limitations \nin the 1990s, it was suggested that the highest-quality picture have \n1,080 interlaced lines (1080i). We wanted only progressive scan, so \nwe insisted upon 720 lines, progressively displayed (720p), argu-\ning that the progressive nature of the scan made up for the lesser \nnumber of lines.\nThe battle was heated. The FCC told all the competing parties \nto lock themselves into a room and not to come out until they had \nreached agreement. As a result, I spent many hours in lawyers’ \noffices. We ended up with a crazy agreement that recognized mul-\ntiple variations of the standard, with resolutions of 480i and 480p \n(called standard definition), 720p and 1080i (called high-definition), \nand two different aspect ratios for the screens (the ratio of width to \nheight), 4:3 (= 1.3)—the old standard—and 16:9 (= 1.8)—the new \nstandard. In addition, a large number of frame rates were sup-\nported (basically, how many times per second the image was trans-\nmitted). Yes, it was a standard, or more accurately a large number \nof standards. In fact, one of the allowed methods of transmission \nwas to use any method (as long as it carried its own specifications \nalong with the signal). It was a mess, but we did reach agreement. \nAfter the standard was made official in 1996, it took roughly ten \nmore years for HDTV to become accepted, helped, finally, by a \nnew generation of television displays that were large, thin, and in-\nexpensive. The whole process took roughly thirty-five years from \nthe first broadcasts by the Japanese.\nWas it worth the fight? Yes and no. In the thirty-five years that it \ntook to reach the standard, the technology continued to evolve, so \nthe resulting standard was far superior to the first one proposed \nso many years before. Moreover, the HDTV of today is a huge im-\nprovement over what we had before (now called “standard defini-\ntion”). But the minutiae of details that were the focus of the fight \nbetween the computer and TV companies was silly. My technical \nexperts continually tried to demonstrate to me the superiority of \n720p images over 1080i, but it took me hours of viewing special \n\n\n252 The Design of Everyday Things\nscenes under expert guidance to see the deficiencies of the inter-\nlaced images (the differences only show up with complex moving \nimages). So why did we care?\nTelevision displays and compression techniques have improved \nso much that interlacing is no longer needed. Images at 1080p, \nonce thought to be impossible, are now commonplace. Sophisti-\ncated algorithms and high-speed processors make it possible to \ntransform one standard into another; even rectangular pixels are \nno longer a problem.\nAs I write these words, the main problem is the discrepancy in \naspect ratios. Movies come in many different aspect ratios (none \nof them the new standard) so when TV screens show movies, they \neither have to cut off part of the image or leave parts of the screen \nblack. Why was the HDTV aspect ratio set at 16:9 (or 1.8) if no \nmovies used that ratio? Because engineers liked it: square the old \naspect ratio of 4:3 and you get the new one, 16:9.\nToday we are about to embark on yet another standards fight \nover TV. First, there is three-dimensional TV: 3-D. Then there are \nproposals for ultra-high definition: 2,160 lines (and a doubling of \nthe horizontal resolution as well): four times the resolution of our \nbest TV today (1080p). One company wants eight times the resolu-\ntion, and one is proposing an aspect ratio of 21:9 (= 2.3). I have seen \nthese images and they are marvelous, although they only matter \nwith large screens (at least 60 inches, or 1.5 meters, in diagonal \nlength), and when the viewer is close to the display.\nStandards can take so long to be established that by the time they \ndo come into wide practice, they can be irrelevant. Nonetheless, \nstandards are necessary. They simplify our lives and make it possi-\nble for different brands of equipment to work together in harmony. \nA STANDARD THAT NEVER \nCAUGHT ON: DIGITAL TIME\nStandardize and you simplify lives: everyone learns the system \nonly once. But don’t standardize too soon; you may be locked into \na primitive technology, or you may have introduced rules that turn \nout to be grossly inefficient, even error-inducing. Standardize too \n",

If there is agreement \non an old-fashioned technology, it may be too expensive for every-\none to change to the new standard. The metric system is a good ex-\nample: it is a far simpler and more usable scheme for representing \ndistance, weight, volume, and temperature than the older English \nsystem of feet, pounds, seconds, and degrees on the Fahrenheit \nscale. But industrial nations with a heavy commitment to the old \nmeasurement standard claim they cannot afford the massive costs \nand confusion of conversion. So we are stuck with two standards, \nat least for a few more decades.\nWould you consider changing how we specify time? The cur-\nrent system is arbitrary. The day is divided into twenty-four rather \narbitrary but standard units—hours. But we tell time in units of \ntwelve, not twenty-four, so there have to be two cycles of twelve \nhours each, plus the special convention of a.m. and p.m. so we \nknow which cycle we are talking about. Then we divide each hour \ninto sixty minutes and each minute into sixty seconds.\nWhat if we switched to metric divisions: seconds divided into \ntenths, milliseconds, and microseconds? We would have days, mil-\nlidays, and microdays. There would have to be a new hour, min-\nute, and second: call them the digital hour, the digital minute, and \nthe digital second. It would be easy: ten digital hours to the day, \none hundred digital minutes to the digital hour, one hundred dig-\nital seconds to the digital minute.\nEach digital hour would last exactly 2.4 times an old hour: 144 \nold minutes. So the old one-hour period of the schoolroom or \ntelevision program would be replaced with a half-digital hour \nperiod, or 50 digital minutes—only 20 percent longer than the \ncurrent hour. We could adapt to the differences in durations with \nrelative ease.\nWhat do I think of it? I much prefer it. After all, the decimal sys-\ntem, the basis of most of the world’s use of numbers and arithme-\ntic, uses base 10 arithmetic and, as a result, arithmetic operations \nare much simpler in the metric system. Many societies have used \nother systems, 12 and 60 being common. Hence twelve for the \n\n\n254 The Design of Everyday Things\nnumber of items in a dozen, inches in a foot, hours in a day, and \nmonths in a year; sixty for the number of seconds in a minute, sec-\nonds in a degree, and minutes in an hour.\nThe French proposed that time be made into a decimal system \nin 1792, during the French Revolution, when the major shift to the \nmetric system took place. The metric system for weights and lengths \ntook hold, but not for time. Decimal time was used long enough for \ndecimal clocks to be manufactured, but it eventually was discarded. \nToo bad. It is very difficult to change well-established habits. We \nstill use the QWERTY keyboard, and the United States still measures \nthings in inches and feet, yards and miles, Fahrenheit, ounces, and \npounds. The world still measures time in units of 12 and 60, and \ndivides the circle into 360 degrees.\nIn 1998, Swatch, the Swiss watch company, made its own attempt \nto introduce decimal time through what it called “Swatch Inter-\nnational Time.” Swatch divided the day into 1,000 “.beats,” each \n.beat being slightly less than 90 seconds (each .beat corresponds to \none digital minute). This system did not use time zones, so people \nthe world over would be in synchrony with their watches. This \ndoes not simplify the problem of synchronizing scheduled con-\nversations, however, because it would be difficult to get the sun \nto behave properly. People would still wish to wake up around \nsunrise, and this would occur at different Swatch times around the \nworld. As a result, even though people would have their watches \nsynchronized, it would still be necessary to know when they woke \nup, ate, went to and from work, and went to sleep, and these times \nwould vary around the world. It isn’t clear whether Swatch was \nserious with its proposal or whether it was one huge advertising \nstunt. After a few years of publicity, during which the company \nmanufactured digital watches that told the time in .beats, it all fiz-\nzled away.\nSpeaking of standardization, Swatch called its basic time unit a \n“.beat” with the first character being a period. This nonstandard \nspelling wreaks havoc on spelling correction systems that aren’t set \nup to handle words that begin with punctuation marks.\n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 255\nDeliberately Making Things Difficult\nHow can good design (design that is usable and understandable) be \nbalanced with the need for “secrecy” or privacy, or protection? That \nis, some applications of design involve areas that are sensitive and ne-\ncessitate strict control over who uses and understands them. Perhaps \nwe don’t want any user-in-the-street to understand enough of a sys-\ntem to compromise its security. Couldn’t it be argued that some things \nshouldn’t be designed well? Can’t things be left cryptic, so that only \nthose who have clearance, extended education, or whatever, can make \nuse of the system? Sure, we have passwords, keys, and other types of \nsecurity checks, but this can become wearisome for the privileged user. It \nappears that if good design is not ignored in some contexts, the purpose \nfor the existence of the system will be nullified. (A computer mail question \nsent to me by a student, Dina Kurktchi. It is just the right question.)\nIn Stapleford, England, I came across a school door that was very \ndifficult to open, requiring simultaneous operation of two latches, \none at the very top of the door, the other down low. The latches \nwere difficult to find, to reach, and to use. But the difficulties were \ndeliberate. This was good design. The door was at a school for \nhandicapped children, and the school didn’t want the children to \nbe able to get out to the street without an adult. Only adults were \nlarge enough to operate the two latches. Violating the rules of \nease of use is just what was needed.\nMost things are intended to be easy to use, but aren’t. But some \nthings are deliberately difficult to use—and ought to be. The \nnumber of things that should be difficult to use is surprisingly \nlarge:\n• Any door designed to keep people in or out.\n•  Security systems, designed so that only authorized people will be \nable to use them.\n• Dangerous equipment, which should be restricted.\n•  Dangerous operations that might lead to death or injury if done ac-\ncidentally or in error. \n\n\n256 The Design of Everyday Things\n•  Secret doors, cabinets, and safes: you don’t want the average person \neven to know that they are there, let alone to be able to work them.\n•  Cases deliberately intended to disrupt the normal routine action (as \ndiscussed in Chapter 5). Examples include the acknowledgment re-\nquired before permanently deleting a file from a computer, safeties \non pistols and rifles, and pins in fire extinguishers.\n•  Controls that require two simultaneous actions before the system will \noperate, with the controls separated so that it takes two people to \nwork them, preventing a single person from doing an unauthorized \naction (used in security systems or safety-critical operations). \n•  Cabinets and bottles for medications and dangerous substances de-\nliberately made difficult to open to keep them secure from children.\n•  Games, a category in which designers deliberately flout the laws of \nunderstandability and usability. Games are meant to be difficult; in \nsome games, part of the challenge is to figure out what is to be done, \nand how.\nEven where a lack of usability or understandability is deliberate, \nit is still important to know the rules of understandable and usable \ndesign, for two reasons. First, even deliberately difficult designs \naren’t entirely difficult. Usually there is one difficult part, designed \nto keep unauthorized people from using the device; the rest of it \nshould follow the normal principles of good design. Second, even \nif your job is to make something difficult to do, you need to know \nhow to go about doing it. In this case, the rules are useful, for they \nstate in reverse just how to go about the task. You could systemat-\nically violate the rules like this:\n•  Hide critical components: make things invisible.\n•  Use unnatural mappings for the execution side of the action cycle, so \nthat the relationship of the controls to the things being controlled is \ninappropriate or haphazard.\n•  Make the actions physically difficult to do.\n•  Require precise timing and physical manipulation.\n•  Do not give any feedback.\n\n\n \nsix: Design Thinking 257\n•  Use unnatural mappings for the evaluation side of the action cycle, \nso that system state is difficult to interpret.\nSafety systems pose a special problem in design. Oftentimes, the \ndesign feature added to ensure safety eliminates one danger, only \nto create a secondary one. When workers dig a hole in a street, \nthey must put up barriers to prevent cars and people from falling \ninto the hole. The barriers solve one problem, but they themselves \npose another danger, often mitigated by adding signs and flashing \nlights to warn of the barriers. Emergency doors, lights, and alarms \nmust often be accompanied by warning signs or barriers that con-\ntrol when and how they can be used.\nDesign: Developing Technology for People\nDesign is a marvelous discipline, bringing together technology and \npeople, business and politics, culture and commerce. The different \npressures on design are severe, presenting huge challenges to the \ndesigner. At the same time, the designers must always keep fore-\nmost in mind that the products are to be used by people. This is \nwhat makes design such a rewarding discipline: On the one hand, \nwoefully complex constraints to overcome; on the other hand, the \nopportunity to develop things that assist and enrich the lives of \npeople, that bring benefits and enjoyment.\n\n\n258 \nDESIGN \nIN THE \nWORLD OF \nBUSINESS\nThe realities of the world impose severe constraints \nupon the design of products. Up to now I have de-\nscribed the ideal case, assuming that human-centered \ndesign principles could be followed in a vacuum; that \nis, without attention to the real world of competition, costs, and \nschedules. Conflicting requirements will come from different \nsources, all of which are legitimate, all of which need to be resolved. \nCompromises must be made by all involved.\nNow it is time to examine the concerns outside of human-\ncentered design that affect the development of products. I start \nwith the impact of competitive forces that drive the introduction \nof extra features, often to excess: the cause of the disease dubbed \n“featuritis,” whose major symptom is “creeping featurism.” From \nthere, I examine the drivers of change, starting with technological \ndrivers. When new technologies emerge, there is a temptation to \ndevelop new products immediately. But the time for radically new \nproducts to become successful is measured in years, decades, or \nin some instances centuries. This causes me to examine the two \nforms of product innovation relevant to design: incremental (less \nglamorous, but most common) and radical (most glamorous, but \nrarely successful). \nC H A P T E R  S E V E N\n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 259\nI conclude with reflections about the history and future prospects \nof this book. The first edition of this book has had a long and fruit-\nful life. Twenty-five years is an amazingly long time for a book cen-\ntered around technology to have remained relevant. If this revised \nand expanded edition lasts an equally long time, that means fifty \nyears of The Design of Everyday Things. In these next twenty-five \nyears, what new developments will take place? What will be the \nrole of technology in our lives, for the future of books, and what \nare the moral obligations of the design profession? And finally, for \nhow long will the principles in this book remain relevant? It should \nbe no surprise that I believe they will always be just as relevant as \nthey were twenty-five years ago, just as relevant as they are today. \nWhy? The reason is simple. The design of technology to fit human \nneeds and capabilities is determined by the psychology of people. \nYes, technologies may change, but people stay the same.\nCompetitive Forces\nToday, manufacturers around the world compete with one another. \nThe competitive pressures are severe. After all, there are only a \nfew basic ways by which a manufacturer can compete: three of the \nmost important being price, features, and quality—unfortunately \noften in that order of importance. Speed is important, lest some \nother company get ahead in the rush for market presence. These \npressures make it difficult to follow the full, iterative process of \ncontinual product improvement. Even relatively stable home prod-\nucts, such as automobiles, kitchen appliances, television sets, and \ncomputers, face the multiple forces of a competitive market that \nencourage the introduction of changes without sufficient testing \nand refinement.\nHere is a simple, real example. I am working with a new startup \ncompany, developing an innovative line of cooking equipment. \nThe founders had some unique ideas, pushing the technology of \ncooking far ahead of anything available for homes. We did numer-\nous field tests, built numerous prototypes, and engaged a world-\nclass industrial designer. We modified the original product concept \nseveral times, based on early feedback from potential users and \n\n\n260 The Design of Everyday Things\nadvice from industry experts. But just as we were about to com-\nmission the first production of a few hand-tooled working proto-\ntypes that could be shown to potential investors and customers (an \nexpensive proposition for the small self-funded company), other \ncompanies started displaying similar concepts in the trade shows. \nWhat? Did they steal the ideas? No, it’s what is called the Zeit-\ngeist, a German word meaning “spirit of the time.” In other words, \nthe time was ripe, the ideas were “in the air.” The competition \nemerged even before we had delivered our first product. What is \na small, startup company to do? It doesn’t have money to compete \nwith the large companies. It has to modify its ideas to keep ahead \nof the competition and come up with a demonstration that excites \npotential customers and wows potential investors and, more im-\nportantly, potential distributors of the product. It is the distributors \nwho are the real customers, not the people who eventually buy the \nproduct in stores and use it in their homes. The example illustrates \nthe real business pressures on companies: the need for speed, the \nconcern about costs, the competition that may force the company \nto change its offerings, and the need to satisfy several classes of \ncustomers—investors, distributors, and, of course, the people who \nwill actually use the product. Where should the company focus its \nlimited resources? More user studies? Faster development? New, \nunique features?\nThe same pressures that the startup faced also impact established \ncompanies. But they have other pressures as well. Most products \nhave a development cycle of one to two years. In order to bring out \na new model every year, the design process for the new model has \nto have started even before the previous model has been released \nto customers. Moreover, mechanisms for collecting and feeding \nback the experiences of customers seldom exist. In an earlier era, \nthere was close coupling between designers and users. Today, they \nare separated by barriers. Some companies prohibit designers from \nworking with customers, a bizarre and senseless restriction. Why \nwould they do this? In part to prevent leaks of the new develop-\nments to the competition, but also in part because customers may \n",

But even where there \nare no such restrictions, the complexity of large organizations cou-\npled with the relentless pressure to finish the product makes this \ninteraction difficult. Remember Norman’s Law of Chapter 6: The \nday a product development process starts, it is behind schedule \nand above budget.\nFEATURITIS: A DEADLY TEMPTATION\nIn every successful product there lurks the carrier of an insidious \ndisease called “featuritis,” with its main symptom being “creep-\ning featurism.” The disease seems to have been first identified and \nnamed in 1976, but its origins probably go back to the earliest tech-\nnologies, buried far back in the eons prior to the dawn of history. \nIt seems unavoidable, with no known prevention. Let me explain.\nSuppose we follow all the principles in this book for a wonder-\nful, human-centered product. It obeys all design principles. It over-\ncomes people’s problems and fulfills some important needs. It is \nattractive and easy to use and understand. As a result, suppose the \nproduct is successful: many people buy it and tell their friends to \nbuy it. What could be wrong with this?\nThe problem is that after the product has been available for a \nwhile, a number of factors inevitably appear, pushing the company \ntoward the addition of new features—toward creeping featurism. \nThese factors include:\n•  Existing customers like the product, but express a wish for more fea-\ntures, more functions, more capability.\n•  A competing company adds new features to its products, producing \ncompetitive pressures to match that offering, but to do even more in \norder to get ahead of the competition.\n•  Customers are satisfied, but sales are declining because the market \nis saturated: everyone who wants the product already has it. Time to \nadd wonderful enhancements that will cause people to want the new \nmodel, to upgrade.\n\n\n262 The Design of Everyday Things\nFeaturitis is highly infectious. New products are invariably more \ncomplex, more powerful, and different in size than the first release \nof a product. You can see that tension playing out in music players, \nmobile phones, and computers, especially on smart phones, tab-\nlets, and pads. Portable devices get smaller and smaller with each \nrelease, despite the addition of more and more features (making \nthem ever more difficult to operate). Some products, such as au-\ntomobiles, home refrigerators, television sets, and kitchen stoves, \nalso increase in complexity with each release, getting larger and \nmore powerful.\nBut whether the products get larger or smaller, each new edition \ninvariably has more features than the previous one. Featuritis is \nan insidious disease, difficult to eradicate, impossible to vaccinate \nagainst. It is easy for marketing pressures to insist upon the addition \nof new features, but there is no call—or for that matter, budget—to \nget rid of old, unneeded ones.\nHow do you know when you have encountered featuritis? By \nits major symptom: creeping featurism. Want an example? Look \nat Figure 7.1, which illustrates the changes that have overcome the \nsimple Lego motorcycle since my first encounter with it for the first \nedition of this book. The original motorcycle (Figure 4.1 and Figure \n7.1A) had only fifteen components and could be put together with-\nout any instructions: it had sufficient constraints that every piece \nhad a unique location and orientation. But now, as Figure 7.1B \nshows, the same motorcycle has become bloated, with twenty-nine \npieces. I needed instructions.\nCreeping featurism is the tendency to add to the number of fea-\ntures of a product, often extending the number beyond all reason. \nThere is no way that a product can remain usable and understand-\nable by the time it has all of those special-purpose features that \nhave been added in over time.\nIn her book Different, Harvard professor Youngme Moon ar-\ngues that it is this attempt to match the competition that causes all \nproducts to be the same. When companies try to increase sales by \nmatching every feature of their competitors, they end up hurting \nthemselves. After all, when products from two companies match \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 263\nfeature by feature, there is no longer any reason for a customer to \nprefer one over another. This is competition-driven design. Unfor-\ntunately, the mind-set of matching the competitor’s list of features \npervades many organizations. Even if the first versions of a prod-\nuct are well done, human-centered, and focused upon real needs, \nit is the rare organization that is content to let a good product stay \nuntouched.\nMost companies compare features with their competition to de-\ntermine where they are weak, so they can strengthen those areas. \nWrong, argues Moon. A better strategy is to concentrate on areas \nwhere they are stronger and to strengthen them even more. Then \nfocus all marketing and advertisements to point out the strong \npoints. This causes the product to stand out from the mindless \nherd. As for the weaknesses, ignore the irrelevant ones, says Moon. \nThe lesson is simple: don’t follow blindly; focus on strengths, not \nweaknesses. If the product has real strengths, it can afford to just \nbe “good enough” in the other areas.\nGood design requires stepping back from competitive pressures \nand ensuring that the entire product be consistent, coherent, and \nFIGURE 7.1. Featuritis Strikes Lego. Figure A shows the original Lego Motorcycle \navailable in 1988 when I used it in the first edition of this book (on the left), next to the \n2013 version (on the right). The old version had only fifteen pieces. No manual was \nneeded to put it together. For the new version, the box proudly proclaims “29 pieces.” \nI could put the original version together without instructions. Figure B shows how far \nI got with the new version before I gave up and had to consult the instruction sheet. \nWhy did Lego believe it had to change the motorcycle? Perhaps because featuritis \nstruck real police motorcycles, causing them to increase in size and complexity and \nLego felt that its toy needed to match the world. (Photographs by the author.)\nA.\nB.\n\n\n264 The Design of Everyday Things\nunderstandable. This stance requires the leadership of the com-\npany to withstand the marketing forces that keep begging to add \nthis feature or that, each thought to be essential for some market \nsegment. The best products come from ignoring these competing \nvoices and instead focusing on the true needs of the people who \nuse the product.\nJeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon.com, calls his ap-\nproach “customer obsessed.” Everything is focused upon the re-\nquirements of Amazon’s customers. The competition is ignored, \nthe traditional marketing requirements are ignored. The focus is on \nsimple, customer-driven questions: what do the customers want; \nhow can their needs best be satisfied; what can be done better to \nenhance customer service and customer value? Focus on the cus-\ntomer, Bezos argues, and the rest takes care of itself. Many compa-\nnies claim to aspire to this philosophy, but few are able to follow \nit. Usually it is only possible where the head of the company, the \nCEO, is also the founder. Once the company passes control to oth-\ners, especially those who follow the traditional MBA dictum of \nputting profit above customer concerns, the story goes downhill. \nProfits may indeed increase in the short term, but eventually the \nproduct quality deteriorates to the point where customers desert. \nQuality only comes about by continual focus on, and attention to, \nthe people who matter: customers.\nNew Technologies Force Change \nToday, we have new requirements. We now need to type on small, \nportable devices that don’t have room for a full keyboard. Touch- \nand gesture-sensitive screens allow a new form of typing. We can \nbypass typing altogether through handwriting recognition and \nspeech understanding.\nConsider the four products shown in Figure 7.2. Their appear-\nance and methods of operations changed radically in their century \nof existence. Early telephones, such as the one in Figure 7.2A, did \nnot have keyboards: a human operator intervened to make the con-\nnections. Even when operators were first replaced by automatic \nswitching systems, the “keyboard” was a rotary dial with ten holes, \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 265\none for each digit. When the dial was replaced with pushbutton \nkeys, it suffered a slight case of featuritis: the ten positions of the \ndial were replaced with twelve keys: the ten digits plus * and #.\nBut much more interesting is the merger of devices. The human \ncomputer gave rise to laptops, small portable computers. The tele-\nphone moved to small, portable cellular phones (called mobiles \nin much of the world). Smart phones had large, touch-sensitive \nscreens, operated by gesture. Soon computers merged into tab-\nlets, as did cell phones. Cameras merged with cell phones. Today, \ntalking, video conferences, writing, photography (both still and \nvideo), and collaborative interaction of all sorts are increasingly \nFIGURE 7.2. 100 Years of Telephones and Keyboards. Figures A and B show the \nchange in the telephone from the Western Electric crank telephone of the 1910s, where \nrotating the crank on the right generated a signal alerting the operator, to the phone of \nthe 2010s. They seem to have nothing in common. Figures C and D contrast a keyboard \nof the 1910s with one from the 2010s. The keyboards are still laid out in the same way, \nbut the first requires physical depression of each key; the second, a quick tracing of a \nfinger over the relevant letters (the image shows the word many being entered).

It doesn’t make \nsense to call them computers, phones, or cameras: we need a new \nname. Let’s call them “smart screens.” In the twenty-second cen-\ntury, will we still have phones? I predict that although we will still \ntalk with one another over a distance, we will not have any device \ncalled a telephone.\nAs the pressures for larger screens forced the demise of physi-\ncal keyboards (despite the attempt to make tiny keyboards, oper-\nated with single fingers or thumbs), the keyboards were displayed \non the screen whenever needed, each letter tapped one at a time. \nThis is slow, even when the system tries to predict the word being \ntyped so that keying can stop as soon as the correct word shows \nup. Several systems were soon developed that allowed the finger or \nstylus to trace a path among the letters of the word: word-gesture \nsystems. The gestures were sufficiently different from one another \nthat it wasn’t even necessary to touch all the letters—it only mat-\ntered that the pattern generated by the approximation to the cor-\nrect path was close enough to the desired one. This turns out to be \na fast and easy way to type (Figure 7.2D).\nWith gesture-based systems, a major rethinking is possible. Why \nkeep the letters in the same QWERTY arrangement? The pattern \ngeneration would be even faster if letters were rearranged to max-\nimize speed when using a single finger or stylus to trace out the \nletters. Good idea, but when one of the pioneers in developing this \ntechnique, Shumin Zhai, then at IBM, tried it, he ran into the legacy \nproblem. People knew QWERTY and balked at having to learn a \ndifferent organization. Today, the word-gesture method of typing \nis widely used, but with QWERTY keyboards (as in Figure 7.2D).\nTechnology changes the way we do things, but fundamental \nneeds remain unchanged. The need for getting thoughts written \ndown, for telling stories, doing critical reviews, or writing fiction \nand nonfiction will remain. Some will be written using traditional \nkeyboards, even on new technological devices, because the key-\nboard still remains the fastest way to enter words into a system, \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 267\nwhether it be paper or electronic, physical or virtual. Some people \nwill prefer to speak their ideas, dictating them. But spoken words \nare still likely to be turned into printed words (even if the print \nis simply on a display device), because reading is far faster and \nsuperior to listening. Reading can be done quickly: it is possible to \nread around three hundred words per minute and to skim, jump-\ning ahead and back, effectively acquiring information at rates in \nthe thousands of words per minute. Listening is slow and serial, \nusually at around sixty words per minute, and although this rate \ncan be doubled or tripled with speech compression technologies \nand training, it is still slower than reading and not easy to skim. \nBut the new media and new technologies will supplement the old, \nso that writing will no longer dominate as much as it did in the \npast, when it was the only medium widely available. Now that \nanyone can type and dictate, take photographs and videos, draw \nanimated scenes, and creatively produce experiences that in the \ntwentieth century required huge amounts of technology and large \ncrews of specialized workers, the types of devices that allow us to \ndo these tasks and the ways they are controlled will proliferate.\nThe role of writing in civilization has changed over its five thou-\nsand years of existence. Today, writing has become increasingly \ncommon, although increasingly as short, informal messages. We \nnow communicate using a wide variety of media: voice, video, \nhandwriting, and typing, sometimes with all ten fingers, some-\ntimes just with the thumbs, and sometimes by gestures. Over time, \nthe ways by which we interact and communicate change with tech-\nnology. But because the fundamental psychology of human beings \nwill remain unchanged, the design rules in this book will still apply.\nOf course, it isn’t just communication and writing that has \nchanged. Technological change has impacted every sphere of our \nlives, from the way education is conducted, to medicine, foods, \nclothing, and transportation. We now can manufacture things at \nhome, using 3-D printers. We can play games with partners around \nthe world. Cars are capable of driving themselves, and their en-\ngines have changed from internal combustion to an assortment of \n\n\n268 The Design of Everyday Things\npure electric and hybrids. Name an industry or an activity and if \nit hasn’t already been transformed by new technologies, it will be.\nTechnology is a powerful driver for change. Sometimes for the \nbetter, sometimes for the worse. Sometimes to fulfill important \nneeds, and sometimes simply because the technology makes the \nchange possible.\nHow Long Does It Take \nto Introduce a New Product?\nHow long does it take for an idea to become a product? And after \nthat, how long before the product becomes a long-lasting success? \nInventors and founders of startup companies like to think the in-\nterval from idea to success is a single process, with the total mea-\nsured in months. In fact, it is multiple processes, where the total \ntime is measured in decades, sometimes centuries.\nTechnology changes rapidly, but people and culture change \nslowly. Change is, therefore, simultaneously rapid and slow. It can \ntake months to go from invention to product, but then decades—\nsometimes many decades—for the product to get accepted. Older \nproducts linger on long after they should have become obsolete, \nlong after they should have disappeared. Much of daily life is dic-\ntated by conventions that are centuries old, that no longer make \nany sense, and whose origins have been forgotten by all except the \nhistorian.\nEven our most modern technologies follow this time cycle: fast \nto be invented, slow to be accepted, even slower to fade away and \ndie. In the early 2000s, the commercial introduction of gestural con-\ntrol for cell phones, tablets, and computers radically transformed \nthe way we interacted with our devices. Whereas all previous elec-\ntronic devices had numerous knobs and buttons on the outside, \nphysical keyboards, and ways of calling up numerous menus of \ncommands, scrolling through them, and selecting the desired \ncommand, the new devices eliminated almost all physical controls \nand menus.\nWas the development of tablets controlled by gestures rev-\nolutionary? To most people, yes, but not to technologists. \n",

The first devices were developed by the \nUniversity of Toronto in the early 1980s. Mitsubishi developed a \nproduct that it sold to design schools and research laboratories, \nin which many of today’s gestures and techniques were being ex-\nplored. Why did it take so long for these multitouch devices to be-\ncome successful products? Because it took decades to transform \nthe research technology into components that were inexpensive \nand reliable enough for everyday products. Numerous small \ncompanies tried to manufacture screens, but the first devices \nthat could handle multiple touches were either very expensive \nor unreliable.\nThere is another problem: the general conservatism of large com-\npanies. Most radical ideas fail: large companies are not tolerant \nof failure. Small companies can jump in with new, exciting ideas \nbecause if they fail, well, the cost is relatively low. In the world of \nhigh technology, many people get new ideas, gather together a few \nfriends and early risk-seeking employees, and start a new com-\npany to exploit their visions. Most of these companies fail. Only a \nfew will be successful, either by growing into a larger company or \nby being purchased by a large company.\nYou may be surprised by the large percentage of failures, but \nthat is only because they are not publicized: we only hear about \nthe tiny few that become successful. Most startup companies fail, \nbut failure in the high-tech world of California is not considered \nbad. In fact, it is considered a badge of honor, for it means that \nthe company saw a future potential, took the risk, and tried. Even \nthough the company failed, the employees learned lessons that \nmake their next attempt more likely to succeed. Failure can occur \nfor many reasons: perhaps the marketplace is not ready; perhaps \nthe technology is not ready for commercialization; perhaps the \ncompany runs out of money before it can gain traction.\nWhen one early startup company, Fingerworks, was struggling \nto develop an affordable, reliable touch surface that distinguished \n\n\n270 The Design of Everyday Things\namong multiple fingers, it almost quit because it was about to run \nout of money. Apple however, anxious to get into this market, \nbought Fingerworks. When it became part of Apple, its financial \nneeds were met and Fingerworks technology became the driving \nforce behind Apple’s new products. Today, devices controlled by \ngestures are everywhere, so this type of interaction seems natural \nand obvious, but at the time, it was neither natural nor obvious. \nIt took almost three decades from the invention of multitouch \nbefore companies were able to manufacture the technology with \nthe required robustness, versatility, and very low cost necessary \nfor the idea to be deployed in the home consumer market. Ideas \ntake a long time to traverse the distance from conception to suc-\ncessful product.\nVIDEOPHONE: \nCONCEIVED IN 1879—STILL NOT HER E\nThe Wikipedia article on videophones, from which Figure 7.3 \nwas taken, said: “George du Maurier’s cartoon of ‘an electric cam-\nera-obscura’ is often cited as an early prediction of television and \nalso anticipated the videophone, in wide screen formats and flat \nscreens.” Although the title of the drawing gives credit to Thomas \nEdison, he had nothing to do with this. This is sometimes called \nStigler’s law: the names of famous people often get attached to \nideas even though they had nothing to do with them.\nThe world of product design offers many examples of Stigler’s \nlaw. Products are thought to be the invention of the company that \nmost successfully capitalized upon the idea, not the company that \noriginated it. In the world of products, original ideas are the easy \npart. Actually producing the idea as a successful product is what \nis hard. Consider the idea of a video conversation. Thinking of the \nidea was so easy that, as we see in Figure 7.3, Punch magazine illus-\ntrator du Maurier could draw a picture of what it might look like \nonly two years after the telephone was invented. The fact that he \ncould do this probably meant that the idea was already circulating. \nBy the late 1890s, Alexander Graham Bell had thought through a \nnumber of the design issues. But the wonderful scenario illustrated \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business \n271\nby du Maurier has still not become reality, one and one-half centu-\nries later. Today, the videophone is barely getting established as a \nmeans of everyday communication.\nIt is extremely difficult to develop all the details required to en-\nsure that a new idea works, to say nothing of finding components \nthat can be manufactured in sufficient quantity, reliability, and af-\nfordability. With a brand-new concept, it can take decades before \nthe public will endorse it. Inventors often believe their new ideas \nwill revolutionize the world in months, but reality is harsher. Most \nnew inventions fail, and even the few that succeed take decades \nto do so. Yes, even the ones we consider “fast.” Most of the time, \nthe technology is unnoticed by the public as it circulates around \nthe research laboratories of the world or is tried by a few unsuc-\ncessful startup companies or adventurous early adopters.\nFIGURE 7.3 Predicting the Future: The Videophone in 1879. The caption reads: \n“Edison’s Telephonoscope (transmits light as well as sound). (Every evening, before go-\ning to bed, Pater- and Materfamilias set up an electric camera-obscura over their bedroom \nmantel-piece, and gladden their eyes with the sight of their children at the Antipodes, and \nconverse gaily with them through the wire.”) (Published in the December 9, 1878, issue of Punch \nmagazine. From “Telephonoscope,” Wikipedia.) \n\n\n272 The Design of Everyday Things\nIdeas that are too early often fail, even if eventually others in-\ntroduce them successfully. I’ve seen this happen several times. \nWhen I first joined Apple, I watched as it released one of the very \nfirst commercial digital cameras: the Apple QuickTake. It failed. \nProbably you are unaware that Apple ever made cameras. It failed \nbecause the technology was limited, the price high, and the world \nsimply wasn’t ready to dismiss film and chemical processing of \nphotographs. I was an adviser to a startup company that produced \nthe world’s first digital picture frame. It failed. Once again, the \ntechnology didn’t quite support it and the product was relatively \nexpensive. Obviously today, digital cameras and digital photo \nframes are extremely successful products, but neither Apple nor \nthe startup I worked with are part of the story.\nEven as digital cameras started to gain a foothold in photog-\nraphy, it took several decades before they displaced film for still \nphotographs. It is taking even longer to replace film-based mov-\nies with those produced on digital cameras. As I write this, only a \nsmall number of films are made digitally, and only a small number \nof theaters project digitally. How long has the effort been going on? \nIt is difficult to determine when the effort stated, but it has been \na very long time. It took decades for high-definition television to \nreplace the standard, very poor resolution of the previous genera-\ntion (NTSC in the United States and PAL and SECAM elsewhere). \nWhy so long to get to a far better picture, along with far better \nsound? People are very conservative. Broadcasting stations would \nhave to replace all their equipment. Homeowners would need new \nsets. Overall, the only people who push for changes of this sort are \nthe technology enthusiasts and the equipment manufacturers. A \nbitter fight between the television broadcasters and the computer \nindustry, each of which wanted different standards, also delayed \nadoption (described in Chapter 6).\nIn the case of the videophone shown in Figure 7.3, the illus-\ntration is wonderful but the details are strangely lacking. Where \nwould the video camera have to be located to display that won-\nderful panorama of the children playing? Notice that “Pater- and \nMaterfamilias” are sitting in the dark (because the video image is \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 273\nprojected by a “camera obscura,” which has a very weak output). \nWhere is the video camera that films the parents, and if they sit \nin the dark, how can they be visible? It is also interesting that al-\nthough the video quality looks even better than we could achieve \ntoday, sound is still being picked up by trumpet-shaped telephones \nwhose users need to hold the speaking tube to their face and talk \n(probably loudly). Thinking of the concept of a video connection \nwas relatively easy. Thinking through the details has been very dif-\nficult, and then being able to build it and put it into practice—well, \nit is now considerably over a century since that picture was drawn \nand we are just barely able to fulfill that dream. Barely.\nIt took forty years for the first working videophones to be cre-\nated (in the 1920s), then another ten years before the first product \n(in the mid-1930s, in Germany), which failed. The United States \ndidn’t try commercial videophone service until the 1960s, thirty \nyears after Germany; that service also failed. All sorts of ideas have \nbeen tried including dedicated videophone instruments, devices \nusing the home television set, video conferencing with home per-\nsonal computers, special video-conferencing rooms in universities \nand companies, and small video telephones, some of which might \nbe worn on the wrist. It took until the start of the twenty-first cen-\ntury for usage to pick up.\nVideo conferencing finally started to become common in the \nearly 2010s. Extremely expensive videoconferencing suites have \nbeen set up in businesses and universities. The best commercial \nsystems make it seem as if you are in the same room with the \ndistant participants, using high-quality transmission of images \nand multiple, large monitors to display life-size images of people \nsitting across the table (one company, Cisco, even sells the table). \nThis is 140 years from the first published conception, 90 years \nsince the first practical demonstration, and 80 years since the first \ncommercial release. Moreover, the cost, both for the equipment \nat each location and for the data-transmission charges, are much \nhigher than the average person or business can afford: right now \nthey are mostly used in corporate offices. Many people today do \nengage in videoconferencing from their smart display devices, \n\n\n274 The Design of Everyday Things\nbut the experience is not nearly as good as provided by the best \ncommercial facilities. Nobody would confuse these experiences \nwith being in the same room as the participants, something that \nthe highest-quality commercial facilities aspire to (with remark-\nable success).\nEvery modern innovation, especially the ones that significantly \nchange lives, takes multiple decades to move from concept to com-\npany success A rule of thumb is twenty years from first demon-\nstrations in research laboratories to commercial product, and \nthen a decade or two from first commercial release to widespread \nadoption. Except that actually, most innovations fail completely \nand never reach the public. Even ideas that are excellent and will \neventually succeed frequently fail when first introduced. I’ve been \nassociated with a number of products that failed upon introduc-\ntion, only to be very successful later when reintroduced (by other \ncompanies), the real difference being the timing. Products that \nfailed at first commercial introduction include the first American \nautomobile (Duryea), the first typewriters, the first digital cameras, \nand the first home computers (for example, the Altair 8800 com-\nputer of 1975).\nTHE LONG PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT \nOF THE TYPEWRITER KEYBOARD\nThe typewriter is an ancient mechanical device, now found mostly \nin museums, although still in use in newly developing nations. \nIn addition to having a fascinating history, it illustrates the diffi-\nculties of introducing new products into society, the influence of \nmarketing upon design, and the long, difficult path leading to new \nproduct acceptance. The history affects all of us because the type-\nwriter provided the world with the arrangement of keys on today’s \nkeyboards, despite the evidence that it is not the most efficient ar-\nrangement. Tradition and custom coupled with the large number \nof people already used to an existing scheme makes change diffi-\ncult or even impossible. This is the legacy problem once again: the \nheavy momentum of legacy inhibits change.\n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 275\nDeveloping the first successful typewriter was a lot more than \nsimply figuring out a reliable mechanism for imprinting the let-\nters upon the paper, although that was a difficult task by itself. \nOne question was the user interface: how should the letters be pre-\nsented to the typist? In other words, the design of the keyboard.\nConsider the typewriter keyboard, with its arbitrary, diagonally \nsloping arrangement of keys and its even more arbitrary arrange-\nment of their letters. Christopher Latham Sholes designed the cur-\nrent standard keyboard in the 1870s. His typewriter design, with \nits weirdly organized keyboard, eventually became the Remington \ntypewriter, the first successful typewriter: its keyboard layout was \nsoon adopted by everyone.\nThe design of the keyboard has a long and peculiar history. Early \ntypewriters experimented with a wide variety of layouts, using \nthree basic themes. One was circular, with the letters laid out al-\nphabetically; the operator would find the proper spot and depress \na lever, lift a rod, or do whatever other mechanical operation the \ndevice required. Another popular layout was similar to a piano \nkeyboard, with the letters laid out in a long row; some of the early \nkeyboards, including an early version by Sholes, even had black \nand white keys. Both the circular layout and the piano keyboard \nproved awkward. In the end, the typewriter keyboards all ended \nup using multiple rows of keys in a rectangular configuration, with \ndifferent companies using different arrangements of the letters. \nThe levers manipulated by the keys were large and ungainly, and the \nsize, spacing, and arrangement of the keys were dictated by these \nmechanical considerations, not by the characteristics of the human \nhand. Hence the keyboard sloped and the keys were laid out in \na diagonal pattern to provide room for the mechanical linkages. \nEven though we no longer use mechanical linkages, the keyboard \ndesign is unchanged, even for the most modern electronic devices.\nAlphabetical ordering of keys seems logical and sensible: Why \ndid it change? The reason is rooted in the early technology of key-\nboards. Early typewriters had long levers attached to the keys. \nThe levers moved individual typebars to contact the typing paper, \n\n\n276 The Design of Everyday Things\nusually from behind (the letters being typed could not be seen \nfrom the front of the typewriter). These long type arms would of-\nten collide and lock together, requiring the typist to separate them \nmanually. To avoid the jamming, Sholes arranged the keys and the \ntypebars so that letters that were frequently typed in sequence did \nnot come from adjacent typebars. After a few iterations and ex-\nperiments, a standard emerged, one that today governs keyboards \nused throughout the world, although with regional variations. The \ntop row of the American keyboard has the keys Q W E R T Y U I O P, \nwhich gives rise to the name of this layout: QWERTY. The world \nhas adopted the basic layout, although in Europe, for example, one \ncan find QZERTY, AZERTY, and QWERTZ. Different languages \nuse different alphabets, so obviously a number of keyboards had \nto move keys around to make room for additional characters.\nNote that popular legend has it that the keys were placed so as \nto slow down the typing. This is wrong: the goal was to have the \nmechanical typebars approach one another at large angles, thus \nminimizing the chance of collision. In fact, we now know that the \nFIGURE 7.4. The 1872 Sholes Typewriter. Remington, the manufacturer of the \nfirst successful typewriter, also made sewing machines. Figure A shows the in-\nfluence of the sewing machine upon the design with the use of a foot pedal for \nwhat eventually became the “return” key. A heavy weight hung from the frame \nadvanced the carriage after each letter was struck, or when the large, rectangular \nplate under the typist’s left hand was depressed (this is the “space bar”). Pressing \nthe foot pedal raised the weight. Figure B shows a blowup of the keyboard. Note \nthat the second row shows a period (.) instead of R.

By plac-\ning letters that form frequent pairs relatively far apart, typing is \nspeeded because it tends to make letter pairs be typed with differ-\nent hands .\nThere is an unconfirmed story that a salesperson rearranged \nthe keyboard to make it possible to type the word typewriter on \nthe second row, a change that violated the design principle of sep-\narating letters that were typed sequentially. Figure 7.4B shows that \nthe early Sholes keyboard was not QWERTY: the second row of \nkeys had a period (.) where today we have R, and the P and R keys \nwere on the bottom row (as well as other differences). Moving the \nR and P from the fourth row to the second makes it possible to type \nthe word typewriter using only keys on the second row.\nThere is no way to confirm the validity of the story. Moreover, \nI have only heard it describe the interchange of the period and R \nkeys, with no discussion of the P key. For the moment, suppose \nthe story were true: I can imagine the engineering minds being \noutraged. This sounds like the traditional clash between the hard-\nheaded, logical engineers and the noncomprehending sales and \nmarketing force. Was the salesperson wrong? (Note that today we \nwould call this a marketing decision, but the profession of mar-\nketing didn’t exist yet.) Well, before taking sides, realize that until \nthen, every typewriter company had failed. Remington was going \nto come out with a typewriter with a weird arrangement of the \nkeys. The sales staff were right to be worried. They were right to \ntry anything that might enhance the sales efforts. And indeed, they \nsucceeded: Remington became the leader in typewriters. Actually, \nits first model did not succeed. It took quite a while for the public \nto accept the typewriter.\nWas the keyboard really changed to allow the word typewriter \nto be typed on one row? I cannot find any solid evidence. But it is \nclear that the positions of R and P were moved to the second row: \ncompare Figure 7.4B with today’s keyboard.\nThe keyboard was designed through an evolutionary process, \nbut the main driving forces were mechanical and marketing. Even \nthough jamming isn’t a possibility with electronic keyboards and \n\n\n278 The Design of Everyday Things\ncomputers and the style of typing has changed, we are committed \nto this keyboard, stuck with it forever. But don’t despair: it really \nis a good arrangement. One legitimate area of concern is the high \nincidence of a kind of injury that befalls typists: carpal tunnel syn-\ndrome. This ailment is a result of frequent and prolonged repetitive \nmotions of the hand and wrist, so it is common among typists, \nmusicians, and people who do a lot of handwriting, sewing, some \nsports, and assembly line work. Gestural keyboards, such as the \none shown in Figure 7.2D, might reduce the incidence. The US Na-\ntional Institute of Health advises, “Ergonomic aids, such as split \nkeyboards, keyboard trays, typing pads, and wrist braces, may be \nused to improve wrist posture during typing. Take frequent breaks \nwhen typing and always stop if there is tingling or pain.”\nAugust Dvorak, an educational psychologist, painstakingly \ndeveloped a better keyboard in the 1930s. The Dvorak keyboard \nlayout is indeed superior to that of QWERTY, but not to the extent \nclaimed. Studies in my laboratory showed that the typing speed on \na QWERTY was only slightly slower than on a Dvorak, not differ-\nent enough to make upsetting the legacy worthwhile. Millions of \npeople would have to learn a new style of typing. Millions of type-\nwriters would have to be changed. Once a standard is in place, the \nvested interests of existing practices impede change, even where \nthe change would be an improvement. Moreover, in the case of \nQWERTY versus Dvorak, the gain is simply not worth the pain. \n“Good enough” triumphs again.\nWhat about keyboards in alphabetical order? Now that we \nno longer have mechanical constraints on keyboard ordering, \nwouldn’t they at least be easier to learn? Nope. Because the letters \nhave to be laid out in several rows, just knowing the alphabet isn’t \nenough. You also have to know where the rows break, and today, \nevery alphabetic keyboard breaks the rows at different points. One \ngreat advantage of QWERTY—that frequent letter pairs are typed \nwith opposite hands—would no longer be true. In other words, \nforget it. In my studies, QWERTY and Dvorak typing speeds were \nconsiderably faster than those on alphabetic keyboards. And an \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 279\nalphabetical arrangement of the keys was no faster than a random \narrangement.\nCould we do better if we could depress more than one finger at \na time? Yes, court stenographers can out-type anyone else. They \nuse chord keyboards, typing syllables, not individual letters, di-\nrectly onto the page—each syllable represented by the simultane-\nous pressing of keys, each combination being called a “chord.” The \nmost common keyboard for American law court recorders requires \nbetween two and six keys to be pressed simultaneously to code the \ndigits, punctuation, and phonetic sounds of English.\nAlthough chord keyboards can be very fast—more than three \nhundred words per minute is common—the chords are difficult \nto learn and to retain; all the knowledge has to be in the head. \nWalk up to any regular keyboard and you can use it right away. \nJust search for the letter you want and push that key. With a chord \nkeyboard, you have to press several keys simultaneously. There is \nno way to label the keys properly and no way to know what to do \njust by looking. The casual typist is out of luck.\nTwo Forms of Innovation: \nIncremental and Radical\nThere are two major forms of product innovation: one follows a \nnatural, slow evolutionary process; the other is achieved through \nradical new development. In general, people tend to think of inno-\nvation as being radical, major changes, whereas the most common \nand powerful form of it is actually small and incremental.\nAlthough each step of incremental evolution is modest, con-\ntinual slow, steady improvements can result in rather significant \nchanges over time. Consider the automobile. Steam-driven vehicles \n(the first automobiles) were developed in the late 1700s. The first \ncommercial automobile was built in 1888 by the German Karl Benz \n(his company, Benz & Cie, later merged with Daimler and today is \nknown as Mercedes-Benz).\nBenz’s automobile was a radical innovation. And although his firm \nsurvived, most of its rivals did not. The first American automobile \n\n\n280 The Design of Everyday Things\ncompany was Duryea, which only lasted a few years: being first \ndoes not guarantee success. Although the automobile itself was a \nradical innovation, since its introduction it has advanced through \ncontinual slow, steady improvement, year after year: over a century \nof incremental innovation (with a few radical changes in compo-\nnents). Because of the century of incremental enhancement, today’s \nautomobiles are much quieter, faster, more efficient, more comfort-\nable, safer, and less expensive (adjusted for inflation) than those \nearly vehicles.\nRadical innovation changes paradigms. The typewriter was \na radical innovation that had dramatic impact upon office and \nhome writing. It helped provide a role for women in offices as \ntypists and secretaries, which led to the redefinition of the job of \nsecretary to be a dead end rather than the first step toward an \nexecutive position. Similarly, the automobile transformed home \nlife, allowing people to live at a distance from their work and rad-\nically impacting the world of business. It also turned out to be a \nmassive source of air pollution (although it did eliminate horse \nmanure from city streets). It is a major cause of accidental death, \nwith a worldwide fatality rate of over one million each year. The \nintroduction of electric lighting, the airplane, radio, television, \nhome computer, and social networks all had massive social im-\npacts. Mobile phones changed the phone industry, and the use of \nthe technical communication system called packet switching led \nto the Internet. These are radical innovations. Radical innovation \nchanges lives and industries. Incremental innovation makes things \nbetter. We need both.\nINCREMENTAL INNOVATION\nMost design evolves through incremental innovation by means of \ncontinual testing and refinement. In the ideal case, the design is \ntested, problem areas are discovered and modified, and then the \nproduct is continually retested and remodified. If a change makes \nmatters worse, well, it just gets changed again on the next go-\nround. Eventually the bad features are modified into good ones, \nwhile the good ones are kept. The technical term for this process is \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business \n281\nhill climbing, analogous to climbing a hill blindfolded. Move your \nfoot in one direction. If it is downhill, try another direction. If the \ndirection is uphill, take one step. Keep doing this until you have \nreached a point where all steps would be downhill; then you are at \nthe top of the hill, or at least at a local peak.\nHill climbing. This method is the secret to incremental innova-\ntion. This is at the heart of the human-centered design process dis-\ncussed in Chapter 6. Does hill climbing always work? Although it \nguarantees that the design will reach the top of the hill, what if the \ndesign is not on the best possible hill? Hill climbing cannot find \nhigher hills: it can only find the peak of the hill it started from. \nWant to try a different hill? Try radical innovation, although that is \nas likely to find a worse hill as a better one.\nRADICAL INNOVATION\nIncremental innovation starts with existing products and makes \nthem better. Radical innovation starts fresh, often driven by new \ntechnologies that make possible new capabilities. Thus, the inven-\ntion of vacuum tubes was a radical innovation, paving the way \nfor rapid advances in radio and television. Similarly, the inven-\ntion of the transistor allowed dramatic advances in electronic de-\nvices, computational power, increased reliability, and lower costs. \nThe development of GPS satellites unleashed a torrent of location-\nbased services.\nA second factor is the reconsideration of the meaning of tech-\nnology. Modern data networks serve as an example. Newspapers, \nmagazines, and books were once thought of as part of the pub-\nlishing industry, very different from radio and television broad-\ncasting. All of these were different from movies and music. But \nonce the Internet took hold, along with enhanced and inexpensive \ncomputer power and displays, it became clear that all of these dis-\nparate industries were really just different forms of information \nproviders, so that all could be conveyed to customers by a single \nmedium. This redefinition collapses together the publishing, tele-\nphone, television and cable broadcasting, and music industries. We \nstill have books, newspapers, and magazines, television shows and \n\n\n282 The Design of Everyday Things\nmovies, musicians and music, but the way by which they are dis-\ntributed has changed, thereby requiring massive restructuring of \ntheir corresponding industries. Electronic games, another radical \ninnovation, are combining with film and video on the one hand, \nand books on the other, to form new types of interactive engage-\nment. The collapsing of industries is still taking place, and what \nwill replace them is not yet clear.\nRadical innovation is what many people seek, for it is the big, \nspectacular form of change. But most radical ideas fail, and even \nthose that succeed can take decades and, as this chapter has al-\nready illustrated, they may take centuries to succeed. Incremental \nproduct innovation is difficult, but these difficulties pale to insig-\nnificance compared to the challenges faced by radical innovation. \nIncremental innovations occur by the millions each year; radical \ninnovation is far less frequent.\nWhat industries are ready for radical innovation? Try education, \ntransportation, medicine, and housing, all of which are overdue for \nmajor transformation.\nThe Design of Everyday Things: \n1988–2038\nTechnology changes rapidly, people and culture change slowly. \nOr as the French put it:\nPlus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.\nThe more things change, the more they are the same.\nEvolutionary change to people is always taking place, but the \npace of human evolutionary change is measured in thousands of \nyears. Human cultures change somewhat more rapidly over peri-\nods measured in decades or centuries. Microcultures, such as the \nway by which teenagers differ from adults, can change in a gener-\nation. What this means is that although technology is continually \nintroducing new means of doing things, people are resistant to \nchanges in the way they do things.\n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 283\nConsider three simple examples: social interaction, communica-\ntion, and music. These represent three different human activities, \nbut each is so fundamental to human life that all three have per-\nsisted throughout recorded history and will persist, despite major \nchanges in the technologies that support these activities. They are \nakin to eating: new technologies will change the types of food we \neat and the way it is prepared, but will never eliminate the need \nto eat. People often ask me to predict “the next great change.” My \nanswer is to tell them to examine some fundamentals, such as so-\ncial interaction, communication, sports and play, music and enter-\ntainment. The changes will take place within spheres of activity \nsuch as these. Are these the only fundamentals? Of course not: add \neducation (and learning), business (and commerce), transporta-\ntion, self-expression, the arts, and of course, sex. And don’t forget \nimportant sustaining activities, such as the need for good health, \nfood and drink, clothing, and housing. Fundamental needs will also \nstay the same, even if they get satisfied in radically different ways.\nThe Design of Everyday Things was first published in 1988 (when it \nwas called The Psychology of Everyday Things). Since the original pub-\nlication, technology has changed so much that even though the prin-\nciples remained constant, many of the examples from 1988 are no \nlonger relevant. The technology of interaction has changed. Oh yes, \ndoors and switches, faucets and taps still provide the same difficul-\nties they did back then, but now we have new sources of difficulties \nand confusion. The same principles that worked before still apply, \nbut this time they must also be applied to intelligent machines, to the \ncontinuous interaction with large data sources, to social networks \nand to communication systems and products that enable lifelong \ninteraction with friends and acquaintances across the world.\nWe gesture and dance to interact with our devices, and in turn \nthey interact with us via sound and touch, and through multiple \ndisplays of all sizes—some that we wear; some on the floor, walls, \nor ceilings; and some projected directly into our eyes. We speak to \nour devices and they speak back. And as they get more and more \nintelligent, they take over many of the activities we thought that \n\n\n284 The Design of Everyday Things\nonly people could do. Artificial intelligence pervades our lives and \ndevices, from our thermostats to our automobiles. Technologies are \nalways undergoing change.\nAS TECHNOLOGIES CHANGE \nWILL PEOPLE STAY THE SAME?\nAs we develop new forms of interaction and communication, \nwhat new principles are required? What happens when we wear \naugmented reality glasses or embed more and more technology \nwithin our bodies? Gestures and body movements are fun, but \nnot very precise.\nFor many millennia, even though technology has undergone \nradical change, people have remained the same. Will this hold true \nin the future? What happens as we add more and more enhance-\nments inside the human body? People with prosthetic limbs will \nbe faster, stronger, and better runners or sports players than nor-\nmal players. Implanted hearing devices and artificial lenses and \ncorneas are already in use. Implanted memory and communica-\ntion devices will mean that some people will have permanently \nenhanced reality, never lacking for information. Implanted com-\nputational devices could enhance thinking, problem-solving, and \ndecision-making. People might become cyborgs: part biology, \npart artificial technology. In turn, machines will become more like \npeople, with neural-like computational abilities and humanlike \nbehavior. Moreover, new developments in biology might add to \nthe list of artificial supplements, with genetic modification of peo-\nple and biological processors and devices for machines. \nAll of these changes raise considerable ethical issues. The long-\nheld view that even as technology changes, people remain the same \nmay no longer hold. Moreover, a new species is arising, artificial \ndevices that have many of the capabilities of animals and people, \nsometimes superior abilities. (That machines might be better than \npeople at some things has long been true: they are clearly stron-\nger and faster. Even the simple desk calculator can do arithmetic \nbetter than we can, which is why we use them. Many computer \nprograms can do advanced mathematics better than we can, which \n",

This also means that cultures are changing.\nThere is no question that human culture has been vastly impacted \nby the advent of technology. Our lives, our family size and living \narrangements, and the role played by business and education in \nour lives are all governed by the technologies of the era. Modern \ncommunication technology changes the nature of joint work. As \nsome people get advanced cognitive skills due to implants, while \nsome machines gain enhanced human-qualities through advanced \ntechnologies, artificial intelligence, and perhaps bionic technolo-\ngies, we can expect even more changes. Technology, people, and \ncultures: all will change.\nTHINGS THAT MAKE US SMART\nCouple the use of full-body motion and gestures with high-quality \nauditory and visual displays that can be superimposed over the \nsounds and sights of the world to amplify them, to explain and \nannotate them, and we give to people power that exceeds anything \never known before. What do the limits of human memory mean \nwhen a machine can remind us of all that has happened before, at \nprecisely the exact time the information is needed? One argument \nis that technology makes us smart: we remember far more than \never before and our cognitive abilities are much enhanced. \nAnother argument is that technology makes us stupid. Sure, we \nlook smart with the technology, but take it away and we are worse \noff than before it existed. We have become dependent upon our \ntechnologies to navigate the world, to hold intelligent conversa-\ntion, to write intelligently, and to remember.\nOnce technology can do our arithmetic, can remember for us, \nand can tell us how to behave, then we have no need to learn \nthese things. But the instant the technology goes away, we are \nleft helpless, unable to do any basic functions. We are now so \ndependent upon technology that when we are deprived, we suf-\nfer. We are unable to make our own clothes from plants and an-\nimal skins, unable to grow and harvest crops or catch animals. \nWithout technology, we would starve or freeze to death. Without \n\n\n286 The Design of Everyday Things\ncognitive technologies, will we fall into an equivalent state of \nignorance?\nThese fears have long been with us. In ancient Greece, Plato tells \nus that Socrates complained about the impact of books, arguing \nthat reliance on written material would diminish not only memory \nbut the very need to think, to debate, to learn through discussion. \nAfter all, said Socrates, when a person tells you something, you \ncan question the statement, discuss and debate it, thereby enhanc-\ning the material and the understanding. With a book, well, what \ncan you do? You can’t argue back.\nBut over the years, the human brain has remained much the \nsame. Human intelligence has certainly not diminished. True, \nwe no longer learn how to memorize vast amounts of material. \nWe no longer need to be completely proficient at arithmetic, for \ncalculators—present as dedicated devices or on almost every \ncomputer or phone—take care of that task for us. But does that \nmake us stupid? Does the fact that I can no longer remember my \nown phone number indicate my growing feebleness? No, on the \ncontrary, it unleashes the mind from the petty tyranny of tending \nto the trivial and allows it to concentrate on the important and \nthe critical.\nReliance on technology is a benefit to humanity. With technol-\nogy, the brain gets neither better nor worse. Instead, it is the task \nthat changes. Human plus machine is more powerful than either \nhuman or machine alone.\nThe best chess-playing machine can beat the best human chess \nplayer. But guess what, the combination of human plus machine \ncan beat the best human and the best machine. Moreover, this win-\nning combination need not have the best human or machine. As \nMIT professor Erik Brynjolfsson explained at a meeting of the Na-\ntional Academy of Engineering:\nThe best chess player in the world today is not a computer or a human \nbut a team of humans and computers working together. In freestyle \nchess competitions, where teams of humans and computers compete, \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 287\nthe winners tend not to be the teams with the most powerful computers \nor the best chess players. The winning teams are able to leverage the \nunique skills of humans and computers to work together. That is a met-\naphor for what we can do going forward: have people and technology \nwork together in new ways to create value. (Brynjolfsson, 2012.)\nWhy is this? Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee quote the \nworld-champion human chess player Gary Kasparov, explaining \nwhy “the overall winner in a recent freestyle tournament had nei-\nther the best human players nor the most powerful computers.” \nKasparov described a team consisting of:\na pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the \nsame time. Their skill at manipulating and “coaching” their computers \nto look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior \nchess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater \ncomputational power of other participants.Weak human + machine + \nbetter process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more re-\nmarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process. \n(Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2011.)\nMoreover, Brynjolfsson and McAfee argue that the same pattern is \nfound in many activities, including both business and science: “The \nkey to winning the race is not to compete against machines but to com-\npete with machines. Fortunately, humans are strongest exactly where \ncomputers are weak, creating a potentially beautiful partnership.”\nThe cognitive scientist (and anthropologist) Edwin Hutchins of \nthe University of California, San Diego, has championed the power \nof distributed cognition, whereby some components are done by \npeople (who may be distributed across time and space); other com-\nponents, by our technologies. It was he who taught me how pow-\nerful this combination makes us. This provides the answer to the \nquestion: Does the new technology make us stupid? No, on the \ncontrary, it changes the tasks we do. Just as the best chess player \nis a combination of human and technology, we, in combination \n\n\n288 The Design of Everyday Things\nwith technology, are smarter than ever before. As I put it in my \nbook Things That Make Us Smart, the power of the unaided mind is \nhighly overrated. It is things that make us smart.\nThe power of the unaided mind is highly overrated. Without external \naids, deep, sustained reasoning is difficult. Unaided memory, thought, \nand reasoning are all limited in power. Human intelligence is highly \nflexible and adaptive, superb at inventing procedures and objects that \novercome its own limits. The real powers come from devising external \naids that enhance cognitive abilities. How have we increased memory, \nthought and reasoning? By the invention of external aids: it is things \nthat make us smart. Some assistance comes through cooperative, social \nbehavior: some arises through exploitation of the information pres-\nent in the environment; and some comes through the development of \ntools of thought—cognitive artifacts—that complement abilities and \nstrengthen mental powers. (The opening paragraph of Chapter 3, Things \nThat Make Us Smart, 1993.)\nThe Future of Books\nIt is one thing to have tools that aid in writing conventional books, \nbut quite another when we have tools that dramatically transform \nthe book.\nWhy should a book comprise words and some illustrations \nmeant to be read linearly from front to back? Why shouldn’t it be \ncomposed of small sections, readable in whatever order is desired? \nWhy shouldn’t it be dynamic, with video and audio segments, \nperhaps changing according to who is reading it, including notes \nmade by other readers or viewers, or incorporating the author’s \nlatest thoughts, perhaps changing even as it is being read, where \nthe word text could mean anything: voice, video, images, dia-\ngrams, and words?\nSome authors, especially of fiction, might still prefer the linear \ntelling of tales, for authors are storytellers, and in stories, the or-\nder in which characters and events are introduced is important to \nbuild the suspense, keep the reader enthralled, and manage the \nemotional highs and lows that characterize great storytelling. But \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 289\nfor nonfiction, for books like this one, order is not as important. \nThis book does not attempt to manipulate your emotions, to keep \nyou in suspense, or to have dramatic peaks. You should be able to \nexperience it in the order you prefer, reading items out of sequence \nand skipping whatever is not relevant to your needs.\nSuppose this book were interactive? If you have trouble under-\nstanding something, suppose you could click on the page and I \nwould pop up and explain something. I tried that many years ago \nwith three of my books, all combined into one interactive electronic \nbook. But the attempt fell prey to the demons of product design: \ngood ideas that appear too early will fail.\nIt took a lot of effort to produce that book. I worked with a large \nteam of people from Voyager Books, flying to Santa Monica, Cal-\nifornia, for roughly a year of visits to film the excerpts and record \nmy part. Robert Stein, the head of Voyager, assembled a talented \nteam of editors, producers, videographers, interactive designers, \nand illustrators. Alas, the result was produced in a computer sys-\ntem called HyperCard, a clever tool developed by Apple but never \nreally given full support. Eventually, Apple stopped supporting it \nand today, even though I still have copies of the original disks, they \nwill not run on any existing machine. (And even if they could, the \nvideo resolution is very poor by today’s standards.)\nFIGURE 7.5. The Voyager Interactive Electronic Book. Figure A, on the left, is \nme stepping on to a page of The Design of Everyday Things. Figure B, on the right, \nshows me explaining a point about graph design in my book Things That Make \nUs Smart.\nB.\nA.\n\n\n290 The Design of Everyday Things\nNotice the phrase “it took a lot of effort to produce that book.” \nI don’t even remember how many people were involved, but the \ncredits include the following: editor-producer, art director–graphic \ndesigner, programmer, interface designers (four people, including \nme), the production team (twenty-seven people), and then special \nthanks to seventeen people.\nYes, today anybody can record a voice or video essay. Anyone \ncan shoot a video and do simple editing. But to produce a pro-\nfessional-level multimedia book of roughly three hundred pages \nor two hours of video (or some combination) that will be read \nand enjoyed by people across the world requires an immense \namount of talent and a variety of skills. Amateurs can do a five- \nor ten-minute video, but anything beyond that requires superb \nediting skills. Moreover, there has to be a writer, a cameraperson, \na recording person, and a lighting person. There has to be a direc-\ntor to coordinate these activities and to select the best approach to \neach scene (chapter). A skilled editor is required to piece the seg-\nments together. An electronic book on the environment, Al Gore’s \ninteractive media book Our Choice (2011), lists a large number of \njob titles for the people responsible for this one book: publishers \n(two people), editor, production director, production editor, and \nproduction supervisor, software architect, user interface engineer, \nengineer, interactive graphics, animations, graphics design, photo \neditor, video editors (two), videographer, music, and cover de-\nsigner. What is the future of the book? Very expensive.\nThe advent of new technologies is making books, interactive \nmedia, and all sorts of educational and recreational material more \neffective and pleasurable. Each of the many tools makes creation \neasier. As a result, we will see a proliferation of materials. Most will \nbe amateurish, incomplete, and somewhat incoherent. But even \namateur productions can serve valuable functions in our lives, as \nthe immense proliferation of homemade videos available on the \nInternet demonstrate, teaching us everything from how to cook \nKorean pajeon, repair a faucet, or understand Maxwell’s equations \nof electromagnetic waves. But for high-quality professional mate-\nrial that tells a coherent story in a way that is reliable, where the \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 291\nfacts have been checked and the message authoritative, where the \nmaterial will flow, experts are needed. The mix of technologies \nand tools makes quick and rough creation easier, but polished and \nprofessional level material much more difficult. The society of the \nfuture: something to look forward to with pleasure, contemplation, \nand dread.\nThe Moral Obligations of Design\nThat design affects society is hardly news to designers. Many take \nthe implications of their work seriously. But the conscious manip-\nulation of society has severe drawbacks, not the least of which is \nthe fact that not everyone agrees on the appropriate goals. Design, \ntherefore, takes on political significance; indeed, design philoso-\nphies vary in important ways across political systems. In Western \ncultures, design has reflected the capitalistic importance of the mar-\nketplace, with an emphasis on exterior features deemed to be at-\ntractive to the purchaser. In the consumer economy, taste is not the \ncriterion in the marketing of expensive foods or drinks, usability is \nnot the primary criterion in the marketing of home and office appli-\nances. We are surrounded with objects of desire, not objects of use.\nNEEDLESS FEATURES, NEEDLESS MODELS: \nGOOD FOR BUSINESS, BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT\nIn the world of consumable products, such as food and news, there \nis always a need for more food and news. When the product is con-\nsumed, then the customers are consumers. A never-ending cycle. In \nthe world of services, the same applies. Someone has to cook and \nserve the food in a restaurant, take care of us when we are sick, do \nthe daily transactions we all need. Services can be self-sustaining \nbecause the need is always there.\nBut a business that makes and sells durable goods faces a prob-\nlem: As soon as everyone who wants the product has it, then there \nis no need for more. Sales will cease. The company will go out of \nbusiness.\nIn the 1920s, manufacturers deliberately planned ways of making \ntheir products become obsolete (although the practice had existed \n\n\n292 The Design of Everyday Things\nlong before then). Products were built with a limited life span. Au-\ntomobiles were designed to fall apart. A story tells of Henry Ford’s \nbuying scrapped Ford cars and having his engineers disassemble \nthem to see which parts failed and which were still in good shape. \nEngineers assumed this was done to find the weak parts and make \nthem stronger. Nope. Ford explained that he wanted to find the \nparts that were still in good shape. The company could save money \nif they redesigned these parts to fail at the same time as the others.\nMaking things fail is not the only way to sustain sales. The wom-\nen’s clothing industry is an example: what is fashionable this year is \nnot next year, so women are encouraged to replace their wardrobe \nevery season, every year. The same philosophy was soon extended \nto the automobile industry, where dramatic style changes on a reg-\nular basis made it obvious which people were up to date; which \npeople were laggards, driving old-fashioned vehicles. The same is \ntrue for our smart screens, cameras, and TV sets. Even the kitchen \nand laundry, where appliances used to last for decades, have seen \nthe impact of fashion. Now, out-of-date features, out-of-date styling, \nand even out-of-date colors entice homeowners to change. There \nare some gender differences. Men are not as sensitive as women to \nfashion in clothes, but they more than make up for the difference \nby their interest in the latest fashions in automobiles and other \ntechnologies.\nBut why purchase a new computer when the old one is func-\ntioning perfectly well? Why buy a new cooktop or refrigerator, a \nnew phone or camera? Do we really need the ice cube dispenser \nin the door of the refrigerator, the display screen on the oven door, \nthe navigation system that uses three-dimensional images? What \nis the cost to the environment for all the materials and energy used \nto manufacture the new products, to say nothing of the problems \nof disposing safely of the old?\nAnother model for sustainability is the subscription model. Do \nyou have an electronic reading device, or music or video player? \nSubscribe to the service that provides articles and news, music and \nentertainment, video and movies. These are all consumables, so \n",

Of course this only works if the manufacturer of the durable \ngood is also the provider of services. If not, what alternatives are \nthere?\nAh, the model year: each year a new model can be introduced, \njust as good as the previous year’s model, only claiming to be bet-\nter. It always increases in power and features. Look at all the new \nfeatures. How did you ever exist without them? Meanwhile, sci-\nentists, engineers, and inventors are busy developing yet newer \ntechnologies. Do you like your television? What if it were in three \ndimensions? With multiple channels of surround sound? With vir-\ntual goggles so you are surrounded by the images, 360 degrees’ \nworth? Turn your head or body and see what is happening behind \nyou. When you watch sports, you can be inside the team, experi-\nencing the game the way the team does. Cars not only will drive \nthemselves to make you safer, but provide lots of entertainment \nalong the way. Video games will keep adding layers and chapters, \nnew story lines and characters, and of course, 3-D virtual envi-\nronments. Household appliances will talk to one another, telling \nremote households the secrets of our usage patterns.\nThe design of everyday things is in great danger of becoming the \ndesign of superfluous, overloaded, unnecessary things.\nDesign Thinking and \nThinking About Design\nDesign is successful only if the final product is successful—if peo-\nple buy it, use it, and enjoy it, thus spreading the word. A design \nthat people do not purchase is a failed design, no matter how great \nthe design team might consider it.\nDesigners need to make things that satisfy people’s needs, in \nterms of function, in terms of being understandable and usable, \nand in terms of their ability to deliver emotional satisfaction, pride, \nand delight. In other words, the design must be thought of as a \ntotal experience.\n\n\n294 The Design of Everyday Things\nBut successful products need more than a great design. They \nhave to be able to be produced reliably, efficiently, and on sched-\nule. If the design complicates the engineering requirements so \nmuch that they cannot be realized within the cost and scheduling \nconstraints, then the design is flawed. Similarly, if manufacturing \ncannot produce the product, then the design is flawed.\nMarketing considerations are important. Designers want to sat-\nisfy people’s needs. Marketing wants to ensure that people ac-\ntually buy and use the product. These are two different sets of \nrequirements: design must satisfy both. It doesn’t matter how \ngreat the design is if people don’t buy it. And it doesn’t matter \nhow many people buy something if they are going to dislike it \nwhen they start using it. Designers will be more effective as they \nlearn more about sales and marketing, and the financial parts of \nthe business.\nFinally, products have a complex life cycle. Many people will \nneed assistance in using a device, either because the design or the \nmanual is not clear, or because they are doing something novel that \nwas not considered in the product development, or for numerous \nother reasons. If the service provided to these people is inadequate, \nthe product will suffer. Similarly if the device must be maintained, \nrepaired, or upgraded, how this is managed affects people’s appre-\nciation of the product.\nIn today’s environmentally sensitive world, the full life cycle of \nthe product must be taken into consideration. What are the envi-\nronmental costs of the materials, of the manufacturing process, of \ndistribution, servicing, and repairs? When it is time to replace the \nunit, what is the environmental impact of recycling or otherwise \nreusing the old?\nThe product development process is complex and difficult. But \nto me, that is why it can be so rewarding. Great products pass \nthrough a gauntlet of challenges. To satisfy the myriad needs re-\nquires skill as well as patience. It requires a combination of high \ntechnical skills, great business skills, and a large amount of per-\nsonal social skills for interacting with the many other groups that \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 295\nare involved, all of whom have their own agendas, all of which \nbelieve their requirements to be critical.\nDesign consists of a series of wonderful, exciting challenges, \nwith each challenge being an opportunity. Like all great drama, \nit has its emotional highs and lows, peaks and valleys. The great \nproducts overcome the lows and end up high.\nNow you are on your own. If you are a designer, help fight the \nbattle for usability. If you are a user, then join your voice with those \nwho cry for usable products. Write to manufacturers. Boycott un-\nusable designs. Support good designs by purchasing them, even \nif it means going out of your way, even if it means spending a bit \nmore. And voice your concerns to the stores that carry the prod-\nucts; manufacturers listen to their customers.\nWhen you visit museums of science and technology, ask ques-\ntions if you have trouble understanding. Provide feedback about \nthe exhibits and whether they work well or poorly. Encourage mu-\nseums to move toward better usability and understandability.\nAnd enjoy yourself. Walk around the world examining the de-\ntails of design. Learn how to observe. Take pride in the little things \nthat help: think kindly of the person who so thoughtfully put them \nin. Realize that even details matter, that the designer may have \nhad to fight to include something helpful. If you have difficulties, \nremember, it’s not your fault: it’s bad design. Give prizes to those \nwho practice good design: send flowers. Jeer those who don’t: \nsend weeds.\nTechnology continually changes. Much is for the good. Much \nis not. All technology can be used in ways never intended by the \ninventors. One exciting development is what I call “the rise of \nthe small.”\nTHE RISE OF THE SMALL\nI dream of the power of individuals, whether alone or in small \ngroups, to unleash their creative spirits, their imagination, and \ntheir talents to develop a wide range of innovation. New tech-\nnologies promise to make this possible. Now, for the first time \n\n\n296 The Design of Everyday Things\nin history, individuals can share their ideas, their thoughts and \ndreams. They can produce their own products, their own ser-\nvices, and make these available to anyone in the world. All can \nbe their own master, exercising whatever special talents and in-\nterests they may have.\nWhat drives this dream? The rise of small, efficient tools that \nempower individuals. The list is large and growing continuously. \nConsider the rise of musical explorations through conventional, elec-\ntronic, and virtual instruments. Consider the rise of self-publishing, \nbypassing conventional publishers, printers and distributors, and \nreplacing these with inexpensive electronic editions available to \nanyone in the world to download to e-book readers.\nWitness the rise of billions of small videos, available to all. Some \nare simply self-serving, some are incredibly educational, and some \nare humorous, some serious. They cover everything from how to \nmake spätzle to how to understand mathematics, or simply how \nto dance or play a musical instrument. Some films are purely for \nentertainment. Universities are getting into the act, sharing whole \ncurricula, including videos of lectures. College students post their \nclass assignments as videos and text, allowing the whole world to \nbenefit from their efforts. Consider the same phenomenon in writ-\ning, reporting events, and the creation of music and art.\nAdd to these capabilities the ready availability of inexpensive \nmotors, sensors, computation, and communication. Now consider \nthe potential when 3-D printers increase in performance while \ndecreasing in price, allowing individuals to manufacture custom \nitems whenever they are required. Designers all over the world \nwill publish their ideas and plans, enabling entire new industries \nof custom mass production. Small quantities can be made as inex-\npensively as large, and individuals might design their own items \nor rely on an ever-increasing number of freelance designers who \nwill publish plans that can then be customized and printed at local \n3-D print shops or within their own homes.\nConsider the rise of specialists to help plan meals and cook them, \nto modify designs to fit needs and circumstances, to tutor on a \n\n\n \nseven: Design in the World of Business 297\nwide variety of topics. Experts share their knowledge on blogs and \non Wikipedia, all out of altruism, being rewarded by the thanks of \ntheir readers.\nI dream of a renaissance of talent, where people are empowered \nto create, to use their skills and talents. Some may wish for the \nsafety and security of working for organizations. Some may wish \nto start new enterprises. Some may do this as hobbies. Some may \nband together into small groups and cooperatives, the better to as-\nsemble the variety of skills required by modern technology, to help \nshare their knowledge, to teach one another, and to assemble the \ncritical mass that will always be needed, even for small projects. \nSome may hire themselves out to provide the necessary skills re-\nquired of large projects, while still keeping their own freedom and \nauthority.\nIn the past, innovation happened in the industrialized nations \nand with time, each innovation became more powerful, more com-\nplex, often bloated with features. Older technology was given to \nthe developing nations. The cost to the environment was seldom \nconsidered. But with the rise of the small, with new, flexible, inex-\npensive technologies, the power is shifting. Today, anyone in the \nworld can create, design, and manufacture. The newly developed \nnations are taking advantage, designing and building by them-\nselves, for themselves. Moreover, out of necessity they develop \nadvanced devices that require less power, that are simpler to make, \nmaintain, and use. They develop medical procedures that don’t re-\nquire refrigeration or continual access to electric power. Instead of \nusing handed-down technology, their results add value for all of \nus—call it handed-up technology.\nWith the rise of global interconnection, global communication, \npowerful design, and manufacturing methods that can be used \nby all, the world is rapidly changing. Design is a powerful equal-\nizing tool: all that is needed is observation, creativity, and hard \nwork—anyone can do it. With open-source software, inexpensive \nopen-source 3-D printers, and even open-source education, we can \ntransform the world.\n\n\n298 The Design of Everyday Things\nAS THE WORLD CHANGES, \nWHAT STAYS THE SAME?\nWith massive change, a number of fundamental principles stay \nthe same. Human beings have always been social beings. Social \ninteraction and the ability to keep in touch with people across the \nworld, across time, will stay with us. The design principles of this \nbook will not change, for the principles of discoverability, of feed-\nback, and of the power of affordances and signifiers, mapping, and \nconceptual models will always hold. Even fully autonomous, auto-\nmatic machines will follow these principles for their interactions. \nOur technologies may change, but the fundamental principles of \ninteraction are permanent.\n\n\n \n \n299\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe original edition of this book was entitled The Psychology of Ev-\neryday Things (POET). This title is a good example of the difference \nbetween academics and industry. POET was a clever, cute title, \nmuch loved by my academic friends. When Doubleday/Currency \napproached me about publishing the paperback version of this \nbook, the editors also said, “But of course, the title will have to be \nchanged.” Title changed? I was horrified. But I decided to follow \nmy own advice and do some research on readers. I discovered that \nwhile the academic community liked the title and its cleverness, \nthe business community did not. In fact, business often ignored the \nbook because the title sent the wrong message. Bookstores placed \nthe book in their psychology section (along with books on sex, \nlove, and self-help). The final nail in the title’s coffin came when I \nwas asked to talk to a group of senior executives of a leading man-\nufacturing company. The person who introduced me to the audi-\nence praised the book, damned the title, and asked his colleagues \nto read the book despite the title. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR POET: \nPSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS\nThe book was conceived and the first few drafts written in the late \n1980s while I was at the Applied Psychology Unit (the APU) in \n\n\n300 Acknowledgments\nCambridge, England, a laboratory of the British Medical Research \nCouncil (the laboratory no longer exists). At the APU, I met an-\nother visiting American professor, David Rubin of Duke Univer-\nsity, who was analyzing the recall of epic poetry. Rubin showed \nme that it wasn’t all in memory: much of the information was in \nthe world, or at least in the structure of the tale, the poetics, and the \nlifestyles of the people. \nAfter spending the fall and winter in Cambridge, England, at \nthe APU, I went to Austin, Texas, for the spring and summer (yes, \nthe opposite order from what would be predicted by thinking \nof the weather at these two places). In Austin, I was at the Micro-\nelectronics and Computer Consortium (MCC), where I completed \nthe manuscript. Finally, when I returned to my home base at the \nUniversity of California, San Diego (UCSD), I revised the book sev-\neral more times. I used it in classes and sent copies to a variety of \ncolleagues for suggestions. I benefited greatly from my interactions \nat all these places: APU, MCC, and, of course, UCSD. The com-\nments of my students and readers were invaluable, causing radical \nrevision from the original structure. \nMy hosts at the APU in Britain were most gracious, especially \nAlan Baddeley, Phil Barnard, Thomas Green, Phil Johnson-Laird, \nTony Marcel, Karalyn and Roy Patterson, Tim Shallice, and Richard \nYoung. Peter Cook, Jonathan Grudin, and Dave Wroblewski were \nextremely helpful during my stay at the MCC in Texas (another in-\nstitution that no longer exists). At UCSD, I especially wish to thank \nthe students in Psychology 135 and 205: my undergraduate and \ngraduate courses at UCSD entitled “Cognitive Engineering.” \nMy understanding of how we interact with the world was de-\nveloped and strengthened by years of debate and interaction with \na very powerful team of people at UCSD from the departments of \ncognitive science, psychology, anthropology, and sociology, orga-\nnized by Mike Cole, who met informally once a week for several \nyears. The primary members were Roy d’Andrade, Aaron Cicourel, \nMike Cole, Bud Mehan, George Mandler, Jean Mandler, Dave Ru-\nmelhart, and me. In later years, I benefited immensely from my \n",

Special thanks must be given to Phil Agre, Sherman De-\nForest, and Jef Raskin, all of whom read the manuscript with care \nand provided numerous and valuable suggestions. Collecting the \nillustrations became part of the fun as I traveled the world with \ncamera in hand. Eileen Conway and Michael Norman helped col-\nlect and organize the figures and illustrations. Julie Norman helped \nas she does on all my books, proofing, editing, commenting, and \nencouraging. Eric Norman provided valuable advice, support, and \nphotogenic feet and hands. \nFinally, my colleagues at the Institute for Cognitive Science at \nUCSD helped throughout—in part through the wizardry of inter-\nnational computer mail, in part through their personal assistance \nto the details of the process. I single out Bill Gaver, Mike Mozer, \nand Dave Owen for their detailed comments, but many helped out \nat one time or another during the research that preceded the book \nand the several years of writing. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR \nDESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS, REVISED EDITION\nBecause this new edition follows the organization and principles \nof the first, all the help given to me for that earlier edition applies \nto this one as well. \nI have learned a lot in the years that have passed since the first \nedition of this book. For one thing, then I was an academic scholar. \nIn the interim I have worked in several different companies. The \nmost important experience was at Apple, where I began to appre-\nciate how issues—budget, schedule, competitive forces, and the \n\n\n302 Acknowledgments\nestablished base of products—that seldom concern scientists can \ndominate decisions in the world of business. While I was at Apple \nit had lost its way, but nothing is a better learning experience than \na company in trouble: you have to be a fast learner. \nI learned about schedules and budgets, about the competing \ndemand of the different divisions, about the role of marketing, \nindustrial design, and graphical, usability, and interactive design \n(today lumped together under the rubric of experience design). I \nvisited numerous companies across the United States, Europe, and \nAsia and talked with numerous partners and customers. It was a \ngreat learning experience. I am indebted to Dave Nagel, who hired \nand then promoted me to vice president of advanced technology, \nand to John Scully, the first CEO I worked with at Apple: John had \nthe correct vision of the future. I learned from many people, far \ntoo many to name (a quick review of the Apple people I worked \nclosely with and who are still in my contact list reveals 240 names). \nI learned about industrial design first from Bob Brunner, then \nfrom Jonathan (Joni) Ive. (Joni and I had to fight together to con-\nvince Apple management to produce his ideas. My, how Apple \nhas changed!) Joy Mountford ran the design team in advanced \ntechnology and Paulien Strijland ran the usability testing group \nin the product division. Tom Erickson, Harry Saddler, and Aus-\ntin Henderson worked for me in the User Experience Architect’s \noffice. Of particular significance to my increased understanding \nwere Larry Tesler, Ike Nassi, Doug Solomon, Michael Mace, Rick \nLaFaivre, Guerrino De Luca, and Hugh Dubberly. Of special im-\nportance were the Apple Fellows Alan Kay, Guy Kawasaki, and \nGary Starkweather. (I was originally hired as an Apple Fellow. \nAll Fellows reported to the VP of advanced technology.) Steve \nWozniak, by a peculiar quirk, was an Apple employee with me as \nhis boss, which allowed me to spend a delightful afternoon with \nhim. I apologize to those of you who were so helpful, but who I \nhave not included here. \nI thank my wife and critical reader, Julie Norman, for her pa-\ntience in repeated careful readings of the manuscripts, telling me \n\n\n \nAcknowledgments 303\nwhen I was stupid, redundant, and overly wordy. Eric Norman \nshowed up as a young child in two of the photos of the first edi-\ntion, and now, twenty-five years later, read the entire manuscript \nand provided cogent, valuable critiques. My assistant, Mimi Gard-\nner, held off the e-mail onslaught, allowing me to concentrate upon \nwriting, and of course my friends at the Nielsen Norman group \nprovided inspiration. Thank you, Jakob. \nDanny Bobrow of the Palo Alto Research Center, a frequent col-\nlaborator and coauthor of science papers for four decades, has \nprovided continual advice and cogent critiques of my ideas. Lera \nBoroditsky shared her research on space and time with me, and \nfurther delighted me by leaving Stanford to take a job at the de-\npartment I had founded, Cognitive Science, at UCSD. \nI am of course indebted to Professor Yutaka Sayeki of the Univer-\nsity of Tokyo for permission to use his story of how he managed \nthe turn signals on his motorcycle. I used the story in the first edi-\ntion, but disguised the name. A diligent Japanese reader figured \nout who it must have been, so for this edition, I asked Sayeki for \npermission to name him. \nProfessor Kun-Pyo Lee invited me to spend two months a year \nfor three years at the Korea Advanced Institute for Science and \nTechnology (KAIST) in its Industrial Design department, which \ngave me a much deeper insight into the teaching of design, Korean \ntechnology, and the culture of Northeast Asia, plus many new \nfriends and a permanent love for kimchi.\nAlex Kotlov, watching over the entrance to the building on Mar-\nket Street in San Francisco where I photographed the destination \ncontrol elevators, not only allowed me to photograph them, but \nthen turned out to have read DOET! \nIn the years since publication of POET/DOET, I have learned a \nconsiderable amount about the practice of design. At IDEO I am \nindebted to David Kelly and Tim Brown, as well as fellow IDEO \nFellows Barry Katz and Kristian Simsarian. I’ve had many fruitful \ndiscussions with Ken Friedman, former dean of the faculty of de-\nsign at Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, as well as \n\n\n304 Acknowledgments\nwith my colleagues at many of the major schools of design around \nthe world, in the United States, London, Delft, Eindhoven, Ivrea, \nMilan, Copenhagen, and Hong Kong. \nAnd thanks to Sandra Dijkstra, my literary agent for almost \nthirty years, with POET being one of her first books, but who now \nhas a large team of people and successful authors. Thanks, Sandy.\nAndrew Haskin and Kelly Fadem, at the time students at CCA, \nthe California College of the Arts in San Francisco, did all of the \ndrawings in the book—a vast improvement over the ones in the \nfirst edition that I did myself. \nJanaki (Mythily) Kumar, a User Experience designer at SAP, pro-\nvided valuable comments on real world practices. \nThomas Kelleher (TJ), my editor at Basic Books for this revised \nedition, provided rapid, efficient advice and editing suggestions \n(which led me to yet another massive revision of the manuscript \nthat vastly improved the book). Doug Sery served as my editor at \nMIT Press for the UK edition of this book (as well as for Living with \nComplexity). For this book, TJ did all the work and Doug provided \nencouragement.\n\n\n \n \n305\nGENERAL \nREADINGS \nAND NOTES\nIn the notes below, I first provide general readings. Then, chapter \nby chapter, I give the specific sources used or cited in the book.\nIn this world of rapid access to information, you can find infor-\nmation about the topics discussed here by yourself. Here is an ex-\nample: In Chapter 5, I discuss root cause analysis as well as the \nJapanese method called the Five Whys. Although my descriptions \nof these concepts in Chapter 5 are self-sufficient for most purposes, \nreaders who wish to learn more can use their favorite search en-\ngine with the critical phrases in quotes. \nMost of the relevant information can be found online. The prob-\nlem is that the addresses (URLs) are ephemeral. Today’s locations \nof valuable information may no longer be at the same place to-\nmorrow. The creaky, untrustworthy Internet, which is all we have \ntoday, may finally, thank goodness, be replaced by a superior \nscheme. Whatever the reason, the Internet addresses I provide may \nno longer work. The good news is that over the years that will \npass after the publication of this book, new and improved search \nmethods will certainly arise. It should be even easier to find more \ninformation about any of the concepts discussed in this book.\nThese notes provide excellent starting points. I provide critical \nreferences for the concepts discussed in the book, organized by \n\n\n306 General Readings\nthe chapters where they were discussed. The citations serve two \npurposes. First, they provide credit to the originators of the ideas. \nSecond, they serve as starting points to get a deeper understanding \nof the concepts. For more advanced information (as well as newer, \nfurther developments), go out and search. Enhanced search skills \nare important tools for success in the twenty-first century.\nGENERAL READINGS\nWhen the first edition of this book was published, the discipline \nof interaction design did not exist, the field of human-computer \ninteraction was in its infancy, and most studies were done under \nthe guise of “usability” or “user interface.” Several very different \ndisciplines were struggling to bring clarity to this enterprise, but \noften with little or no interaction among the disciplines. The ac-\nademic disciplines of computer science, psychology, human fac-\ntors, and ergonomics all knew of one another’s existence and often \nworked together, but design was not included. Why not design? \nNote that all the disciplines just listed are in the areas of science \nand engineering—in other words, technology. Design was then \nmostly taught in schools of art or architecture as a profession \nrather than as a research-based academic discipline. Designers had \nremarkably little contact with science and engineering. This meant \nthat although many excellent practitioners were trained, there was \nessentially no theory: design was learned through apprenticeship, \nmentorship, and experience.\nFew people in the academic disciplines were aware of the ex-\nistence of design as a serious enterprise, and as a result, design, \nand in particular, graphical, communication, and industrial de-\nsign worked completely independently of the newly emerging \ndiscipline of human-computer interaction and the existing disci-\nplines of human factors and ergonomics. Some product design was \ntaught in departments of mechanical engineering, but again, with \nlittle interaction with design. Design was simply not an academic \ndiscipline, so there was little or no mutual awareness or collabo-\nration. Traces of this distinction remain today, although design is \nmore and more becoming a research-based discipline, where pro-\n\n\n \nGeneral Readings 307\nfessors have experience in practice as well as PhDs. The boundar-\nies are disappearing.\nThis peculiar history of many independent, disparate groups all \nworking on similar issues makes it difficult to provide references \nthat cover both the academic side of interaction and experience \ndesign, and the applied side of design. The proliferation of books, \ntexts, and journals in human-computer interaction, experience de-\nsign, and usability is huge: too large to cite. In the materials that \nfollow, I provide a very restricted number of examples. When I \noriginally put together a list of works I considered important, it \nwas far too long. It fell prey to the problem described by Barry \nSchwartz in his book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less (2005). \nSo I decided to simplify by providing less. It is easy to find other \nworks, including important ones that will be published after this \nbook. Meanwhile, my apologies to my many friends whose im-\nportant and useful works had to be trimmed from my list.\nIndustrial designer Bill Moggridge was extremely influential in \nestablishing interaction within the design community. He played a \nmajor role in the design of the first portable computer. He was one \nof the three founders of IDEO, one of the world’s most influential \ndesign firms. He wrote two books of interviews with key people \nin the early development of the discipline: Designing Interactions \n(2007) and Designing Media (2010). As is typical of discussions from \nthe discipline of design, his works focus almost entirely upon the \npractice of design, with little attention to the science. Barry Katz, a \ndesign professor at San Francisco’s California College of the Arts, \nStanford’s d.school, and an IDEO Fellow, provides an excellent \nhistory of design practice within the community of companies \nin Silicon Valley, California: Ecosystem of Innovation: The History of \nSilicon Valley Design (2014). An excellent, extremely comprehen-\nsive history of the field of product design is provided by Bern-\nhard Bürdek’s Design: History, Theory, and Practice of Product Design \n(2005). Bürdek’s book, originally published in German but with an \nexcellent English translation, is the most comprehensive history of \nproduct design I have been able to find. I highly recommend it to \nthose who want to understand the historical foundations.\n\n\n308 General Readings\nModern designers like to characterize their work as providing \ndeep insight into the fundamentals of problems, going far beyond \nthe popular conception of design as making things pretty. Design-\ners emphasize this aspect of their profession by discussing the spe-\ncial way in which they approach problems, a method they have \ncharacterized as “design thinking.” A good introduction to this \ncomes from the book Change by Design (2009), by Tim Brown and \nBarry Katz. Brown is CEO of IDEO and Katz an IDEO Fellow (see \nthe previous paragraph).\nAn excellent introduction to design research is provided in Jan \nChipchase and Simon Steinhardt’s Hidden in Plain Sight (2013). \nThe book chronicles the life of a design researcher who studies \npeople by observing them in their homes, barber shops, and liv-\ning quarters around the world. Chipchase is executive creative \ndirector of global insights at Frog Design, working out of the \nShanghai office. The work of Hugh Beyer and Karen Holtzblatt \nin Contextual Design: Defining Customer-Centered Systems (1998) \npresents a powerful method of analyzing behavior; they have \nalso produced a useful workbook (Holtzblatt, Wendell, & Wood, \n2004).\nThere are many excellent books. Here are a few more:\nBuxton, W. (2007). Sketching user experience: Getting the design right and the right \ndesign. San Francisco, CA: Morgan Kaufmann.

Both are excellent, and although \nexpensive, well worth the price for anyone who intends to work \nin these fields. The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook, as the ti-\ntle suggests, focuses primarily on computer-enhanced interactions \nwith technology, whereas the Handbook of Cognitive Engineering has \na much broader coverage. Which book is better? That depends upon \nwhat problem you are working on. For my work, both are essential. \nFinally, let me recommend two websites: \nInteraction Design Foundation: Take special note of its Encyclopedia articles. \nwww.interaction-design.org\nSIGCHI: The Computer-Human Interaction Special Interest Group for ACM.\nwww.sigchi.org\nCHAPTER ONE: THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS\n2 \n Coffeepot for Masochists: This was created by the French artist Jacques \nCarelman (1984). The photograph shows a coffeepot inspired by \nCarelman, but owned by me. Photograph by Aymin Shamma for the \nauthor.\n10 \n Affordances: The perceptual psychologist J. J. Gibson invented the word \naffordance to explain how people navigated the world (Gibson, 1979). \nI introduced the term into the world of interaction design in the first \nedition of this book (Norman, 1988). Since then, the number of writings \non affordance has been enormous. Confusion over the appropriate way \nto use the term prompted me to introduce the concept of “signifier” in \nmy book Living with Complexity (Norman, 2010), discussed throughout \nthis book, but especially in Chapters 1 and 4.\nCHAPTER TWO: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY ACTIONS\n38  Gulfs of execution and evaluation: The story of the gulfs and bridges of \nexecution and evaluation came from research performed with Ed \nHutchins and Jim Hollan, then part of a joint research team between the \nNaval Personnel Research and Development Center and the University \nof California, San Diego (Hollan and Hutchins are now professors of \n\n\n310 Notes to Chapter 2\ncognitive science at the University of California, San Diego). The work \nexamined the development of computer systems that were easier to \nlearn and easier to use, and in particular, of what has been called \ndirect manipulation computer systems. The initial work is described \nin the chapter “Direct Manipulation Interfaces” in the book from our \nlaboratories, User Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-\nComputer Interaction (Hutchins, Hollan, & Norman, 1986). Also see the \npaper by Hollan, Hutchins, and David Kirsh, “Distributed Cognition: A \nNew Foundation for Human-Computer Interaction Research” (Hollan, \nHutchins, & Kirsh, 2000).\n43  Levitt: “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-\ninch hole!” See Christensen, Cook, & Hal, 2006. The fact that Harvard \nBusiness School marketing professor Theodore Levitt is credited with \nthe quote about the drill and the hole is a good example of Stigler’s law: \n“No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer.” Thus, \nLevitt himself attributed the statement about drills and holes to Leo \nMcGinneva (Levitt, 1983). Stigler’s law is, itself, an example of the law: \nStigler, a professor of statistics, wrote that he learned the law from the \nsociologist Robert Merton. See more at Wikipedia, “Stigler’s Law of \nEponymy” (Wikipedia contributors, 2013c).\n46  Doorknob: The question “In the house you lived in three houses ago, as \nyou entered the front door, was the doorknob on the left or right?” comes \nfrom my paper “Memory, Knowledge, and the Answering of Questions” \n(Norman, 1973).\n53  Visceral, behavioral, and reflective: Daniel Kahneman’s book, Thinking Fast \nand Slow (Kahneman, 2011), gives an excellent introduction to modern \nconceptions of the role of conscious and subconscious processing. The \ndistinctions between visceral, behavioral, and reflective processing \nform the basis of my book Emotional Design (Norman, 2002, 2004). This \nmodel of the human cognitive and emotional system is described in \nmore technical detail in the scientific paper I wrote with Andrew Ortony \nand William Revelle: “The Role of Affect and Proto-affect in Effective \nFunctioning” (Ortony, Norman, & Revelle, 2005). Also see “Designers \nand Users: Two Perspectives on Emotion and Design” (Norman & \nOrtony, 2006). Emotional Design contains numerous examples of the role \nof design at all three levels.\n58  Thermostat: The valve theory of the thermostat is taken from Kempton, \na study published in the journal Cognitive Science (1986). Intelligent \nthermostats try to predict when they will be required, turning on or \noff earlier than the simple control illustrated in Chapter 2 can specify, \nto ensure that the desired temperature is reached at the desired time, \nwithout over- or undershooting the target.\n63  Positive psychology: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s work on flow can be found \nin his several books on the topic (1990, 1997). Martin (Marty) Seligman \ndeveloped the concept of learned helplessness, and then applied it to \ndepression (Seligman, 1992). However, he decided that it was wrong for \n\n\n \nNotes to Chapter 3 311\npsychology to continually focus upon difficulties and abnormalities, \nso he teamed up with Csikszentmihalyi to create a movement for \npositive psychology. An excellent introduction is provided in the article \nby the two of them in the journal American Psychologist (Seligman & \nCsikszentmihalyi, 2000). Since then, positive psychology has expanded \nto include books, journals, and conferences.\n66  Human error: People blame themselves: Unfortunately, blaming the user \nis imbedded in the legal system. When major accidents occur, official \ncourts of inquiry are set up to assess the blame. More and more often, the \nblame is attributed to “human error.” But in my experience, human error \nusually is a result of poor design: why was the system ever designed so \nthat a single act by a single person could cause calamity? An important \nbook on this topic is Charles Perrow’s Normal Accidents (1999). Chapter 5 \nof this book provides a detailed examination of human error.\n72  Feedforward: Feedforward is an old concept from control theory, but I \nfirst encountered it applied to the seven stages of action in the paper \nby Jo Vermeulen, Kris Luyten, Elise van den Hoven, and Karin Coninx \n(2013).\nCHAPTER THREE: KNOWLEDGE IN THE HEAD AND IN THE WORLD\n74 \n American coins: Ray Nickerson and Marilyn Adams, as well as David \nRubin and Theda Kontis, showed that people could neither recall \nnor recognize accurately the pictures and words on American coins \n(Nickerson & Adams, 1979; Rubin & Kontis, 1983).\n80  French coins: The quotation about the French government release of the \n10-franc coin comes from an article by Stanley Meisler (1986), reprinted \nwith permission of the Los Angeles Times.\n80  Descriptions in memory: The suggestion that memory storage and retrieval \nis mediated through partial descriptions was put forth in a paper with \nDanny Bobrow (Norman & Bobrow, 1979). We argued that, in general, \nthe required specificity of a description depends on the set of items \namong which a person is trying to distinguish. Memory retrieval can \ntherefore involve a prolonged series of attempts during which the initial \nretrieval descriptions yield incomplete or erroneous results, so that the \nperson must keep trying, each retrieval attempt coming closer to the \nanswer and helping to make the description more precise.\n83  Constraints of rhyming: Given just the cues for meaning (the first task), \nthe people David C. Rubin and Wanda T. Wallace tested could guess the \nthree target words used in these examples only 0 percent, 4 percent, and \n0 percent of the time, respectively. Similarly, when the same target words \nwere cued only by rhymes, they still did quite poorly, guessing the targets \ncorrectly only 0 percent, 0 percent, and 4 percent of the time, respectively. \nThus, each cue alone offered little assistance. Combining the meaning \ncue with the rhyming cue led to perfect performance: the people got the \ntarget words 100 percent of the time (Rubin & Wallace, 1989).\n\n\n312 Notes to Chapter 3\n86  ‘Ali Baba: Alfred Bates Lord’s work is summarized in his book The Singer \nof Tales (1960). The quotation from “‘Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves” \ncomes from The Arabian Nights: Tales of Wonder and Magnificence, selected \nand edited by Padraic Colum, translated by Edward William Lane \n(Colum & Ward, 1953). The names here are in an unfamiliar form: most \nof us know the magic phrase as “Open Sesame,” but according to Colum, \n“Simsim” is the authentic transliteration.\n87  Passwords: How do people cope with passwords? There are lots of studies: \n(Anderson, 2008; Florêncio, Herley, & Coskun, 2007; National Research \nCouncil Steering Committee on the Usability, Security, and Privacy of \nComputer Systems, 2010; Norman, 2009; Schneier, 2000).\nTo find the most common passwords, just search using some phrase \nsuch as “most common passwords.” My article on security, which led \nto numerous newspaper column references to it, is available on my \nwebsite and was also published in the magazine for human-computer \ninteraction, Interactions (Norman, 2009).\n89  Hiding places: The quotation about professional thieves’ knowledge of \nhow people hide things comes from Winograd and Soloway’s study “On \nForgetting the Locations of Things Stored in Special Places” (1986).\n93  Mnemonics: Mnemonic methods were covered in my book Memory and \nAttention, and although that book is old, the mnemonic techniques are \neven older, and are still unchanged (Norman, 1969, 1976). I discuss the \neffort of retrieval in Learning and Memory (Norman, 1982). Mnemonic \ntechniques are easy to find: just search the web for “mnemonics.” \nSimilarly, the properties of short- and long-term memory are readily \nfound by an Internet search or in any text on experimental psychology, \ncognitive psychology, or neuropsychology (as opposed to clinical \npsychology) or a text on cognitive science. Alternatively, search online \nfor “human memory,” “working memory,” “short-term memory” or \n“long-term memory.” Also see the book by Harvard psychologist Daniel \nSchacter, The Seven Sins of Memory (2001). What are Schacter’s seven sins? \nTransience, absent-mindedness, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility, \npersistence, and bias.\n101  Whitehead: Alfred North Whitehead’s quotation about the power of \nautomated behavior is from Chapter 5 of his book An Introduction to \nMathematics (1911). \n107  Prospective memory: Considerable research on prospective memory and \nmemory for the future is summarized in the articles by Dismukes on \nprospective memory and the review by Cristina Atance and Daniela \nO’Neill on memory for the future, or what they call “episodic future \nthinking” (Atance & O’Neill, 2001; Dismukes, 2012).\n112  Transactive memory: The term transactive memory was coined by Harvard \nprofessor of psychology Daniel Wegner (Lewis & Herndon, 2011; Wegner, \nD. M., 1987; Wegner, T. G., & Wegner, D. M., 1995).\n113  Stove controls: The difficulty in mapping stove controls to burners has \nbeen understood by human factors experts for over fifty years: Why are \n\n\n \nNotes to Chapter 4 313\nstoves still designed so badly? This issue was addressed in 1959, the very \nfirst year of the Human Factors Journal (Chapanis & Lindenbaum, 1959).\n118  Culture and design: My discussion of the impact of culture on mappings \nwas heavily informed by my discussions with Lera Boroditsky, then \nat Stanford University, but now in the cognitive science department \nat the University of California, San Diego. See her book chapter “How \nLanguages Construct Time” (2011). Studies of the Australian Aborigine \nwere reported by Núñez & Sweetser (2006).\nCHAPTER FOUR: KNOWING WHAT TO DO: \nCONSTRAINTS, DISCOVERABILITY, AND FEEDBACK\n126  InstaLoad: A description of Microsoft’s InstaLoad technology for battery \ncontacts is available on its website: www.microsoft.com/hardware\n/en-us/support/licensing-instaload-overview.\n129  Cultural frames: See Roger Schank and Robert B. Abelson’s Scripts, \nPlans, Goals, and Understanding (1977) or Erving Goffman’s classic and \nextremely influential books The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959) \nand Frame Analysis (1974). I recommend Presentation as the most relevant \n(and easiest to read) of his works.\n129  Violating social conventions: “Try violating cultural norms and see how \nuncomfortable that makes you and the other people.” Jan Chipchase and \nSimon Steinhardt’s Hidden in Plain Sight provides many examples of how \ndesign researchers can deliberately violate social conventions so as to \nunderstand how a culture works. Chipchase reports an experiment in \nwhich able-bodied young people request that seated subway passengers \ngive up their seat to them. The experimenters were surprised by two \nthings. First, a large proportion of people obeyed. Second, the people \nmost affected were the experimenters themselves: they had to force \nthemselves to make the requests and then felt bad about it for a long \ntime afterward. A deliberate violation of social constraints can be \nuncomfortable for both the violator and the violated (Chipchase & \nSteinhardt, 2013).\n137  Light switch panel: For the construction of my home light switch panel, \nI relied heavily on the electrical and mechanical ingenuity of Dave \nWargo, who actually did the design, construction, and installation of the \nswitches.\n156  Natural sounds: Bill Gaver, now a prominent design researcher at \nGoldsmiths College, University of London (UK), first alerted me to \nthe importance of natural sounds in his PhD dissertation and later \npublications (Gaver, W., 1997; Gaver, W. W., 1989). There has been \nconsiderable research on sound since the early days: see, for example, \nGygi & Shafiro (2010).\n160  Electric vehicles: The quotation from the US government rule on sounds \nfor electric vehicles can be found on the Department of Transportation’s \nwebsite (2013). \n\n\n314 Notes to Chapter 5\nCHAPTER FIVE: HUMAN ERROR? NO, BAD DESIGN\nThere has been a lot of work on the study of error, human reliabil-\nity, and resilience. A good source, besides the items cited below, is \nthe Wiki of Science article on human error (Wiki of Science, 2013). \nAlso see the book Behind Human Error (Woods, Decker, Cook, Jo-\nhannesen, & Sarter, 2010). \nTwo of the most important workers in human error are British \npsychologist James Reason and Danish engineer Jens Rasmussen. \nAlso see the books by the Swedish investigator Sidney Dekker, and \nMIT professor Nancy Leveson (Dekker, 2011, 2012, 2013; Leveson, \nN., 2012; Leveson, N. G., 1995; Rasmussen, Duncan, & Leplat, 1987; \nRasmussen, Pejtersen, & Goodstein, 1994; Reason, J. T., 1990, 2008).\nUnless otherwise noted, all the examples of slips in this chapter \nwere collected by me, primarily from the errors of myself, my re-\nsearch associates, my colleagues, and my students. Everyone dili-\ngently recorded his or her slips, with the requirement that only the \nones that had been immediately recorded would be added to the \ncollection. Many were first published in Norman (1981). \n165  F-22 crash: The analysis of the Air Force F-22 crash comes from a government \nreport (Inspector General United States Department of Defense, 2013). \n(This report also contains the original Air Force report as Appendix C.) \n170  Slips and mistakes: The descriptions of skill-based, rule-based, and \nknowledge-based behavior is taken from Jens Rasmussen’s paper on \nthe topic (1983), which still stands as one of the best introductions. The \nclassification of errors into slips and mistakes was done jointly by me and \nReason. The classification of mistakes into rule-based and knowledge-\nbased follows the work of Rasmussen (Rasmussen, Goodstein, Andersen, \n& Olsen, 1988; Rasmussen, Pejtersen, & Goodstein, 1994; Reason, J. T., \n1990, 1997, 2008). Memory lapse errors (both slips and mistakes) were not \noriginally distinguished from other errors: they were put into separate \ncategories later, but not quite the same way I have done here.\n172  “Gimli Glider”: The so-called Gimli Glider accident was an Air Canada Boe-\ning 767 that ran out of fuel and had to glide to a landing at Gimli, a de-\ncommissioned Canadian Air Force base. There were numerous mistakes: \nsearch for “Gimli Glider accident.” (I recommend the Wikipedia treatment.)\n174  Capture error: The category “capture error” was invented by James \nReason (1979).\n178  Airbus: The difficulties with the Airbus and its modes are described \nin (Aviation Safety Network, 1992; Wikipedia contributors, 2013a). For \na disturbing description of another design problem with the Airbus—\n\n\n \nNotes to Chapter 5 315\nthat the two pilots (the captain and the first officer) can both control the \njoysticks, but there is no feedback, so one pilot does not know what the other \npilot is doing—see the article in the British newspaper The Telegraph \n(Ross & Tweedie, 2012).\n181  The Kiss nightclub fire in Santa Maria, Brazil: It is described in numerous \nBrazilian and American newspapers (search the web for “Kiss nightclub \nfire”). I first learned about it from the New York Times (Romero, 2013).\n186  Tenerife crash: My source for information about the Tenerife crash is from \na report by Roitsch, Babcock, and Edmunds issued by the American \nAirline Pilots Association (Roitsch, Babcock, & Edmunds, undated). \nIt is perhaps not too surprising that it differs in interpretation from \nthe Spanish government’s report (Spanish Ministry of Transport and \nCommunications, 1978), which in turn differs from the report by the \nDutch Aircraft Accident Inquiry Board. A nice review of the 1977 Tenerife \naccident—written in 2007—that shows its long-lasting importance has \nbeen written by Patrick Smith for the website Salon.com (Smith, 2007, \nFriday, April 6, 04:00 AM PDT).\n188  Air Florida crash: The information and quotations about the Air Florida \ncrash are from the report of the National Transportation Safety Board \n(1982). See also the two books entitled Pilot Error (Hurst, 1976; Hurst, R. & \nHurst, L. R., 1982). The two books are quite different. The second is better \nthan the first, in part because at the time the first book was written, not \nmuch scientific evidence was available.\n190  Checklists in medicine: Duke University’s examples of knowledge-based \nmistakes can be found at Duke University Medical Center (2013). An \nexcellent summary of the use of checklists in medicine—and the many \nsocial pressures that have slowed up its adoption—is provided by Atul \nGawande (2009).\n192  Jidoka: The quotation from Toyota about Jidoka, and the Toyota \nProduction System comes from the auto maker’s website (Toyota Motor \nEurope Corporate Site, 2013). Poka-yoke is described in many books and \nwebsites. I found the two books written by or with the assistance of the \noriginator, Shigeo Shingo, to provide a valuable perspective (Nikkan \nKogyo Shimbun, 1988; Shingo, 1986).\n193  Aviation safety: The website for NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System \nprovides details of the system, along with a history of its reports (NASA, \n2013).\n197  Hindsight: Baruch Fischhoff’s study is called “Hindsight ≠ Foresight: \nThe Effect of Outcome Knowledge on Judgment Under Uncertainty” \n(1975). And while you are at it, see his more recent work (Fischhoff, 2012; \nFischhoff & Kadvany, 2011).\n198  Designing for error: I discuss the idea of designing for error in a paper \nin Communications of the ACM, in which I analyze a number of the slips \npeople make in using computer systems and suggest system design \nprinciples that might minimize those errors (Norman, 1983). This \nphilosophy also pervades the book that our research team put together: \n\n\n316 Notes to Chapter 5\nUser Centered System Design (Norman & Draper, 1986); two chapters are \nespecially relevant to the discussions here: my “Cognitive Engineering” \nand the one I wrote with Clayton Lewis, “Designing for Error.”\n200  Multitasking: There are many studies of the dangers and inefficiencies of \nmultitasking. A partial review is given by Spink, Cole, & Waller (2008). \nDavid L. Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah have done \nnumerous studies demonstrating rather severe impairment in driving \nbehavior while using cell phones (Strayer & Drews, 2007; Strayer, Drews, \n& Crouch, 2006). Even pedestrians are distracted by cell phone usage, \nas demonstrated by a team of researchers from West Washington \nUniversity (Hyman, Boss, Wise, McKenzie, & Caggiano, 2010).\n200  Unicycling clown: The clever study of the invisible clown, riding a \nunicycle, “Did you see the unicycling clown? Inattentional blindness \nwhile walking and talking on a cell phone” was done by Hyman, Boss, \nWise, McKenzie, & Caggiano (2010).\n208  Swiss cheese model: James Reason introduced his extremely influential \nSwiss cheese model in 1990 (Reason, J., 1990; Reason, J. T., 1997).\n210  Hersman: Deborah Hersman’s description of the design philosophy for \naircraft comes from her talk on February 7, 2013, discussing the NTSB’s \nattempts to understand the cause of the fires in the battery compartments \nof Boeing 787 aircraft. Although the fires caused airplanes to make \nemergency landings, no passengers or crew were injured: the multiple \nlayers of redundant protection maintained safety. Nonetheless, the \nfires and resulting damage were unexpected and serious enough that \nall Boeing 787 airlines were grounded until all parties involved had \ncompleted a thorough investigation of the causes of the incident and \nthen gone through a new certification process with the Federal Aviation \nAgency (for the United States, and through the corresponding agencies in \nother countries). Although this was expensive and greatly inconvenient, it \nis an example of good proactive practice: take measures before accidents \nlead to injury and death (National Transportation Safety Board, 2013).\n212  Resilience engineering: The excerpt from “Prologue: Resilience Engineering \nConcepts,” in the book Resilience Engineering, is reprinted by permission \nof the publishers (Hollnagel, Woods, & Leveson, 2006).\n213  Automation: Much of my research and writings have addressed issues of \nautomation. An early paper, “Coffee Cups in the Cockpit,” addresses this \nproblem as well as the fact that when talking about incidents in a large \ncountry—or that occur worldwide—a “one-in-a-million chance” is not \ngood enough odds (Norman, 1992). My book The Design of Future Things \ndeals extensively with this issue (Norman, 2007).\n214  Royal Majesty accident: An excellent analysis of the mode error accident \nwith the cruise ship Royal Majesty is contained in Asaf Degani’s book on \nautomation, Taming HAL: Designing Interfaces Beyond 2001 (Degani, 2004), as \nwell as in the analyses by Lützhöft and Dekker and the official NTSB report \n(Lützhöft & Dekker, 2002; National Transportation Safety Board, 1997). \n",

Brown is CEO of IDEO and Katz a professor at \nthe California College of the Arts, visiting professor at Stanford’s \nd.school, and an IDEO Fellow. There are multiple Internet sources; \nI like designthinkingforeducators.com.\n220  Double diverge-converge pattern: The double diverge-converge pattern was \nfirst introduced by the British Design Council in 2005, which called it the \n“Double-Diamond Design Process Model” (Design Council, 2005).\n221  HCD process: The human-centered design process has many variants, \neach similar in spirit but different in the details. A nice summary of the \nmethod I describe is provided by the HCD book and toolkit from the \ndesign firm IDEO (IDEO, 2013).\n227  Prototyping: For prototyping, see Buxton’s book and handbook on \nsketching (Buxton, 2007; Greenberg, Carpendale, Marquardt, & Buxton, \n2012). There are multiple methods used by designers to understand the \nnature of the problem and come to a potential solution. Vijay Kumar’s \n101 Design Methods (2013) doesn’t even cover them all. Kumar’s book is \nan excellent treatment of design research methods, but its focus is on \ninnovation, not the production of products, so it does not cover the actual \ndevelopment cycle. Physical prototyping, their tests, and iterations are \noutside the domain, as are the practical concerns of the marketplace, the \ntopic of the last part of this chapter and all of chapter 7.\n227  Wizard of Oz technique: The Wizard of Oz technique is named after \nL. Frank Baum’s book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Baum & Denslow, \n1900). My use of the technique is described in the resulting paper from \nthe group headed by artificial intelligence researcher Danny Bobrow at \nwhat was then called the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Bobrow \net al., 1977). The “graduate student” sitting in the other room was Allen \nMunro, who then went on to a distinguished research career.\n229  Nielsen: Jakob Nielsen’s argument that five users is the ideal number for \nmost tests can be found on the Nielsen Norman group’s website (Nielsen, \n2013).\n233  Three goals: Marc Hassenzahl’s use of the three levels of goals (be-goals, \ndo-goals, and motor-goals) is described in many places, but I strongly \nrecommend his book Experience Design (Hassenzahl, 2010). The three \ngoals come from the work of Charles Carver and Michael Scheier in their \nlandmark book on the use of feedback models, chaos, and dynamical \ntheory to explain much of human behavior (Carver & Scheier, 1998).\n246  Age and performance: A good review of the impact of age on human factors \nis provided by Frank Schieber (2003). The report by Igo Grossman and \n\n\n318 Notes to Chapter 7\ncolleagues is a typical example of research showing that careful studies \nreveal superior performance with age (Grossmann et al., 2010).\n254  Swatch International Time: Swatch’s development of .beat time and the \nFrench decimal time are discussed in the Wikipedia article on decimal \ntime (Wikipedia contributors, 2013b). \nCHAPTER SEVEN: DESIGN IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS\n261  Creeping featurism: A note for the technology historians. I’ve managed to \ntrace the origin of this term to a talk by John Mashey in 1976 (Mashey, \n1976). At that time Mashey was a computer scientist at Bell Laboratories, \nwhere he was one of the early developers of UNIX, a well-known \ncomputer operating system (which is still active as Unix, Linux, and the \nkernel underlying Apple’s Mac OS).\n262  Youngme Moon: Youngme Moon’s book Different: Escaping the Competitive \nHerd (Moon, 2010) argues that “If there is one strain of conventional \nwisdom pervading every company in every industry, it is the importance \nof competing hard to differentiate yourself from the competition. And \nyet going head-to-head with the competition—with respect to features, \nproduct augmentations, and so on—has the perverse effect of making \nyou just like everyone else.” (From the jacket of her book: see http://\nyoungmemoon.com/Jacket.html.)\n266  Word-gesture system: The word-gesture system that works by tracing the \nletters on the screen keyboard to type rapidly and efficiently (although \nnot as fast as with a traditional ten-finger keyboard) is described in \nconsiderable detail by Shumin Zhai and Per Ola Kristensson, two of the \ndevelopers of this method of typing (Zhai & Kristensson, 2012).\n269  Multitouch screens: In the more than thirty years multitouch screens have \nbeen in the laboratories, numerous companies have launched products \nand failed. Nimish Mehta is credited with the invention of multitouch, \ndiscussed in his master’s thesis (1982) from the University of Toronto. \nBill Buxton (2012), one of the pioneers in this field, provides a valuable \nreview (he was working with multitouch displays in the early 1980s at \nthe University of Toronto). Another excellent review of multitouch and \ngestural systems in general (as well as design principles) is provided \nby Dan Saffer in his book Designing Gestural Interfaces (2009). The story \nof Fingerworks and Apple is readily found by searching the web for \n“Fingerworks.”\n270 Stigler’s law: See the comment about this in the notes for Chapter 2.\n271  Telephonoscope: The illustration of the “Telephonoscope” was originally \npublished in the December 9, 1878, issue of the British magazine Punch \n(for its 1879 Almanack). The picture comes from Wikipedia (Wikipedia \ncontributors, 2013d), where it is in the public domain because of its age.\n276  QWERTY keyboard: The history of the QWERTY keyboard is discussed \nin numerous articles. I thank Professor Neil Kay of University of \nStrathclyde for our e-mail correspondence and his article “Rerun the \n\n\n \nNotes to Chapter 7 319\nTape of History and QWERTY Always Wins” (2013). This article led me \nto the “QWERTY People Archive” website by the Japanese researchers \nKoichi and Motoko Yasuoka, an incredibly detailed, valuable resource \nfor those interested in the history of the keyboard, and in particular, \nof the QWERTY configuration (Yasuoka & Yasuoka, 2013). The article \non the typewriter in the 1872 Scientific American is fun to read: the style \nof Scientific American has changed drastically since then (Anonymous, \n1872).\n278  Dvorak keyboard: Is Dvorak faster than QWERTY? Yes, but not by much: \nDiane Fisher and I studied a variety of keyboard layouts. We thought that \nalphabetically organized keys would be superior for beginners. No, they \nweren’t: we discovered that knowledge of the alphabet was not useful \nin finding the keys. Our studies of alphabetical and Dvorak keyboards \nwere published in the journal Human Factors (Norman & Fisher, 1984).\nAdmirers of the Dvorak keyboard claim much more than a 10 percent \nimprovement, as well as faster learning rates and less fatigue. But I \nwill stick by my studies and my statements. If you want to read more, \nincluding a worthwhile treatment of the history of the typewriter, see \nthe book Cognitive Aspects of Skilled Typewriting, edited by William E. \nCooper, which includes several chapters of research from my laboratory \n(Cooper, W. E., 1963; Norman & Fisher, 1984; Norman & Rumelhart, 1963; \nRumelhart & Norman, 1982).\n278  Keyboard ergonomics: Health aspects of keyboards are reported in \nNational Institute of Health (2013).\n279  Incremental and radical innovation: The Italian business professor Roberto \nVerganti and I discuss the principles of incremental and radical \ninnovation (Norman & Verganti, 2014; Verganti, 2009, 2010).\n281  Hill climbing: There are very good descriptions of the hill-climbing \nprocess for design in Christopher Alexander’s book Notes on the Synthesis \nof Form (1964) and Chris Jones’s book Design Methods (1992; also see Jones, \n1984).\n286  Humans versus machines: The remarks by MIT professor Erik Brynjolfsson \nwere made in his talk at the June 2012 National Academy of Engineering \nsymposium on manufacturing, design, and innovation (Brynjolfsson, \n2012). His book, coauthored with Andrew McAfee—Race Against the \nMachine: How the Digital Revolution Is Accelerating Innovation, Driving \nProductivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy—\ncontains an excellent treatment of design and innovation (Brynjolfsson \n& McAfee, 2011).\n290  Interactive media: Al Gore’s interactive media book is Our Choice (2011). \nSome of the videos from my early interactive book are still available: see \nNorman (1994 and 2011b).\n295  Rise of the small: The section “The Rise of the Small” is taken from my \nessay written for the hundredth anniversary of the Steelcase company, \nreprinted here with Steelcase’s permission (Norman, 2011a).\n\n\n \n \n321\nREFERENCES\nAlexander, C.

It is intended to be enjoy-\nable and informative for everyone: everyday people, technical peo-\nple, designers, and nondesigners. One goal is to turn readers into \ngreat observers of the absurd, of the poor design that gives rise \nto so many of the problems of modern life, especially of modern \ntechnology. It will also turn them into observers of the good, of \nthe ways in which thoughtful designers have worked to make our \nlives easier and smoother. Good design is actually a lot harder to \nnotice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs \nso well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing \nattention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its \ninadequacies, making itself very noticeable.\nAlong the way I lay out the fundamental principles required \nto eliminate problems, to turn our everyday stuff into enjoyable \nproducts that provide pleasure and satisfaction. The combination \nof good observation skills and good design principles is a powerful \n",

Because we are all designers in the sense \nthat all of us deliberately design our lives, our rooms, and the way \nwe do things. We can also design workarounds, ways of overcom-\ning the flaws of existing devices. So, one purpose of this book is to \ngive back your control over the products in your life: to know how \nto select usable and understandable ones, to know how to fix those \nthat aren’t so usable or understandable.\nThe first edition of the book has lived a long and healthy life. Its \nname was quickly changed to Design of Everyday Things (DOET) \nto make the title less cute and more descriptive. DOET has been \nread by the general public and by designers. It has been assigned \nin courses and handed out as required readings in many compa-\nnies. Now, more than twenty years after its release, the book is \nstill popular. I am delighted by the response and by the number \nof people who correspond with me about it, who send me further \nexamples of thoughtless, inane design, plus occasional examples \nof superb design. Many readers have told me that it has changed \ntheir lives, making them more sensitive to the problems of life and \nto the needs of people. Some changed their careers and became \ndesigners because of the book. The response has been amazing.\nWhy a Revised Edition?\nIn the twenty-five years that have passed since the first edition \nof the book, technology has undergone massive change. Neither \ncell phones nor the Internet were in widespread usage when I \nwrote the book. Home networks were unheard of. Moore’s law \nproclaims that the power of computer processors doubles roughly \nevery two years. This means that today’s computers are five thou-\nsand times more powerful than the ones available when the book \nwas first written.\nAlthough the fundamental design principles of The Design of \nEveryday Things are still as true and as important as when the first \nedition was written, the examples were badly out of date. “What \nis a slide projector?” students ask. Even if nothing else was to be \nchanged, the examples had to be updated.\n",

      "content": " \nPreface to the Revised Edition xiii\nThe principles of effective design also had to be brought up to \ndate. Human-centered design (HCD) has emerged since the first \nedition, partially inspired by that book. This current edition has \nan entire chapter devoted to the HCD process of product devel-\nopment. The first edition of the book focused upon making prod-\nucts understandable and usable. The total experience of a product \ncovers much more than its usability: aesthetics, pleasure, and fun \nplay critically important roles. There was no discussion of plea-\nsure, enjoyment, or emotion. Emotion is so important that I wrote \nan entire book, Emotional Design, about the role it plays in design. \nThese issues are also now included in this edition.\nMy experiences in industry have taught me about the com-\nplexities of the real world, how cost and schedules are critical, \nthe need to pay attention to competition, and the importance of \nmulti disciplinary teams. I learned that the successful product has \nto appeal to customers, and the criteria they use to determine what \nto purchase may have surprisingly little overlap with the aspects \nthat are important during usage. The best products do not always \nsucceed. Brilliant new technologies might take decades to become \naccepted. To understand products, it is not enough to understand \ndesign or technology: it is critical to understand business.\nWhat Has Changed?\nFor readers familiar with the earlier edition of this book, here is a \nbrief review of the changes.\nWhat has changed? Not much. Everything.\nWhen I started, I assumed that the basic principles were still \ntrue, so all I needed to do was update the examples. But in the \nend, I rewrote everything. Why? Because although all the princi-\nples still applied, in the twenty-five years since the first edition, \nmuch has been learned. I also now know which parts were diffi-\ncult and therefore need better explanations. In the interim, I also \nwrote many articles and six books on related topics, some of which \nI thought important to include in the revision. For example, the \noriginal book says nothing of what has come to be called user \nexperience (a term that I was among the first to use, when in the \n",

This needed to be here.\nFinally, my exposure to industry taught me much about the way \nproducts actually get deployed, so I added considerable infor-\nmation about the impact of budgets, schedules, and competitive \npressures. When I wrote the original book, I was an academic re-\nsearcher. Today, I have been an industry executive (Apple, HP, and \nsome startups), a consultant to numerous companies, and a board \nmember of companies. I had to include my learnings from these \nexperiences.\nFinally, one important component of the original edition was \nits brevity. The book could be read quickly as a basic, general \nintroduction. I kept that feature unchanged. I tried to delete as \nmuch as I added to keep the total size about the same (I failed). \nThe book is meant to be an introduction: advanced discussions of \nthe topics, as well as a large number of important but more ad-\nvanced topics, have been left out to maintain the compactness. The \nprevious edition lasted from 1988 to 2013. If the new edition is to \nlast as long, 2013 to 2038, I had to be careful to choose examples \nthat would not be dated twenty-five years from now. As a result, \nI have tried not to give specific company examples. After all, who \nremembers the companies of twenty-five years ago? Who can \npredict what new companies will arise, what existing companies \nwill disappear, and what new technologies will arise in the next \ntwenty-five years? The one thing I can predict with certainty is that \nthe principles of human psychology will remain the same, which \nmeans that the design principles here, based on psychology, on the \nnature of human cognition, emotion, action, and interaction with \nthe world, will remain unchanged.\nHere is a brief summary of the changes, chapter by chapter.\nChapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things\nSignifiers are the most important addition to the chapter, a con-\ncept first introduced in my book Living with Complexity. The first \nedition had a focus upon affordances, but although affordances \n",

As a result, affordances \nhave created much confusion in the world of design. Affor-\ndances define what actions are possible. Signifiers specify how \npeople discover those possibilities: signifiers are signs, percep-\ntible signals of what can be done. Signifiers are of far more im-\nportance to designers than are affordances. Hence, the extended \ntreatment.\nI added a very brief section on HCD, a term that didn’t yet exist \nwhen the first edition was published, although looking back, we \nsee that the entire book was about HCD.\nOther than that, the chapter is the same, and although all the \nphotographs and drawings are new, the examples are pretty much \nthe same.\nChapter 2: The Psychology of Everyday Actions\nThe chapter has one major addition to the coverage in the first edi-\ntion: the addition of emotion. The seven-stage model of action has \nproven to be influential, as has the three-level model of processing \n(introduced in my book Emotional Design). In this chapter I show \nthe interplay between these two, show that different emotions \narise at the different stages, and show which stages are primarily \nlocated at each of the three levels of processing (visceral, for the \nelementary levels of motor action performance and perception; be-\nhavioral, for the levels of action specification and initial interpre-\ntation of the outcome; and reflective, for the development of goals, \nplans, and the final stage of evaluation of the outcome).\nChapter 3: Knowledge in the Head and in the World\nAside from improved and updated examples, the most important \naddition to this chapter is a section on culture, which is of special \nimportance to my discussion of “natural mappings.” What seems \nnatural in one culture may not be in another. The section examines \nthe way different cultures view time—the discussion might sur-\nprise you.\n",

No, Bad Design\nThe basics are unchanged, but the chapter itself has been heavily \nrevised. I update the classification of errors to fit advances since \nthe publication of the first edition. In particular, I now divide slips \ninto two main categories—action-based and memory lapses; and \nmistakes into three categories—rule-based, knowledge-based, \nand memory lapses. (These distinctions are now common, but I \nintroduce a slightly different way to treat memory lapses.)\nAlthough the multiple classifications of slips provided in the \nfirst edition are still valid, many have little or no implications for \ndesign, so they have been eliminated from the revision. I provide \nmore design-relevant examples. I show the relationship of the clas-\nsification of errors, slips, and mistakes to the seven-stage model of \naction, something new in this revision.\nThe chapter concludes with a quick discussion of the difficulties \nposed by automation (from my book The Design of Future Things) \nand what I consider the best new approach to deal with design \nso as to either eliminate or minimize human error: resilience \nengineering.\nChapter 6: Design Thinking\nThis chapter is completely new. I discuss two views of human-\ncentered design: the British Design Council’s double-diamond \nmodel and the traditional HCD iteration of observation, ide-\nation, prototyping, and testing. The first diamond is the diver-\ngence, followed by convergence, of possibilities to determine \nthe appropriate problem. The second diamond is a divergence-\nconvergence to determine an appropriate solution. I introduce \n",

These sections cover \nthe theory.\nThe chapter then takes a radical shift in position, starting with a \nsection entitled “What I Just Told You? It Doesn’t Really Work That \nWay.” Here is where I introduce Norman’s Law: The day the prod-\nuct team is announced, it is behind schedule and over its budget.\nI discuss challenges of design within a company, where sched-\nules, budgets, and the competing requirements of the different \ndivisions all provide severe constraints upon what can be accom-\nplished.

Here I discuss “featuritis,” \nthe changes being forced upon us through the invention of new \ntechnologies, and the distinction between incremental and radical \ninnovation. Everyone wants radical innovation, but the truth is, \nmost radical innovations fail, and even when they do succeed, it \ncan take multiple decades before they are accepted. Radical innova-\ntion, therefore, is relatively rare: incremental innovation is common.\nThe techniques of human-centered design are appropriate to in-\ncremental innovation: they cannot lead to radical innovations.\nThe chapter concludes with discussions of the trends to come, \nthe future of books, the moral obligations of design, and the rise of \nsmall, do-it-yourself makers that are starting to revolutionize the \nway ideas are conceived and introduced into the marketplace: \n“the rise of the small,” I call it.\nSummary\nWith the passage of time, the psychology of people stays the same, \nbut the tools and objects in the world change.

You come to a \ndoor. How does it open? Should you push or pull, on the left or the \nright? Maybe the door slides. If so, in which direction?

The entrance was an imposing row \nof six glass swinging doors, followed immediately by a second, \nidentical row. That’s a standard design: it helps reduce the airflow \nand thus maintain the indoor temperature of the building. There \nwas no visible hardware: obviously the doors could swing in ei-\nther direction: all a person had to do was push the side of the door \nand enter.\nMy friend pushed on one of the outer doors. It swung inward, \nand he entered the building. Then, before he could get to the next \nrow of doors, he was distracted and turned around for an instant. \nHe didn’t realize it at the time, but he had moved slightly to the \nright. So when he came to the next door and pushed it, nothing \nhappened. “Hmm,” he thought, “must be locked.” So he pushed \nthe side of the adjacent door. Nothing. Puzzled, my friend decided \nto go outside again. He turned around and pushed against the \nside of a door. Nothing. He pushed the adjacent door. Nothing. \nThe door he had just entered no longer worked. He turned around \nonce more and tried the inside doors again. Nothing. Concern, \nthen mild panic. He was trapped! Just then, a group of people on \nthe other side of the entranceway (to my friend’s right) passed eas-\nily through both sets of doors. My friend hurried over to follow \ntheir path.\nFIGURE 1.1.

A swinging door has two sides. \nOne contains the supporting pillar and the hinge, the other is un-\nsupported. To open the door, you must push or pull on the unsup-\nported edge. If you push on the hinge side, nothing happens. In \nmy friend’s case, he was in a building where the designer aimed \nfor beauty, not utility. No distracting lines, no visible pillars, no vis-\nible hinges. So how can the ordinary user know which side to push \non? While distracted, my friend had moved toward the (invisible) \nsupporting pillar, so he was pushing the doors on the hinged side. \nNo wonder nothing happened. Attractive doors. Stylish. Probably \nwon a design prize.\nTwo of the most important characteristics of good design are dis-\ncoverability and understanding. Discoverability: Is it possible to even \nfigure out what actions are possible and where and how to per-\nform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the \nproduct supposed to be used? What do all the different controls \nand settings mean?\nThe doors in the story illustrate what happens when discoverabil-\nity fails. Whether the device is a door or a stove, a mobile phone \nor a nuclear power plant, the relevant components must be visible, \nand they must communicate the correct message: What actions \nare possible? Where and how should they be done? With doors \nthat push, the designer must provide signals that naturally indi-\ncate where to push. These need not destroy the aesthetics. Put a \nvertical plate on the side to be pushed. Or make the supporting \npillars visible. The vertical plate and supporting pillars are natural \nsignals, naturally interpreted, making it easy to know just what to \ndo: no labels needed.\nWith complex devices, discoverability and understanding re-\nquire the aid of manuals or personal instruction. We accept this \nif the device is indeed complex, but it should be unnecessary for \nsimple things. Many products defy understanding simply because \nthey have too many functions and controls.

Moreover, many of the rules followed \nby a machine are known only by the machine and its designers.\nWhen people fail to follow these bizarre, secret rules, and the \nmachine does the wrong thing, its operators are blamed for not \nunderstanding the machine, for not following its rigid specifica-\ntions. With everyday objects, the result is frustration. With complex \ndevices and commercial and industrial processes, the resulting \ndifficulties can lead to accidents, injuries, and even deaths.

Those who have not \nstudied human behavior often think it is pretty simple. Engineers, \nmoreover, make the mistake of thinking that logical explanation is \nsufficient: “If only people would read the instructions,” they say, \n“everything would be all right.”\nEngineers are trained to think logically. As a result, they come to \nbelieve that all people must think this way, and they design their \nmachines accordingly. When people have trouble, the engineers \nare upset, but often for the wrong reason. “What are these people \ndoing?” they will wonder. “Why are they doing that?” The prob-\nlem with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. \nWe have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we \nwould wish it to be.\n",

So we must design our ma-\nchines on the assumption that people will make errors.

From the ever-increasing \ncomplexity of the automobile dashboard, to the increasing auto-\nmation in the home with its internal networks, complex music, \nvideo, and game systems for entertainment and communication, \nand the increasing automation in the kitchen, everyday life some-\ntimes seems like a never-ending fight against confusion, continued \nerrors, frustration, and a continual cycle of updating and maintain-\ning our belongings.\nIn the multiple decades that have elapsed since the first edition \nof this book was published, design has gotten better. There are now \nmany books and courses on the topic. But even though much has \nimproved, the rapid rate of technology change outpaces the ad-\nvances in design. New technologies, new applications, and new \nmethods of interaction are continually arising and evolving. New \nindustries spring up. Each new development seems to repeat the \nmistakes of the earlier ones; each new field requires time before \nit, too, adopts the principles of good design. And each new inven-\ntion of technology or interaction technique requires experimenta-\ntion and study before the principles of good design can be fully \nintegrated into practice. So, yes, things are getting better, but as a \nresult, the challenges are ever present.\nThe solution is human-centered design (HCD), an approach \nthat puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then de-\nsigns to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of be-\nhaving. Good design starts with an understanding of psychology \nand technology. Good design requires good communication, espe-\ncially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible, \nwhat is happening, and what is about to happen. Communica-\ntion is especially important when things go wrong. It is relatively \neasy to design things that work smoothly and harmoniously as \n",

This is where good design \nis essential. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases \nwhere things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned. \nActually, this is where the most satisfaction can arise: when some-\nthing goes wrong but the machine highlights the problems, then \nthe person understands the issue, takes the proper actions, and the \nproblem is solved. When this happens smoothly, the collaboration \nof person and device feels wonderful.\nHuman-centered design is a design philosophy. It means start-\ning with a good understanding of people and the needs that the \ndesign is intended to meet. This understanding comes about pri-\nmarily through observation, for people themselves are often un-\naware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are \nencountering. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined \nis one of the most difficult parts of the design, so much so that the \nHCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as pos-\nsible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations. This is \ndone through rapid tests of ideas, and after each test modifying the \napproach and the problem definition. The results can be products \nthat truly meet the needs of people. Doing HCD within the rigid \ntime, budget, and other constraints of industry can be a challenge: \nChapter 6 examines these issues.\nWhere does HCD fit into the earlier discussion of the several dif-\nferent forms of design, especially the areas called industrial, inter-\naction, and experience design?

Why is it that when we encounter many unusual natural \nobjects, we know how to interact with them? Why is this true with \nmany of the artificial, human-made objects we encounter? The an-\nswer lies with a few basic principles. Some of the most important \nof these principles come from a consideration of affordances.\nThe term affordance refers to the relationship between a physi-\ncal object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, \nwhether animal or human, or even machines and robots). An affor-\ndance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the \ncapabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could \npossibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore, \naffords sitting. Most chairs can also be carried by a single per-\nson (they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong \nperson or by a team of people. If young or relatively weak people \ncannot lift a chair, then for these people, the chair does not have \nthat affordance, it does not afford lifting.\nThe presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qual-\nities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting. \nThis relational definition of affordance gives considerable difficulty \nto many people. We are used to thinking that properties are asso-\nciated with objects. But affordance is not a property. An affordance \nis a relationship. Whether an affordance exists depends upon the \nproperties of both the object and the agent.\nGlass affords transparency. At the same time, its physical struc-\nture blocks the passage of most physical objects. As a result, glass \naffords seeing through and support, but not the passage of air or \nmost physical objects (atomic particles can pass through glass). \nThe blockage of passage can be considered an anti-affordance—the \nprevention of interaction. To be effective, affordances and anti-\naffordances have to be discoverable—perceivable. This poses a \ndifficulty with glass. The reason we like glass is its relative invis-\nibility, but this aspect, so useful in the normal window, also hides \nits anti-affordance property of blocking passage. As a result, birds \noften try to fly through windows. And every year, numerous peo-\nple injure themselves when they walk (or run) through closed glass \n",

If an affordance or anti-affordance \ncannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is re-\nquired: I call this property a signifier (discussed in the next section).\nThe notion of affordance and the insights it provides originated \nwith J. J. Gibson, an eminent psychologist who provided many \nadvances to our understanding of human perception. I had in-\nteracted with him over many years, sometimes in formal confer-\nences and seminars, but most fruitfully over many bottles of beer, \nlate at night, just talking. We disagreed about almost everything. \nI was an engineer who became a cognitive psychologist, trying to \nunderstand how the mind works. He started off as a Gestalt psy-\nchologist, but then developed an approach that is today named \nafter him: Gibsonian psychology, an ecological approach to percep-\ntion. He argued that the world contained the clues and that people \nsimply picked them up through “direct perception.” I argued that \nnothing could be direct: the brain had to process the information \narriving at the sense organs to put together a coherent interpreta-\ntion. “Nonsense,” he loudly proclaimed; “it requires no interpreta-\ntion: it is directly perceived.” And then he would put his hand to \nhis ears, and with a triumphant flourish, turn off his hearing aids: \nmy counterarguments would fall upon deaf ears—literally.\nWhen I pondered my question—how do people know how to act \nwhen confronted with a novel situation—I realized that a large \npart of the answer lay in Gibson’s work. He pointed out that all the \nsenses work together, that we pick up information about the world \nby the combined result of all of them. “Information pickup” was one \nof his favorite phrases, and Gibson believed that the combined in-\nformation picked up by all of our sensory apparatus—sight, sound, \nsmell, touch, balance, kinesthetic, acceleration, body position—\ndetermines our perceptions without the need for internal pro-\ncessing or cognition. Although he and I disagreed about the role \nplayed by the brain’s internal processing, his brilliance was in fo-\ncusing attention on the rich amount of information present in the \nworld. Moreover, the physical objects conveyed important infor-\nmation about how people could interact with them, a property he \nnamed “affordance.”\n",

For designers, their \nvisibility is critical: visible affordances provide strong clues to the \noperations of things. A flat plate mounted on a door affords push-\ning. Knobs afford turning, pushing, and pulling. Slots are for in-\nserting things into. Balls are for throwing or bouncing. Perceived \naffordances help people figure out what actions are possible with-\nout the need for labels or instructions. I call the signaling compo-\nnent of affordances signifiers.\nSIGNIFIERS\nAre affordances important to designers? The first edition of this \nbook introduced the term affordances to the world of design. The \ndesign community loved the concept and affordances soon prop-\nagated into the instruction and writing about design. I soon found \nmention of the term everywhere. Alas, the term became used in \nways that had nothing to do with the original.\nMany people find affordances difficult to understand because \nthey are relationships, not properties. Designers deal with fixed \nproperties, so there is a temptation to say that the property is an \naffordance. But that is not the only problem with the concept of \naffordances.\nDesigners have practical problems. They need to know how to \ndesign things to make them understandable. They soon discov-\nered that when working with the graphical designs for electronic \ndisplays, they needed a way to designate which parts could be \ntouched, slid upward, downward, or sideways, or tapped upon. \nThe actions could be done with a mouse, stylus, or fingers. Some \nsystems responded to body motions, gestures, and spoken words, \nwith no touching of any physical device. How could designers de-\nscribe what they were doing? There was no word that fit, so they \ntook the closest existing word—affordance.

That’s not the same thing \nas saying what action is possible.”\nNot only did my explanation fail to satisfy the design commu-\nnity, but I myself was unhappy. Eventually I gave up: designers \nneeded a word to describe what they were doing, so they chose \naffordance. What alternative did they have? I decided to provide a \nbetter answer: signifiers. Affordances determine what actions are \npossible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. \nWe need both.\nPeople need some way of understanding the product or service \nthey wish to use, some sign of what it is for, what is happening, \nand what the alternative actions are. People search for clues, for \nany sign that might help them cope and understand. It is the sign \nthat is important, anything that might signify meaningful informa-\ntion. Designers need to provide these clues. What people need, and \nwhat designers must provide, are signifiers. Good design requires, \namong other things, good communication of the purpose, struc-\nture, and operation of the device to the people who use it. That is \nthe role of the signifier.\nThe term signifier has had a long and illustrious career in the ex-\notic field of semiotics, the study of signs and symbols. But just as \nI appropriated affordance to use in design in a manner somewhat \ndifferent than its inventor had intended, I use signifier in a some-\nwhat different way than it is used in semiotics. For me, the term \nsignifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that \ncommunicates appropriate behavior to a person.\nSignifiers can be deliberate and intentional, such as the sign \npush on a door, but they may also be accidental and unintentional, \nsuch as our use of the visible trail made by previous people walk-\ning through a field or over a snow-covered terrain to determine \nthe best path. Or how we might use the presence or absence of \npeople waiting at a train station to determine whether we have \nmissed the train.

Signifiers \nare signals. Some signifiers are signs, labels, and drawings placed \nin the world, such as the signs labeled “push,” “pull,” or “exit” \non doors, or arrows and diagrams indicating what is to be acted \nupon or in which direction to gesture, or other instructions. Some \nsignifiers are simply the perceived affordances, such as the han-\ndle of a door or the physical structure of a switch. Note that some \nperceived affordances may not be real: they may look like doors \nor places to push, or an impediment to entry, when in fact they \nare not. These are misleading signifiers, oftentimes accidental but \nsometimes purposeful, as when trying to keep people from doing \nactions for which they are not qualified, or in games, where one of \nthe challenges is to figure out what is real and what is not.\nFIGURE 1.5.

But to my great \nsurprise, I saw a park vehicle simply go through the pipes. Huh? I \nwalked over and examined them: the pipes were made of rubber, \nso vehicles could simply drive right over them. A very clever sig-\nnifier, signaling a blocked road (via an apparent anti-affordance) \nto the average person, but permitting passage for those who knew.\nTo summarize:\n• Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the en-\nvironment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.\n• Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.\n• Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and \nhow they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they \nfail to function.\nIn design, signifiers are more important than affordances, for \nthey communicate how to use the design. A signifier can be words, \na graphical illustration, or just a device whose perceived affor-\ndances are unambiguous. Creative designers incorporate the sig-\nnifying part of the design into a cohesive experience. For the most \npart, designers can focus upon signifiers.\nBecause affordances and signifiers are fundamentally important \nprinciples of good design, they show up frequently in the pages of \nthis book.

The mapping of switches to lights specifies which switch \ncontrols which light.\nMapping is an important concept in the design and layout of \ncontrols and displays. When the mapping uses spatial correspon-\ndence between the layout of the controls and the devices being \ncontrolled, it is easy to determine how to use them. In steering a \ncar, we rotate the steering wheel clockwise to cause the car to turn \nright: the top of the wheel moves in the same direction as the car. \nNote that other choices could have been made. In early cars, steer-\ning was controlled by a variety of devices, including tillers, han-\ndlebars, and reins. Today, some vehicles use joysticks, much as in a \ncomputer game. In cars that used tillers, steering was done much \nas one steers a boat: move the tiller to the left to turn to the right. \nTractors, construction equipment such as bulldozers and cranes, \nand military tanks that have tracks instead of wheels use separate \ncontrols for the speed and direction of each track: to turn right, the \nleft track is increased in speed, while the right track is slowed or \neven reversed. This is also how a wheelchair is steered.\nAll of these mappings for the control of vehicles work because \neach has a compelling conceptual model of how the operation of \nthe control affects the vehicle. Thus, if we speed up the left wheel \nof a wheelchair while stopping the right wheel, it is easy to imag-\nine the chair’s pivoting on the right wheel, circling to the right. In \nFIGURE 1.6.

It doesn’t \nmatter whether these conceptual models are accurate: what mat-\nters is that they provide a clear way of remembering and under-\nstanding the mappings. The relationship between a control and \nits results is easiest to learn wherever there is an understandable \nmapping between the controls, the actions, and the intended result.\nNatural mapping, by which I mean taking advantage of spatial \nanalogies, leads to immediate understanding. For example, to move \nan object up, move the control up. To make it easy to determine \nwhich control works which light in a large room or auditorium, \narrange the controls in the same pattern as the lights. Some natural \nmappings are cultural or biological, as in the universal standard \nthat moving the hand up signifies more, moving it down signifies \nless, which is why it is appropriate to use vertical position to rep-\nresent intensity or amount. Other natural mappings follow from \nthe principles of perception and allow for the natural grouping or \npatterning of controls and feedback.

Ever \ndrive to a traffic intersection and wait an inordinate amount of \ntime for the signals to change, wondering all the time whether the \ndetection circuits noticed your vehicle (a common problem with \nbicycles)?

Even as simple a task as picking up a glass with the hand re-\nquires feedback to aim the hand properly, to grasp the glass, and to  \nlift it. A misplaced hand will spill the contents, too hard a grip will \nbreak the glass, and too weak a grip will allow it to fall.

If the delay is too long, people often give up, \ngoing off to do other activities. This is annoying to the people, but \nit can also be wasteful of resources when the system spends con-\nsiderable time and effort to satisfy the request, only to find that the \nintended recipient is no longer there.

Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback \nat all, because it is distracting, uninformative, and in many cases \nirritating and anxiety-provoking.\nToo much feedback can be even more annoying than too little. \nMy dishwasher likes to beep at three a.m. to tell me that the wash \nis done, defeating my goal of having it work in the middle of the \nnight so as not to disturb anyone (and to use less expensive elec-\ntricity).

Without a good model, we op-\nerate by rote, blindly; we do operations as we were told to do them; \nwe can’t fully appreciate why, what effects to expect, or what to do \nif things go wrong. As long as things work properly, we can manage. \nWhen things go wrong, however, or when we come upon a novel \nsituation, then we need a deeper understanding, a good model.\nFor everyday things, conceptual models need not be very com-\nplex. After all, scissors, pens, and light switches are pretty simple \ndevices. There is no need to understand the underlying physics or \nchemistry of each device we own, just the relationship between \nthe controls and the outcomes. When the model presented to us is \ninadequate or wrong (or, worse, nonexistent), we can have difficul-\nties. Let me tell you about my refrigerator.\nI used to own an ordinary, two-compartment refrigerator—nothing \nvery fancy about it. The problem was that I couldn’t set the tem-\nperature properly. There were only two things to do: adjust the \ntemperature of the freezer compartment and adjust the tempera-\nFIGURE 1.9. Refrigerator Controls.

And there were two controls, \none labeled “freezer,” the other “refrigerator.” What’s the problem?\nOh, perhaps I’d better warn you. The two controls are not inde-\npendent. The freezer control also affects the fresh food tempera-\nture, and the fresh food control also affects the freezer. Moreover, \nthe manual warns that one should “always allow twenty-four (24) \nhours for the temperature to stabilize whether setting the controls \nfor the first time or making an adjustment.”\nIt was extremely difficult to regulate the temperature of my old \nrefrigerator. Why? Because the controls suggest a false conceptual \nmodel. Two compartments, two controls, which implies that each \ncontrol is responsible for the temperature of the compartment that \ncarries its name: this conceptual model is shown in Figure 1.10A. It \nis wrong. In fact, there is only one thermostat and only one cooling \nmechanism. One control adjusts the thermostat setting, the other \nthe relative proportion of cold air sent to each of the two compart-\nments of the refrigerator. This is why the two controls interact: this \nconceptual model is shown in Figure 1.10B. In addition, there must \nbe a temperature sensor, but there is no way of knowing where it \nis located. With the conceptual model suggested by the controls, \nFIGURE 1.10. Two Conceptual Models for a Refrigerator. The conceptual model \nA is provided by the system image of the refrigerator as gleaned from the controls. \nEach control determines the temperature of the named part of the refrigerator. This \nmeans that each compartment has its own temperature sensor and cooling unit. This is \nwrong. The correct conceptual model is shown in B. There is no way of knowing where \nthe temperature sensor is located so it is shown outside the refrigerator. The freezer \ncontrol determines the freezer temperature (so is this where the sensor is located?). \nThe refrigerator control determines how much of the cold air goes to the freezer and \nhow much to the refrigerator.\nA.\nB.\n",

Given the correct model, life would be much easier.\nWhy did the manufacturer suggest the wrong conceptual model? \nWe will never know. In the twenty-five years since the publication \nof the first edition of this book, I have had many letters from people \nthanking me for explaining their confusing refrigerator, but never \nany communication from the manufacturer (General Electric). Per-\nhaps the designers thought the correct model was too complex, \nthat the model they were giving was easier to understand. But with \nthe wrong conceptual model, it was impossible to set the controls. \nAnd even though I am convinced I knew the correct model, I still \ncouldn’t accurately adjust the temperatures because the refrigera-\ntor design made it impossible to discover which control was for the \ntemperature sensor, which for the relative proportion of cold air, \nand in which compartment the sensor was located. The lack of im-\nmediate feedback for the actions did not help: it took twenty-four \nhours to see whether the new setting was appropriate.

In-\nstead I have one that has two separate controls, one in the fresh \nfood compartment, one in the freezer compartment. Each control \nis nicely calibrated in degrees and labeled with the name of the \ncompartment it controls. The two compartments are independent: \nsetting the temperature in one has no effect on the temperature in \nthe other. This solution, although ideal, does cost more. But far less \nexpensive solutions are possible. With today’s inexpensive sensors \nand motors, it should be possible to have a single cooling unit with \na motor-controlled valve controlling the relative proportion of cold \nair diverted to each compartment. A simple, inexpensive computer \nchip could regulate the cooling unit and valve position so that the \ntemperatures in the two compartments match their targets. A bit \nmore work for the engineering design team? Yes, but the results \nwould be worth it.

The photograph in Figure 1.9 is from a contemporary \nrefrigerator, photographed in a store while preparing this book.\nThe System Image\nPeople create mental models of themselves, others, the environ-\nment, and the things with which they interact. These are concep-\ntual models formed through experience, training, and instruction. \nThese models serve as guides to help achieve our goals and in un-\nderstanding the world.\nHow do we form an appropriate conceptual model for the de-\nvices we interact with? We cannot talk to the designer, so we rely \nupon whatever information is available to us: what the device \nlooks like, what we know from using similar things in the past, \nwhat was told to us in the sales literature, by salespeople and ad-\nvertisements, by articles we may have read, by the product website \nand instruction manuals. I call the combined information available \nto us the system image. When the system image is incoherent or in-\nappropriate, as in the case of the refrigerator, then the user cannot \neasily use the device. If it is incomplete or contradictory, there will \nbe trouble.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1.11, the designer of the product and the \nperson using the product form somewhat disconnected vertices of \na triangle. The designer’s conceptual model is the designer’s con-\nception of the product, occupying one vertex of the triangle. The \nproduct itself is no longer with the designer, so it is isolated as a \nsecond vertex, perhaps sitting on the user’s kitchen counter. The \nsystem image is what can be perceived from the physical struc-\nture that has been built (including documentation, instructions, \nsignifiers, and any information available from websites and help \nlines). The user’s conceptual model comes from the system image, \nthrough interaction with the product, reading, searching for online \ninformation, and from whatever manuals are provided. The de-\nsigner expects the user’s model to be identical to the design model, \nbut because designers cannot communicate directly with users, the \nentire burden of communication is on the system image.\n",

Turning the knob would wind the spring \nthat provided power to the watch movement. Pulling out the knob \nand turning it rotated the hands. The operations were easy to learn \nand easy to do.

In its normal position, \nturning the stem wound the mainspring of the clock. The stem had \nto be pulled before it would engage the gears for setting the time. \nAccidental turns of the stem did no harm.\nWatches in olden times were expensive instruments, manu-\nfactured by hand. They were sold in jewelry stores. Over time, \nwith the introduction of digital technology, the cost of watches \ndecreased rapidly, while their accuracy and reliability increased. \nWatches became tools, available in a wide variety of styles and \nshapes and with an ever-increasing number of functions. Watches \nwere sold everywhere, from local shops to sporting goods stores \nto electronic stores. Moreover, accurate clocks were incorporated in \nmany appliances, from phones to musical keyboards: many people \nno longer felt the need to wear a watch. Watches became inexpen-\nsive enough that the average person could own multiple watches. \nThey became fashion accessories, where one changed the watch \nwith each change in activity and each change of clothes.\nIn the modern digital watch, instead of winding the spring, we \nchange the battery, or in the case of a solar-powered watch, ensure \nthat it gets its weekly dose of light. The technology has allowed \nmore functions: the watch can give the day of the week, the month, \nand the year; it can act as a stopwatch (which itself has several \nfunctions), a countdown timer, and an alarm clock (or two); it has \nthe ability to show the time for different time zones; it can act as \na counter and even as a calculator. My watch, shown in Figure \n1.8, has many functions. It even has a radio receiver to allow it to \nset its time with official time stations around the world. Even so, \nit is far less complex than many that are available. Some watches \nhave built-in compasses and barometers, accelerometers, and tem-\nperature gauges. Some have GPS and Internet receivers so they \ncan display the weather and news, e-mail messages, and the lat-\nest from social networks. Some have built-in cameras. Some work \nwith buttons, knobs, motion, or speech. Some detect gestures. The \nwatch is no longer just an instrument for telling time: it has become \na platform for enhancing multiple activities and lifestyles.\n",

A cell phone performs all the functions \nmuch better than the tiny watch, while also displaying the time.\nNow imagine a future where instead of the phone replacing \nthe watch, the two will merge, perhaps worn on the wrist, per-\nhaps on the head like glasses, complete with display screen.

One day, our landlady returned to the house \nto get some personal papers. She walked over to the old, metal filing \ncabinet and attempted to open the top drawer. It wouldn’t open. She \npushed it forward and backward, right and left, up and down, without \nsuccess. I offered to help. I wiggled the drawer. Then I twisted the front \npanel, pushed down hard, and banged the front with the palm of one \nhand. The cabinet drawer slid open. “Oh,” she said, “I’m sorry.

But she also had a \nsecond problem: she thought the problem lay in her own lack of \nability: she blamed herself, falsely.\nHow was I able to help? First, I refused to accept the false accu-\nsation that it was the fault of the landlady: to me, it was clearly a \nfault in the mechanics of the old filing cabinet that prevented the \ndrawer from opening. Second, I had a conceptual model of how \nthe cabinet worked, with an internal mechanism that held the door \nshut in normal usage, and the belief that the drawer mechanism \nwas probably out of alignment.

This felt good to me—the cabinet drawer \nmoved slightly—but it still didn’t open. So I resorted to the most \npowerful tool employed by experts the world around—I banged \non the cabinet. And yes, it opened. In my mind, I decided (without \nany evidence) that my hit had jarred the mechanism sufficiently to \nallow the drawer to open.\nThis example highlights the themes of this chapter. First, how do \npeople do things? It is easy to learn a few basic steps to perform \noperations with our technologies (and yes, even filing cabinets are \ntechnology). But what happens when things go wrong? How do \nwe detect that they aren’t working, and then how do we know \nwhat to do? To help understand this, I first delve into human psy-\nchology and a simple conceptual model of how people select and \nthen evaluate their actions. This leads the discussion to the role of \nunderstanding (via a conceptual model) and of emotions: pleasure \nwhen things work smoothly and frustration when our plans are \nthwarted. Finally, I conclude with a summary of how the lessons \nof this chapter translate into principles of design.\nHow People Do Things: \nThe Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation\nWhen people use something, they face two gulfs: the Gulf of Exe-\ncution, where they try to figure out how it operates, and the Gulf \nof Evaluation, where they try to figure out what happened (Fig-\nure 2.1). The role of the designer is to help people bridge the \ntwo gulfs.\nIn the case of the filing cabinet, there were visible elements that \nhelped bridge the Gulf of Execution when everything was work-\ning perfectly. The drawer handle clearly signified that it should be \npulled and the slider on the handle indicated how to release the \ncatch that normally held the drawer in place. But when these oper-\nations failed, there then loomed a big gulf: what other operations \ncould be done to open the drawer?\n",

But when other \noperations were tried, such \nas my twisting and pull-\ning, the filing cabinet pro-\nvided no more information \nabout whether I was get-\nting closer to the goal.\nThe Gulf of Evaluation \nreflects the amount of ef-\nfort that the person must \nmake to interpret the phys-\nical state of the device and to determine how well the expectations \nand intentions have been met. The gulf is small when the device \nprovides information about its state in a form that is easy to get, \nis easy to interpret, and matches the way the person thinks about \nthe system.

Interestingly, many peo-\nple do experience difficulties, but explain them away by blaming \nthemselves. In the case of things they believe they should be capa-\nble of using—water faucets, refrigerator temperature controls, stove \ntops—they simply think, “I’m being stupid.” Alternatively, for com-\nplicated-looking devices—sewing machines, washing machines, \ndigital watches, or almost any digital controls—they simply give up, \ndeciding that they are incapable of understanding them. Both expla-\nnations are wrong. These are the things of everyday household use. \nNone of them has a complex underlying structure.

But the basic tools have already been discussed: \nWe bridge the Gulf of Execution through the use of signifiers, con-\nstraints, mappings, and a conceptual model. We bridge the Gulf of \nEvaluation through the use of feedback and a conceptual model.\nThe Seven Stages of Action\nThere are two parts to an action: executing the action and then \nevaluating the results: doing and interpreting. Both execution and \nevaluation require understanding: how the item works and what \nresults it produces. Both execution and evaluation can affect our \nemotional state.\nSuppose I am sitting in my armchair, reading a book. It is dusk, \nand the light is getting dimmer and dimmer. My current activity \nis reading, but that goal is starting to fail because of the decreasing \nillumination. This realization triggers a new goal: get more light. \nHow do I do that? I have many choices. I could open the curtains, \nmove so that I sit where there is more light, or perhaps turn on a \nnearby light. This is the planning stage, determining which of the \nmany possible plans of action to follow. But even when I decide \nto turn on the nearby light, I still have to determine how to get it \ndone. I could ask someone to do it for me, I could use my left hand \nor my right. Even after I have decided upon a plan, I still have to \nspecify how I will do it. Finally, I must execute—do—the action. \nWhen I am doing a frequent act, one for which I am quite experi-\nenced and skilled, most of these stages are subconscious. When I \nam still learning how to do it, determining the plan, specifying the \nsequence, and interpreting the result are conscious.\nSuppose I am driving in my car and my action plan requires me \nto make a left turn at a street intersection. If I am a skilled driver, \nI don’t have to give much conscious attention to specify or per-\nform the action sequence. I think “left” and smoothly execute the \nrequired action sequence. But if I am just learning to drive, I have \nto think about each separate component of the action. I must ap-\nply the brakes and check for cars behind and around me, cars and \n",

There are multiple feedback loops \nin which the results of one activity are used to direct further ones, in \nwhich goals lead to subgoals, and plans lead to subplans. There are \nactivities in which goals are forgotten, discarded, or reformulated.\nLet’s go back to my act of turning on the light. This is a case of \nevent-driven behavior: the sequence starts with the world, caus-\ning evaluation of the state and the formulation of a goal. The trig-\nger was an environmental event: the lack of light, which made \nreading difficult. This led to a violation of the goal of reading, so \nit led to a subgoal—get more light. But reading was not the high-\nlevel goal. For each goal, one has to ask, “Why is that the goal?” \nWhy was I reading? I was trying to prepare a meal using a new \nrecipe, so I needed to reread it before I started. Reading was thus \na subgoal. But cooking was itself a subgoal. I was cooking in or-\nder to eat, which had the goal of satisfying my hunger. So the \nhierarchy of goals is roughly: satisfy hunger; eat; cook; read cook-\nbook; get more light. This is called a root cause analysis: asking \n“Why?” until the ultimate, fundamental cause of the activity is \nreached.\nThe action cycle can start from the top, by establishing a new \ngoal, in which case we call it goal-driven behavior. In this situ-\nation, the cycle starts with the goal and then goes through the \nthree stages of execution. But the action cycle can also start from \nthe bottom, triggered by some event in the world, in which case we \n",

In this situation, \nthe cycle starts with the environment, the world, and then goes \nthrough the three stages of evaluation.\nFor many everyday tasks, goals and intentions are not well spec-\nified: they are opportunistic rather than planned. Opportunistic \nactions are those in which the behavior takes advantage of circum-\nstances. Rather than engage in extensive planning and analysis, we \ngo about the day’s activities and do things as opportunities arise. \nThus, we may not have planned to try a new café or to ask a question \nof a friend. Rather, we go through the day’s activities, and if we find \nourselves near the café or encountering the friend, then we allow the \nopportunity to trigger the appropriate activity. Otherwise, we might \nnever get to that café or ask our friend the question. For crucial \ntasks we make special efforts to ensure that they get done. Oppor-\ntunistic actions are less precise and certain than specified goals and \nintentions, but they result in less mental effort, less inconvenience, \nand perhaps more interest. Some of us adjust our lives around the \nexpectation of opportunities. And sometimes, even for goal-driven \nbehavior, we try to create world events that will ensure that the \nsequence gets completed. For example, sometimes when I must do \nan important task, I ask someone to set a deadline for me. I use the \napproach of that deadline to trigger the work. It may only be a few \nhours before the deadline that I actually get to work and do the job, \nbut the important point is that it does get done. This self-triggering \nof external drivers is fully compatible with the seven-stage analysis.\nThe seven stages provide a guideline for developing new prod-\nucts or services. The gulfs are obvious places to start, for either gulf, \nwhether of execution or evaluation, is an opportunity for product \nenhancement. The trick is to develop observational skills to detect \nthem. Most innovation is done as an incremental enhancement of \nexisting products. What about radical ideas, ones that introduce \nnew product categories to the marketplace? These come about by \nreconsidering the goals, and always asking what the real goal is: \nwhat is called the root cause analysis.\nHarvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt \nonce pointed out, “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. \n",

That is why it is useful to consider the \nseven stages of action. The mind is more difficult to comprehend \nthan actions. Most of us start by believing we already understand \nboth human behavior and the human mind. After all, we are all hu-\nman: we have all lived with ourselves all of our lives, and we like \nto think we understand ourselves. But the truth is, we don’t. Most \nof human behavior is a result of subconscious processes. We are \nunaware of them. As a result, many of our beliefs about how peo-\nple behave—including beliefs about ourselves—are wrong. That is \nwhy we have the multiple social and behavioral sciences, with a \ngood dash of mathematics, economics, computer science, informa-\ntion science, and neuroscience.\nConsider the following simple experiment.

This is some-\ntimes referred to as “the lizard brain.” All people have the same ba-\nsic visceral responses. These are part of the basic protective mech-\nanisms of the human affective system, making quick judgments \nabout the environment: good or bad, safe or dangerous. The visceral \nsystem allows us to respond quickly and subconsciously, without \nconscious awareness or control. \nThe basic biology of the visceral \nsystem minimizes its ability to \nlearn. Visceral learning takes \nplace primarily by sensitization \nor desensitization through such \nmechanisms as adaptation and \nclassical conditioning. Visceral \nresponses are fast and automatic. \nThey give rise to the startle reflex \nfor novel, unexpected events; for \nsuch genetically programmed \nbehavior as fear of heights, dis-\nlike of the dark or very noisy \nenvironments, dislike of bitter \ntastes and the liking of sweet tastes, and so on. Note that the visceral \nlevel responds to the immediate present and produces an affective \nstate, relatively unaffected by context or history. It simply assesses \nthe situation: no cause is assigned, no blame, and no credit.\nThe visceral level is tightly coupled to the body’s musculature—\nthe motor system. This is what causes animals to fight or flee, or to \nrelax. An animal’s (or person’s) visceral state can often be read by \nanalyzing the tension of the body: tense means a negative state; re-\nlaxed, a positive state. Note, too, that we often determine our own \nbody state by noting our own musculature. A common self-report \nFIGURE 2.3. Three Levels of Process-\ning: Visceral, Behavioral, and Reflective. \nVisceral and behavioral levels are subcon-\nscious and the home of basic emotions. \nThe reflective level is where conscious \nthought and decision-making reside, as \nwell as the highest level of emotions.\n",

They \nare sensitive only to the current state of things. Most scientists do \nnot call these emotions: they are precursors to emotion. Stand at \nthe edge of a cliff and you will experience a visceral response. Or \nbask in the warm, comforting glow after a pleasant experience, \nperhaps a nice meal.\nFor designers, the visceral response is about immediate per-\nception: the pleasantness of a mellow, harmonious sound or the \njarring, irritating scratch of fingernails on a rough surface. Here \nis where the style matters: appearances, whether sound or sight, \ntouch or smell, drive the visceral response. This has nothing to do \nwith how usable, effective, or understandable the product is. It is \nall about attraction or repulsion. Great designers use their aesthetic \nsensibilities to drive these visceral responses.\nEngineers and other logical people tend to dismiss the visceral \nresponse as irrelevant. Engineers are proud of the inherent qual-\nity of their work and dismayed when inferior products sell better \n“just because they look better.” But all of us make these kinds of \njudgments, even those very logical engineers. That’s why they love \nsome of their tools and dislike others. Visceral responses matter.\nTHE BEHAVIORAL LEVEL\nThe behavioral level is the home of learned skills, triggered by sit-\nuations that match the appropriate patterns. Actions and analyses \nat this level are largely subconscious. Even though we are usually \naware of our actions, we are often unaware of the details. When we \nspeak, we often do not know what we are about to say until our \nconscious mind (the reflective part of the mind) hears ourselves \nuttering the words. When we play a sport, we are prepared for ac-\ntion, but our responses occur far too quickly for conscious control: \nit is the behavioral level that takes control.\nWhen we perform a well-learned action, all we have to do is \nthink of the goal and the behavioral level handles all the details: \nthe conscious mind has little or no awareness beyond creating the \n",

Stick out your tongue, or open your mouth. \nWhat did you do? You don’t know. All you know is that you \n“willed” the action and the correct thing happened. You can even \nmake the actions more complex. Pick up a cup, and then with the \nsame hand, pick up several more items. You automatically adjust \nthe fingers and the hand’s orientation to make the task possible. \nYou only need to pay conscious attention if the cup holds some liq-\nuid that you wish to avoid spilling. But even in that case, the actual \ncontrol of the muscles is beneath conscious perception: concentrate \non not spilling and the hands automatically adjust.\nFor designers, the most critical aspect of the behavioral level is \nthat every action is associated with an expectation. Expect a positive \noutcome and the result is a positive affective response (a “posi-\ntive valence,” in the scientific literature). Expect a negative outcome \nand the result is a negative affective response (a negative valence): \ndread and hope, anxiety and anticipation. The information in the \nfeedback loop of evaluation confirms or disconfirms the expecta-\ntions, resulting in satisfaction or relief, disappointment or frustration.\nBehavioral states are learned. They give rise to a feeling of con-\ntrol when there is good understanding and knowledge of results, \nand frustration and anger when things do not go as planned, and \nespecially when neither the reason nor the possible remedies are \nknown. Feedback provides reassurance, even when it indicates a \nnegative result. A lack of feedback creates a feeling of lack of con-\ntrol, which can be unsettling. Feedback is critical to managing ex-\npectations, and good design provides this. Feedback—knowledge \nof results—is how expectations are resolved and is critical to learn-\ning and the development of skilled behavior.\nExpectations play an important role in our emotional lives. This \nis why drivers tense when trying to get through an intersection be-\nfore the light turns red, or students become highly anxious before \nan exam. The release of the tension of expectation creates a sense of \nrelief.

As a conse-\nquence, this is where deep understanding develops, where reason-\ning and conscious decision-making take place. The visceral and \nbehavioral levels are subconscious and, as a result, they respond \nrapidly, but without much analysis. Reflection is cognitive, deep, \nand slow. It often occurs after the events have happened. It is a re-\nflection or looking back over them, evaluating the circumstances, \nactions, and outcomes, often assessing blame or responsibility. The \nhighest levels of emotions come from the reflective level, for it is \nhere that causes are assigned and where predictions of the future \ntake place. Adding causal elements to experienced events leads to \nsuch emotional states as guilt and pride (when we assume our-\nselves to be the cause) and blame and praise (when others are \nthought to be the cause). Most of us have probably experienced the \nextreme highs and lows of anticipated future events, all imagined \nby a runaway reflective cognitive system but intense enough to \ncreate the physiological responses associated with extreme anger \nor pleasure. Emotion and cognition are tightly intertwined.\nDESIGN MUST TAKE PLACE AT ALL LEVELS: \nVISCERAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND REFLECTIVE\nTo the designer, reflection is perhaps the most important of the \nlevels of processing. Reflection is conscious, and the emotions \nproduced at this level are the most protracted: those that assign \nagency and cause, such as guilt and blame or praise and pride. Re-\nflective responses are part of our memory of events. Memories last \nfar longer than the immediate experience or the period of usage, \nwhich are the domains of the visceral and behavioral levels. It is \nreflection that drives us to recommend a product, to recommend \nthat others use it—or perhaps to avoid it.\nReflective memories are often more important than reality.

Similarly, too much frustration, especially toward the ending \nstage of use, and our reflections about the experience might over-\nlook the positive visceral qualities. Advertisers hope that the strong \nreflective value associated with a well-known, highly prestigious \nbrand might overwhelm our judgment, despite a frustrating expe-\nrience in using the product. Vacations are often remembered with \nfondness, despite the evidence from diaries of repeated discomfort \nand anguish.\nAll three levels of processing work together. All play essential \nroles in determining a person’s like or dislike of a product or ser-\nvice. One nasty experience with a service provider can spoil all \nfuture experiences. One superb experience can make up for past \ndeficiencies. The behavioral level, which is the home of interaction, \nis also the home of all expectation-based emotions, of hope and joy, \nfrustration and anger. Understanding arises at a combination of \nthe behavioral and reflective levels. Enjoyment requires all three. \nDesigning at all three levels is so important that I devote an entire \nbook to the topic, Emotional Design.\nIn psychology, there has been a long debate about which hap-\npens first: emotion or cognition. Do we run and flee because some \nevent happened that made us afraid? Or are we afraid because \nour conscious, reflective mind notices that we are running? The \nthree-level analysis shows that both of these ideas can be correct. \nSometimes the emotion comes first. An unexpected loud noise can \ncause automatic visceral and behavioral responses that make us \nflee. Then, the reflective system observes itself fleeing and deduces \nthat it is afraid. The actions of running and fleeing occur first and \nset off the interpretation of fear.\nBut sometimes cognition occurs first. Suppose the street where \nwe are walking leads to a dark and narrow section. Our reflective \nsystem might conjure numerous imagined threats that await us. \nAt some point, the imagined depiction of potential harm is large \n",

Here is where the cognition sets off the fear and the action.\nMost products do not cause fear, running, or fleeing, but badly \ndesigned devices can induce frustration and anger, a feeling of \nhelplessness and despair, and possibly even hate. Well-designed \ndevices can induce pride and enjoyment, a feeling of being in con-\ntrol and pleasure—possibly even love and attachment. Amuse-\nment parks are experts at balancing the conflicting responses of \nthe emotional stages, providing rides and fun houses that trigger \nfear responses from the visceral and behavioral levels, while all \nthe time providing reassurance at the reflective level that the park \nwould never subject anyone to real danger.\nAll three levels of processing work together to determine a per-\nson’s cognitive and emotional state. High-level reflective cognition \ncan trigger lower-level emotions. Lower-level emotions can trigger \nhigher-level reflective cognition.\nThe Seven Stages of Action \nand the Three Levels of Processing\nThe stages of action can readily be associated with the three differ-\nent levels of processing, as shown in Figure 2.4. At the lowest level \nare the visceral levels of calmness or anxiety when approaching a \ntask or evaluating the state of the world. Then, in the middle level, \nare the behavioral ones driven by expectations on the execution \nside—for example, hope and fear—and emotions driven by the \nconfirmation of those expectations on the evaluation side—for ex-\nample, relief or despair.

That is one reason storytelling is such \na persuasive medium. Stories resonate with our experiences and \nprovide examples of new instances. From our experiences and the \nstories of others we tend to form generalizations about the way \npeople behave and things work. We attribute causes to events, and \nas long as these cause-and-effect pairings make sense, we accept \nthem and use them for understanding future events. Yet these \ncausal attributions are often erroneous. Sometimes they implicate \nthe wrong causes, and for some things that happen, there is no \nsingle cause; rather, a complex chain of events that all contribute \nto the result: if any one of the events would not have occurred, the \nresult would be different. But even when there is no single causal \nact, that doesn’t stop people from assigning one. \nConceptual models are a form of story, resulting from our predis-\nposition to find explanations. These models are essential in helping \nus understand our experiences, predict the outcome of our actions, \nand handle unexpected occurrences. We base our models on what-\never knowledge we have, real or imaginary, naive or sophisticated.\nConceptual models are often constructed from fragmentary evi-\ndence, with only a poor understanding of what is happening, and \nwith a kind of naive psychology that postulates causes, mecha-\nnisms, and relationships even where there are none. Some faulty \nmodels lead to the frustrations of everyday life, as in the case of my \nunsettable refrigerator, where my conceptual model of its opera-\ntion (see again Figure 1.10A) did not correspond to reality (Figure \n1.10B). Far more serious are faulty models of such complex sys-\ntems as an industrial plant or passenger airplane. Misunderstand-\ning there can lead to devastating accidents.\nConsider the thermostat that controls room heating and cooling \nsystems. How does it work? The average thermostat offers almost \nno evidence of its operation except in a highly roundabout man-\nner.

One commonly held folk theory of the working of a \nthermostat is that it is like a valve: the thermostat controls how \nmuch heat (or cold) comes out of the device. Hence, to heat or cool \nsomething most quickly, set the thermostat so that the device is on \nmaximum.

In fact, the information \nprovided misleads people into forming the wrong, quite inap-\npropriate model.\nThe real point of these examples is not that some people have er-\nroneous beliefs; it is that everyone forms stories (conceptual mod-\nels) to explain what they have observed. In the absence of external \ninformation, people can let their imagination run free as long as \nthe conceptual models they develop account for the facts as they \nperceive them. As a result, people use their thermostats inappro-\npriately, causing themselves unnecessary effort, and often resulting \nin large temperature swings, thus wasting energy, which is both a \nneedless expense and bad for the environment.

This can lead to unintended results. \nRepeated presses might intensify the response much more than was \nintended. Alternatively, a second request might cancel the previous \none, so that an odd number of pushes produces the desired result, \nwhereas an even number leads to no result.\nThe tendency to repeat an action when the first attempt fails \ncan be disastrous.

That way, the \nexpectations are liable to be exceeded, leading to a happy result.\nWhen it is difficult to determine the cause of a difficulty, where \ndo people put the blame? Often people will use their own concep-\ntual models of the world to determine the perceived causal rela-\ntionship between the thing being blamed and the result. The word \nperceived is critical: the causal relationship does not have to exist; \nthe person simply has to think it is there. Sometimes the result is \nto attribute cause to things that had nothing to do with the action.\nSuppose I try to use an everyday thing, but I can’t. Who is at \nfault: me or the thing? We are apt to blame ourselves, especially if \nothers are able to use it. Suppose the fault really lies in the device, \nso that lots of people have the same problems. Because everyone \nperceives the fault to be his or her own, nobody wants to admit \nto having trouble. This creates a conspiracy of silence, where the \nfeelings of guilt and helplessness among people are kept hidden.\nInterestingly enough, the common tendency to blame ourselves \nfor failures with everyday objects goes against the normal attribu-\ntions we make about ourselves and others. Everyone sometimes \nacts in a way that seems strange, bizarre, or simply wrong and \ninappropriate. When we do this, we tend to attribute our behavior \nto the environment.

The events can be seen from two differ-\nent points of view with two different interpretations: common re-\nsponses to the trials of life or the result of an explosive, irascible \npersonality.\nIt seems natural for people to blame their own misfortunes on \nthe environment.

In \nfact, the design of everyday things (and the design of mathematics \ncourses) seems almost guaranteed to cause this. We could call this \nphenomenon taught helplessness.\nWhen people have trouble using technology, especially when \nthey perceive (usually incorrectly) that nobody else is having the \nsame problems, they tend to blame themselves. Worse, the more \nthey have trouble, the more helpless they may feel, believing that \nthey must be technically or mechanically inept. This is just the op-\nposite of the more normal situation where people blame their own \ndifficulties on the environment. This false blame is especially ironic \nbecause the culprit here is usually the poor design of the technol-\nogy, so blaming the environment (the technology) would be com-\npletely appropriate.\nConsider the normal mathematics curriculum, which continues \nrelentlessly on its way, each new lesson assuming full knowledge \nand understanding of all that has passed before. Even though each \npoint may be simple, once you fall behind it is hard to catch up. \nThe result: mathematics phobia—not because the material is diffi-\ncult, but because it is taught so that difficulty in one stage hinders \nfurther progress. The problem is that once failure starts, it is soon \ngeneralized by self-blame to all of mathematics. Similar processes \nare at work with technology. The vicious cycle starts: if you fail \nat something, you think it is your fault. Therefore you think you \ncan’t do that task. As a result, next time you have to do the task, \nyou believe you can’t, so you don’t even try. The result is that you \ncan’t, just as you thought.\nYou’re trapped in a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nPOSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY\nJust as we learn to give up after repeated failure, we can learn op-\ntimistic, positive responses to life. For years, psychologists focused \nupon the gloomy story of how people failed, on the limits of hu-\nman abilities, and on psychopathologies—depression, mania, para-\nnoia, and so on.

In fact, the normal emotional state \nof most people is positive. When something doesn’t work, it can \nbe considered an interesting challenge, or perhaps just a positive \nlearning experience.\nWe need to remove the word failure from our vocabulary, replac-\ning it instead with learning experience. To fail is to learn: we learn \nmore from our failures than from our successes. With success, sure, \nwe are pleased, but we often have no idea why we succeeded. With \nfailure, it is often possible to figure out why, to ensure that it will \nnever happen again.\nScientists know this. Scientists do experiments to learn how the \nworld works. Sometimes their experiments work as expected, but \noften they don’t. Are these failures? No, they are learning expe-\nriences. Many of the most important scientific discoveries have \ncome from these so-called failures.\nFailure can be such a powerful learning tool that many designers \ntake pride in their failures that happen while a product is still in \ndevelopment. One design firm, IDEO, has it as a creed: “Fail often, \nfail fast,” they say, for they know that each failure teaches them a \nlot about what to do right. Designers need to fail, as do research-\ners. I have long held the belief—and encouraged it in my students \nand employees—that failures are an essential part of exploration \nand creativity. If designers and researchers do not sometimes fail, it \nis a sign that they are not trying hard enough—they are not think-\ning the great creative thoughts that will provide breakthroughs in \nhow we do things. It is possible to avoid failure, to always be safe. \nBut that is also the route to a dull, uninteresting life.\nThe designs of our products and services must also follow this \nphilosophy. So, to the designers who are reading this, let me give \nsome advice:\n• Do not blame people when they fail to use your products properly.\n•  Take people’s difficulties as signifiers of where the product can be \nimproved.\n",

If the wrong key was pressed, the last few minutes’ work \nwas irrevocably lost.\nI pointed out this problem to the designer, explaining that I, \nmyself, had made the error frequently and that my analyses indi-\ncated that this was very likely to be a frequent error among users. \nThe designer’s first response was: “Why did you make that error? \nDidn’t you read the manual?” He proceeded to explain the differ-\nent functions of the two keys.\n",

He claimed that I was the only per-\nson who had ever complained, and the company’s employees had \nbeen using the system for many months. I was skeptical, so we \nwent together to some of the employees and asked them whether \nthey had ever hit the Return key when they should have hit Enter. \nAnd did they ever lose their work as a result?\n“Oh, yes,” they said, “we do that a lot.”\nWell, how come nobody ever said anything about it? After all, \nthey were encouraged to report all problems with the system. The \nreason was simple: when the system stopped working or did some-\nthing strange, they dutifully reported it as a problem.

When people collaborate with one anoth-\ner, the word error is never used to characterize another person’s \nutterance.

The machine should accept normal hu-\nman behavior, but just as people often subconsciously assess the \naccuracy of things being said, machines should judge the quality of \ninformation given it, in this case to help its operators avoid griev-\nous errors because of simple slips (discussed in Chapter 5).

In other words: inappropriate program-\nming. Consider these examples.\nMany of us spend hours filling out forms on computers—forms \nthat require names, dates, addresses, telephone numbers, mone-\ntary sums, and other information in a fixed, rigid format. Worse, \noften we are not even told the correct format until we get it wrong. \nWhy not figure out the variety of ways a person might fill out a \nform and accommodate all of them? Some companies have done \nexcellent jobs at this, so let us celebrate their actions.\nConsider Microsoft’s calendar program. Here, it is possible to \nspecify dates any way you like: “November 23, 2015,” “23 Nov. \n15,” or “11.23.15.” It even accepts phrases such as “a week from \nThursday,” “tomorrow,” “a week from tomorrow,” or “yesterday.” \nSame with time. You can enter the time any way you want: “3:45 \nPM,” “15.35,” “an hour,” “two and one-half hours.” Same with \ntelephone numbers: Want to start with a + sign (to indicate the code \nfor international dialing)? No problem. Like to separate the num-\nber fields with spaces, dashes, parentheses, slashes, periods? No \nproblem. As long as the program can decipher the date, time, or \ntelephone number into a legal format, it is accepted. I hope the \nteam that worked on this got bonuses and promotions.\nAlthough I single out Microsoft for being the pioneer in accept-\ning a wide variety of formats, it is now becoming standard prac-\ntice. By the time you read this, I would hope that every program \nwould permit any intelligible format for names, dates, phone num-\nbers, street addresses, and so on, transforming whatever is entered \ninto whatever form the internal programming needs. But I predict \nthat even in the twenty-second century, there will still be forms \nthat require precise accurate (but arbitrary) formats for no reason \nexcept the laziness of the programming team.

Knowledge is both in the head and in the world. Technically, \nknowledge can only be in the head, because knowledge requires in-\nterpretation and understanding, but once the world’s structure has \nbeen interpreted and understood, it counts as knowledge. Much of \nthe knowledge a person needs to do a task can be derived from the \ninformation in the world. Behavior is determined by combining the \nknowledge in the head with that in the world. For this chapter, I will \nuse the term “knowledge” for both what is in the head and what is \nin the world. Although technically imprecise, it simplifies the discus-\nsion and understanding.\nFIGURE 3.1. Which Is the US One-Cent Coin, the Penny?

Perfect behavior results if \nthe combined knowledge in the head and in the world is sufficient to \ndistinguish an appropriate choice from all others.\n3.  Natural constraints exist in the world. The world has many nat-\nural, physical constraints that restrict the possible behavior: such \nthings as the order in which parts can go together and the ways \nby which an object can be moved, picked up, or otherwise manip-\nulated. This is knowledge in the world. Each object has physical \nfeatures—projections, depressions, screw threads, appendages—\nthat limit its relationships with other objects, the operations that \ncan be performed on it, what can be attached to it, and so on.\n4.  Knowledge of cultural constraints and conventions exists in the \nhead. Cultural constraints and conventions are learned artificial re-\nstrictions on behavior that reduce the set of likely actions, in many \ncases leaving only one or two possibilities. This is knowledge in the \nhead. Once learned, these constraints apply to a wide variety of cir-\ncumstances.\nBecause behavior can be guided by the combination of internal \nand external knowledge and constraints, people can minimize the \namount of material they must learn, as well as the completeness, \nprecision, accuracy, or depth of the learning.

Combine the two, knowledge in the head \nand in the world, and performance is even better. How can the \ndesigner put knowledge into the device itself?\nChapters 1 and 2 introduced a wide range of fundamental design \nprinciples derived from research on human cognition and emotion. \nThis chapter shows how knowledge in the world combines with \nknowledge in the head. Knowledge in the head is knowledge in \nthe human memory system, so this chapter contains a brief review \nof the critical aspects of memory necessary for the design of usable \nproducts. I emphasize that for practical purposes, we do not need \nto know the details of scientific theories but simpler, more general, \nuseful approximations. Simplified models are the key to successful \napplication. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how natu-\nral mappings present information in the world in a manner readily \ninterpreted and usable.\nKNOWLEDGE IS IN THE WORLD\nWhenever knowledge needed to do a task is readily available in \nthe world, the need for us to learn it diminishes. For example, we \nlack knowledge about common coins, even though we recognize \nthem just fine (Figure 3.1). In knowing what our currency looks \nlike, we don’t need to know all the details, simply sufficient knowl-\nedge to distinguish one value of currency from another.

Usually each key is labeled, so nontypists can hunt and peck \nletter by letter, relying on knowledge in the world and minimizing \nthe time required for learning. The problem is that such typing is \nslow and difficult. With experience, of course, hunt-and-peckers \nlearn the positions of many of the letters on the keyboard, even \nwithout instruction, and typing speed increases notably, quickly \nsurpassing handwriting speeds and, for some, reaching quite re-\nspectable rates.

The \nknowledge is still mostly in the world, not in the head.\nIf a person needs to type large amounts of material regularly, fur-\nther investment is worthwhile: a course, a book, or an interactive \nprogram. The important thing is to learn the proper placement of \nfingers on the keyboard, to learn to type without looking, to get \nknowledge about the keyboard from the world into the head.

Note \nthat knowledge of the rules does not mean they are followed. The \ndrivers in many cities are often quite knowledgeable about the of-\nficial driving regulations, but they do not necessarily obey them. \nMoreover, the knowledge does not have to be true. New York City \nis actually south of Rome. China has only slightly more people \nthan India (roughly 10 percent).

Here is what happened in France:\nPARIS With a good deal of fanfare, the French government released the \nnew 10-franc coin (worth a little more than $1.50) on Oct. 22 [1986]. \nThe public looked at it, weighed it, and began confusing it so quickly \nwith the half-franc coin (worth only 8 cents) that a crescendo of fury \nand ridicule fell on both the government and the coin.\nFive weeks later, Minister of Finance Edouard Balladur suspended \ncirculation of the coin. Within another four weeks, he canceled it \naltogether.\nIn retrospect, the French decision seems so foolish that it is hard to \nfathom how it could have been made. After much study, designers came \nup with a silver-colored coin made of nickel and featuring a modernistic \ndrawing by artist Joaquim Jimenez of a Gallic rooster on one side and \nof Marianne, the female symbol of the French republic, on the other. \nThe coin was light, sported special ridges on its rim for easy reading by \nelectronic vending machines and seemed tough to counterfeit.\nBut the designers and bureaucrats were obviously so excited by their \ncreation that they ignored or refused to accept the new coin’s similar-\nity to the hundreds of millions of silver-colored, nickel-based half-franc \ncoins in circulation [whose] size and weight were perilously simi-\nlar. (Stanley Meisler. Copyright © 1986, Los Angeles Times.

Psychological research suggests that people \nmaintain only partial descriptions of the things to be remembered. \nIn the three examples of new coins introduced in the United States, \nGreat Britain, and France, the descriptions formed to distinguish \namong national currency were not precise enough to distinguish be-\ntween a new coin and at least one of the old coins.\n",

Anthony Dollar,” at www.wiki\ncoins.com. Retrieved May 29, 2012)\nHere is the answer. Why not any confusion? We learn to dis-\ncriminate among things by looking for distinguishing features. In \nthe United States, size is one major way of distinguishing among \ncoins, but not among paper money. With paper money, all the bills \nare the same size, so Americans ignore size and look at the printed \nnumbers and images. Hence, we often confuse similar-size Amer-\nican coins but only seldom confuse similar-size American bills. \nBut people who come from a country that uses size and color of \ntheir paper money to distinguish among the amounts (for exam-\nple, Great Britain or any country that uses the euro) have learned \nto use size and color to distinguish among paper money and \ntherefore are invariably confused when dealing with bills from \nthe United States.\n",

The ballads \nand tales told by the traveling storytellers used multiple poetic \nconstraints, including rhyme, rhythm, meter, assonance, allitera-\ntion, and onomatopoeia, while also remaining consistent with the \nstory being told.\nConsider these two examples:\nOne. I am thinking of three words: one means “a mythical being,” \nthe second is “the name of a building material,” and the third is “a unit \nof time.” What words do I have in mind?\nTwo. This time look for rhyming words. I am thinking of three \nwords: one rhymes with “post,” the second with “eel,” and the third \nwith “ear.” What words am I thinking of? (From Rubin & Wallace, 1989.)\nIn both examples, even though you might have found answers, they \nwere not likely to be the same three that I had in mind. There sim-\nply are not enough constraints. But suppose I now tell you that the \nwords I seek are the same in both tasks: What is a word that means \na mythical being and rhymes with “post”? What word is the name \nof a building material and rhymes with “eel”? And what word is a \nunit of time and rhymes with “ear”? Now the task is easy: the joint \nspecification of the words completely constrains the selection. When \nthe psychologists David Rubin and Wanda Wallace studied these \nexamples in their laboratory, people almost never got the correct \nmeanings or rhymes for the first two tasks, but most people correctly \nanswered, “ghost,” “steel,” and “year” in the combined task.\nThe classic study of memory for epic poetry was done by Albert \nBates Lord.

He demon-\nstrated that the “singer of tales,” the person who learns epic poems \nand goes from village to village reciting them, is really re-creating \nthem, composing poetry on the fly in such a way that it obeys the \nrhythm, theme, story line, structure, and other characteristics of \nthe poem. This is a prodigious feat, but it is not an example of rote \nmemory.\nThe power of multiple constraints allows one singer to listen to \nanother singer tell a lengthy tale once, and then after a delay of \na few hours or a day, to recite “the same song, word for word, \nand line for line.” In fact, as Lord points out, the original and new \nrecitations are not the same word for word, but both teller and \nlistener perceive them as the same, even when the second version \nwas twice as long as the first. They are the same in the ways that \nmatter to the listener: they tell the same story, express the same \nideas, and follow the same rhyme and meter. They are the same in \nall senses that matter to the culture. Lord shows just how the com-\nbination of memory for poetics, theme, and style combines with \ncultural structures into what he calls a “formula” for producing a \npoem perceived as identical to earlier recitations.\nThe notion that someone should be able to recite word for word \nis relatively modern. Such a notion can be held only after printed \ntexts become available; otherwise who could judge the accuracy of \na recitation? Perhaps more important, who would care?\nAll this is not to detract from the feat. Learning and reciting an \nepic poem, such as Homer’s Odyssey and Iliad, is clearly difficult \neven if the singer is re-creating it: there are twenty-seven thousand \nlines of verse in the combined written version. Lord points out that \nthis length is excessive, probably produced only during the spe-\ncial circumstances in which Homer (or some other singer) dictated \nthe story slowly and repetitively to the person who first wrote it \ndown. Normally the length would be varied to accommodate the \nwhims of the audience, and no normal audience could sit through \ntwenty-seven thousand lines.

It is impressive even allowing for the fact that the poem is \nre-created as opposed to memorized, because neither the singer \nnor the audience expect word-for-word accuracy (nor would either \nhave any way of verifying that).\nMost of us do not learn epic poems. But we do make use of strong \nconstraints that serve to simplify what must be retained in memory. \nConsider an example from a completely different domain: taking \napart and reassembling a mechanical device. Typical items in the \nhome that an adventuresome person might attempt to repair in-\nclude a door lock, toaster, and washing machine. The device is apt \nto have tens of parts. What has to be remembered to be able to put \nthe parts together again in a proper order? Not as much as might \nappear from an initial analysis. In the extreme case, if there are ten \nparts, there are 10! (ten factorial) different ways in which to reas-\nsemble them—a little over 3.5 million alternatives.\nBut few of these possibilities are possible: there are numerous \nphysical constraints on the ordering. Some pieces must be assem-\nbled before it is even possible to assemble the others. Some pieces \nare physically constrained from fitting into the spots reserved for \nothers: bolts must fit into holes of an appropriate diameter and \ndepth; nuts and washers must be paired with bolts and screws \nof appropriate sizes; and washers must always be put on before \nnuts. There are even cultural constraints: we turn screws clock-\nwise to tighten, counterclockwise to loosen; the heads of screws \ntend to go on the visible part (front or top) of a piece, bolts on the \nless visible part (bottom, side, or interior); wood screws and ma-\nchine screws look different and are inserted into different kinds \nof materials. In the end, the apparently large number of decisions \nis reduced to only a few choices that should have been learned \nor otherwise noted during the disassembly. The constraints by \nthemselves are often not sufficient to determine the proper reas-\nsembly of the device—mistakes do get made—but the constraints \nreduce the amount that must be learned to a reasonable quantity. \nConstraints are powerful tools for the designer: they are exam-\nined in detail in Chapter 4.\n",

Retention is affected by both time and the num-\nber of items.

The capacity is items because people can \nremember roughly the same number of digits and words, and al-\nmost the same number of simple three- to five-word phrases. How \ncan this be?

Whatever the size, it is so large as \nnot to impose any practical limit.\nThe role of sleep in the strengthening of LTM is still not well un-\nderstood, but there are numerous papers investigating the topic. \nOne possible mechanism is that of rehearsal. It has long been \nknown that rehearsal of material—mentally reviewing it while still \nactive in working memory (STM)—is an important component of \nthe formation of long-term memory traces. “Whatever makes you \nrehearse during sleep is going to determine what you remember \nlater, and conversely, what you’re going to forget,” said Professor \nKen Paller of Northwestern University, one of the authors of a re-\ncent study on the topic (Oudiette, Antony, Creery, and Paller, 2013). \nBut although rehearsal in sleep strengthens memories, it might \nalso falsify them: “Memories in our brain are changing all of the \ntime. Sometimes you improve memory storage by rehearsing all \nthe details, so maybe later you remember better—or maybe worse \nif you’ve embellished too much.”\nRemember how you answered this question from Chapter 2?\nIn the house you lived in three houses ago, as you entered the front door, \nwas the doorknob on the left or right?\nFor most people, the question requires considerable effort just to \nrecall which house is involved, plus one of the special techniques \ndescribed in Chapter 2 for putting yourself back at the scene and \nreconstructing the answer.

In both cases, it can \ntake considerable time and effort to get to the answer. Moreover, \nthe answer is not directly retrieved in a manner analogous to the \nway we read answers from books or websites. The answer is a re-\nconstruction of the knowledge, so it is subject to biases and dis-\ntortions. Knowledge in memory is meaningful, and at the time of \nretrieval, a person might subject it to a different meaningful inter-\npretation than is wholly accurate.\nA major difficulty with LTM is in organization. How do we find \nthe things we are trying to remember? Most people have had the \n“tip of the tongue” experience when trying to remember a name \nor word: there is a feeling of knowing, but the knowledge is not \nconsciously available. Sometime later, when engaged in some \nother, different activity, the name may suddenly pop into the \nconscious mind. The way by which people retrieve the needed \nknowledge is still unknown, but probably involves some form \nof pattern-matching mechanism coupled with a confirmatory pro-\ncess that checks for consistency with the required knowledge. This \nis why when you search for a name but continually retrieve the \nwrong name, you know it is wrong. Because this false retrieval im-\npedes the correct retrieval, you have to turn to some other activity \nto allow the subconscious memory retrieval process to reset itself.\nBecause retrieval is a reconstructive process, it can be erroneous. \nWe may reconstruct events the way we would prefer to remember \nthem, rather than the way we experienced them. It is relatively \neasy to bias people so that they form false memories, “remember-\ning” events in their lives with great clarity, even though they never \noccurred. This is one reason that eyewitness testimony in courts of \nlaw is so problematic: eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable. A \nhuge number of psychological experiments show how easy it is to \nimplant false memories into people’s minds so convincingly that \npeople refuse to admit that the memory is of an event that never \nhappened.\nKnowledge in the head is actually knowledge in memory: inter-\nnal knowledge.

The items to be retained seem arbi-\ntrary, with no meaning and no particular relationship to one another \nor to things already known.\n2.  Memory for meaningful things. The items to be retained form \nmeaningful relationships with themselves or with other things al-\nready known.\nMEMORY FOR ARBITRARY AND MEANINGFUL THINGS\nArbitrary knowledge can be classified as the simple remembering \nof things that have no underlying meaning or structure. A good \nexample is the memory of the letters of the alphabet and their or-\ndering, the names of people, and foreign vocabulary, where there \nappears to be no obvious structure to the material. This also ap-\nplies to the learning of the arbitrary key sequences, commands, \ngestures, and procedures of much of our modern technology: This \nis rote learning, the bane of modern existence.\nSome things do require rote learning: the letters of the alphabet, for \nexample, but even here we add structure to the otherwise mean-\ningless list of words, turning the alphabet into a song, using the \nnatural constraints of rhyme and rhythm to create some structure.\nRote learning creates problems. First, because what is being \nlearned is arbitrary, the learning is difficult: it can take con-\nsiderable time and effort. Second, when a problem arises, the \nmemorized sequence of actions gives no hint of what has gone \nwrong, no suggestion of what might be done to fix the problem. \nAlthough some things are appropriate to learn by rote, most are \nnot. Alas, it is still the dominant method of instruction in many \nschool systems, and even for much adult training. This is how \nsome people are taught to use computers, or to cook.

As we saw in the discussion of these methods for \nSTM, even strings of digits can be remembered if they can be asso-\nciated with meaningful structures. People who have not received \nthis training or who have not invented some methods themselves \noften try to manufacture some artificial structure, but these are of-\nten rather unsatisfactory, which is why the learning is so bad.\nMost things in the world have a sensible structure, which tre-\nmendously simplifies the memory task. When things make sense, \nthey correspond to knowledge that we already have, so the new \nmaterial can be understood, interpreted, and integrated with pre-\nviously acquired material. Now we can use rules and constraints \nto help understand what things go together. Meaningful structure \ncan organize apparent chaos and arbitrariness.\nRemember the discussion of conceptual models in Chapter 1? \nPart of the power of a good conceptual model lies in its ability to \nprovide meaning to things. Let’s look at an example to show how \na meaningful interpretation transforms an apparently arbitrary \ntask into a natural one. Note that the appropriate interpretation \nmay not at first be obvious; it, too, is knowledge and has to be \ndiscovered.\nA Japanese colleague, Professor Yutaka Sayeki of the University \nof Tokyo, had difficulty remembering how to use the turn signal \nswitch on his motorcycle’s left handlebar. Moving the switch for-\nward signaled a right turn; backward, a left turn. The meaning of \nthe switch was clear and unambiguous, but the direction in which \nit should be moved was not. Sayeki kept thinking that because \nthe switch was on the left handlebar, pushing it forward should \nsignal a left turn. That is, he was trying to map the action “push \nthe left switch forward” to the intention “turn left,” which was \nwrong. As a result, he had trouble remembering which switch di-\nrection should be used for which turning direction. Most motor-\ncycles have the turn-signal switch mounted differently, rotated \n90 degrees, so that moving it left signals a left turn; moving it \n",

But the \nturn switch on Sayeki’s motorcycle moved forward and back, not \nleft and right. How could he learn it?\nSayeki solved the problem by reinterpreting the action. Consider \nthe way the handlebars of the motorcycle turn. For a left turn, the \nleft handlebar moves backward. For a right turn, the left handlebar \nmoves forward. The required switch movements exactly paralleled \nthe handlebar movements. If the task is conceptualized as signal-\ning the direction of motion of the handlebars rather than the direc-\ntion of the motorcycle, the switch motion can be seen to mimic the \ndesired motion; finally we have a natural mapping.\nWhen the motion of the switch seemed arbitrary, it was difficult to \nremember. Once Professor Sayeki had invented a meaningful relation-\nship, he found it easy to remember the proper switch operation. (Ex-\nperienced riders will point out that this conceptual model is wrong: to \nturn a bike, one first steers in the opposite direction of the turn. This is \ndiscussed as Example 3 in the next section, “Approximate Models.”)\nThe design implications are clear: provide meaningful struc-\ntures. Perhaps a better way is to make memory unnecessary: put \nthe required information in the world. This is the power of the \ntraditional graphical user interface with its old-fashioned menu \nstructure. When in doubt, one could always examine all the menu \nitems until the desired one was found.

The precise opposite is \nthe case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important \noperations which we can perform without thinking about them.

But most people \ncan’t do this without pencil and paper because there are too many \nintermediate numbers to maintain in STM.\nWant a simpler way? Try this approximation—you can do it in \nyour head, there is no need for paper or pencil:\n°C = (°F–30) / 2\nPlug in 55 for °F, and ºC = (55–30) / 2 = 12.5º. Is the equation an \nexact conversion?

It gets further off at lower or \nhigher temperatures, but for everyday use, it is wonderful. Ap-\nproximations are good enough for practical use.\nEXAMPLE 2: A MODEL OF SHORT-TERM MEMORY\nHere is an approximate model for STM:\nThere are five memory slots in short-term memory.

But there, I also pointed out \nthat the conceptual model was wrong.\nWhy is the conceptual model for steering a motorcycle useful \neven though it is wrong? Steering a motorcycle is counterintuitive: \nto turn to the left, the handlebars must first be turned to the right. \nThis is called countersteering, and it violates most people’s concep-\ntual models. Why is this true? Shouldn’t we rotate the handlebars \nleft to turn the bike left?

This weight shift \nthen causes the bike to turn left.\nExperienced riders often do the correct operations subcon-\nsciously, unaware that they start a turn by rotating the handlebars \nopposite from the intended direction, thus violating their own \nconceptual models. Motorcycle training courses have to conduct \nspecial exercises to convince riders that this is what they are doing.\nYou can test this counterintuitive concept on a bicycle or motor-\ncycle by getting up to a comfortable speed, placing the palm of the \nhand on the end of the left handlebar, and gently pushing it forward. \nThe handlebars and front wheel will turn to the right and the body \nwill lean to the left, resulting in the bike—and the handlebars—\nturning to the left.\nProfessor Sayeki was fully aware of this contradiction between \nhis mental scheme and reality, but he wanted his memory aid to \nmatch his conceptual model. Conceptual models are powerful ex-\nplanatory devices, useful in a variety of circumstances.

Moreover, the numbers come out left to \nright, the way we use them, not right to left, as we write them while \nlaboriously using pencil and paper to compute the answers. These \nexperts use special techniques that minimize the load on working \nmemory, but they do so at the cost of having to learn numerous \nspecial methods for different ranges and forms of problems.\nIsn’t this something we should all learn? Why aren’t school \nsystems teaching this? My answer is simple: Why bother? I can \nestimate the answer in my head with reasonable accuracy, often \ngood enough for the purpose.

If all stoves used the same arrange-\nment of controls, even if it is unnatural, everyone could learn it \nonce and forever after get things right. As the legend of Figure \n3.2 points out, even if the stove manufacturer is nice enough to \nensure that each pair of controls operates the pair of burners on its \nside, there are still four possible mappings. All four are in common \nuse. Some stoves arrange the controls in a vertical line, giving even \nmore possible mappings. Every stove seems to be different. Even \ndifferent stoves from the same manufacturer differ. No wonder \npeople have trouble, leading their food to go uncooked, and in the \nworst cases, leading to fire.\nNatural mappings are those where the relationship between the \ncontrols and the object to be controlled (the burners, in this case) \nis obvious. Depending upon circumstances, natural mappings will \nemploy spatial cues. Here are three levels of mapping, arranged in \ndecreasing effectiveness as memory aids:\n•  Best mapping: Controls are mounted directly on the item to be con-\ntrolled.\n•   Second-best mapping: Controls are as close as possible to the object \nto be controlled.\n•  Third-best mapping: Controls are arranged in the same spatial con-\nfiguration as the objects to be controlled.\nIn the ideal and second-best cases, the mappings are indeed clear \nand unambiguous.\nWant excellent examples of natural mapping?

Or the water turns on \nand then stops, so we wave our hands up and down, hoping to \nfind the precise location where the water turns on. When I wave \nmy hand in front of the towel dispenser but get no towel, I do \nnot know whether this means the dispenser is broken or out of \ntowels; or that I did the waving wrong, or in the wrong place; or \nthat maybe this doesn’t work by gesture, but I must push, pull, \nor turn something. The lack of signifiers is a real drawback. These \ndevices aren’t perfect, but at least they got the mapping right.\nIn the case of stove controls, it is obviously not possible to put \nthe controls directly on the burners. In most cases, it is also dan-\ngerous to put the controls adjacent to the burners, not only for fear \nof burning the person using the stove, but also because it would \ninterfere with the placement of cooking utensils. Stove controls are \nusually situated on the side, back, or front panel of the stove, in \nwhich case they ought to be arranged in spatial harmony with the \nburners, as in Figures 3.2 C and D.\nWith a good natural mapping, the relationship of the controls to \nthe burner is completely contained in the world; the load on hu-\nman memory is much reduced. With a bad mapping, however, a \nburden is placed upon memory, leading to more mental effort and \na higher chance of error. Without a good mapping, people new to \nthe stove cannot readily determine which burner goes with which \ncontrol and even frequent users will still occasionally err.\nWhy do stove designers insist on arranging the burners in a \ntwo-dimensional rectangular pattern, and the controls in a one-\ndimensional row?

Oddly, sometimes the best and the worst designs are \nmanufactured by the same companies and are illustrated side by \nside in their catalogs. Why do users still purchase stoves that cause \nso much trouble? Why not revolt and refuse to buy them unless the \ncontrols have an intelligent relationship to the burners?\nThe problem of the stovetop may seem trivial, but similar map-\nping problems exist in many situations, including commercial and \nindustrial settings, where selecting the wrong button, dial, or lever \ncan lead to major economic impact or even fatalities.\nIn industrial settings good mapping is of special importance, \nwhether it is a remotely piloted airplane, a large building crane \nwhere the operator is at a distance from the objects being manip-\nulated, or even in an automobile where the driver might wish to \ncontrol temperature or windows while driving at high speeds or in \ncrowded streets. In these cases, the best controls usually are spatial \nmappings of the controls to the items being controlled. We see this \ndone properly in most automobiles where the driver can operate \nthe windows through switches that are arranged in spatial corre-\nspondence to the windows.\nUsability is not often thought about during the purchasing pro-\ncess. Unless you actually test a number of units in a realistic envi-\nronment, doing typical tasks, you are not likely to notice the ease or \ndifficulty of use.

Before purchasing a new stovetop, pretend you are cooking \na meal. Do it right there in the store. Do not be afraid to make mis-\ntakes or ask stupid questions. Remember, any problems you have \nare probably the design’s fault, not yours.\nA major obstacle is that often the purchaser is not the user. Ap-\npliances may be in a home when people move in.

But why should we have to make a \ntradeoff? It wouldn’t be hard for all stove manufacturers to use \nnatural mappings, or at the least, to standardize their mappings.\nCulture and Design: \nNatural Mappings Can Vary with Culture\nI was in Asia, giving a talk. My computer was connected to a pro-\njector and I was given a remote controller for advancing through \nthe illustrations for my talk. This one had two buttons, one above \nthe other. The title was already displayed on the screen, so when I \nstarted, all I had to do was to advance to the first photograph in my \npresentation, but when I pushed the upper button, to my amaze-\nment I went backward through my illustrations, not forward.\n“How could this happen?” I wondered. To me, top means forward; \nbottom, backward. The mapping is clear and obvious. If the buttons \nhad been side by side, then the control would have been ambigu-\nous: which comes first, right or left? This controller appeared to use \nan appropriate mapping of top and bottom. Why was it working \nbackward? Was this yet another example of poor design?\nI decided to ask the audience. I showed them the controller and \nasked: “To get to my next picture, which button should I push, the \ntop or the bottom?” To my great surprise, the audience was split in \ntheir responses. Many thought that it should be the top button, just \nas I had thought. But a large number thought it should be the bottom.\nWhat’s the correct answer? I decided to ask this question to my \naudiences around the world. I discovered that they, too, were split \nin their opinions: some people firmly believe that it is the top but-\nton and some, just as firmly, believe it is the bottom button. Every-\none is surprised to learn that someone else might think differently.\nI was puzzled until I realized that this was a point-of-view prob-\nlem, very similar to the way different cultures view time.

As a person moves through time, the per-\nson moves forward along the time line. Other cultures use the same \nrepresentation, except now it is the person who is fixed and it is \ntime that moves: an event in the future moves toward the person.\nThis is precisely what was happening with the controller. Yes, \nthe top button does cause something to move forward, but the \nquestion is, what is moving? Some people thought that the person \nwould move through the images, other people thought the images \nwould move. People who thought that they moved through the \nimages wanted the top button to indicate the next one. People who \nthought it was the illustrations that moved would get to the next \nimage by pushing the bottom button, causing the images to move \ntoward them.\nSome cultures represent the time line vertically: up for the future, \ndown for the past. Other cultures have rather different views. For \nexample, does the future lie ahead or behind? To most of us, the \nquestion makes no sense: of course, the future lies ahead—the past \nis behind us. We speak this way, discussing the “arrival” of the fu-\nture; we are pleased that many unfortunate events of the past have \nbeen “left behind.”\nBut why couldn’t the past be in front of us and the future be-\nhind? Does that sound strange? Why? We can see what is in front \nof us, but not what is behind, just as we can remember what hap-\npened in the past, but we can’t remember the future. Not only that, \nbut we can remember recent events much more clearly than long-\npast events, captured neatly by the visual metaphor in which the \npast lines up before us, the most recent events being the closest \nso that they are clearly perceived (remembered), with long-past \nevents far in the distance, remembered and perceived with diffi-\nculty. Still sound weird? This is how the South American Indian \ngroup, the Aymara, represent time. When they speak of the future, \nthey use the phrase back days and often gesture behind them.

The choice of \ntext direction also corresponds to people’s preference for time di-\nrection. People whose native language is Arabic or Hebrew prefer \ntime to flow from right to left (the future being toward the left), \nwhereas those who use a left-to-right writing system have time \nflowing in the same direction, so the future is to the right.\nBut wait: I’m not finished. Is the time line relative to the person \nor relative to the environment? In some Australian Aborigine socie-\nties, time moves relative to the environment based on the direction \nin which the sun rises and sets. Give people from this community \na set of photographs structured in time (for example, photographs \nof a person at different ages or a child eating some food) and ask \nthem to order the photographs in time. People from technological \ncultures would order the pictures from left to right, most recent \nphoto to the right or left, depending upon how their printed lan-\nguage was written. But people from these Australian communities \nwould order them east to west, most recent to the west. If the per-\nson were facing south, the photo would be ordered left to right. If \nthe person were facing north, the photos would be ordered right to \nleft. If the person were facing west, the photos would be ordered \nalong a vertical line extending from the body outward, outwards \nbeing the most recent. And, of course, were the person facing east, \nthe photos would also be on a line extending out from the body, \nbut with the most recent photo closest to the body.\nThe choice of metaphor dictates the proper design for interac-\ntion. Similar issues show up in other domains. Consider the stan-\ndard problem of scrolling the text in a computer display. Should \nthe scrolling control move the text or the window? This was a \nfierce debate in the early years of display terminals, long before the \ndevelopment of modern computer systems. Eventually, there was \nmutual agreement that the cursor arrow keys—and then, later on, \nthe mouse—would follow the moving window metaphor. Move \nthe window down to see more text at the bottom of the screen. \nWhat this meant in practice is that to see more text at the bottom \nof the screen, move the mouse down, which moves the window \n",

For over two decades, everyone moved the \nscrollbars and mouse down in order to make the text move up.\nBut then smart displays with touch-operated screens arrived. \nNow it was only natural to touch the text with the fingers and \nmove it up, down, right, or left directly: the text moved in the same \ndirection as the fingers. The moving text metaphor became prev-\nalent. In fact, it was no longer thought of as a metaphor: it was \nreal. But as people switched back and forth between traditional \ncomputer systems that used the moving window metaphor and \ntouch-screen systems that used the moving text model, confusion \nreigned. As a result, one major manufacturer of both computers \nand smart screens, Apple, switched everything to the moving text \nmodel, but no other company followed Apple’s lead. As I write \nthis, the confusion still exists. How will it end? I predict the de-\nmise of the moving window metaphor: touch-screens and control \npads will dominate, which will cause the moving text model to \ntake over. All systems will move the hands or controls in the same \ndirection as they wish the screen images to move.

You will be able to judge for yourself.\nSimilar issues occurred in aviation with the pilot’s attitude indi-\ncator, the display that indicates the airplane’s orientation (roll or \nbank and pitch). The instrument shows a horizontal line to indicate \nthe horizon with a silhouette of an airplane seen from behind. If \nthe wings are level and on a line with the horizon, the airplane \nis flying in level flight. Suppose the airplane turns to the left, \nso it banks (tilts) left. What should the display look like? Should \nit show a left-tilting airplane against a fixed horizon, or a fixed \nairplane against a right-tilting horizon?

We have no choice but to \ncombine knowledge in the world with that in the head. \nKnowledge in the world includes perceived affordances \nand signifiers, the mappings between the parts that appear to \nbe controls or places to manipulate and the resulting actions, \nand the physical constraints that limit what can be done. \nKnowledge in the head includes conceptual models; cultural, \nsemantic, and logical constraints on behavior; and analogies \nbetween the current situation and previous experiences with \nother situations. Chapter 3 was devoted to a discussion of how \nwe acquire knowledge and use it. There, the major emphasis \nwas upon the knowledge in the head. This chapter focuses \nupon the knowledge in the world: how designers can provide \nthe critical information that allows people to know what to do, \neven when experiencing an unfamiliar device or situation.\nLet me illustrate with an example: building a motorcycle \nfrom a Lego set (a children’s construction toy). The Lego mo-\ntorcycle shown in Figure 4.1 has fifteen pieces, some rather spe-\ncialized. Of those fifteen pieces, only two pairs are alike—two \nrectangles with the word police on them, and the two hands of \n",

So, a number of the pieces are physically \ninterchangeable—that is, the physical constraints are not sufficient \nto identify where they go—but the appropriate role for every single \npiece of the motorcycle is still unambiguously determined. How? \nBy combining cultural, semantic, and logical constraints with the \nphysical ones. As a result, it is possible to construct the motorcycle \nwithout any instructions or assistance.\nIn fact, I did the experiment. I asked people to put together the \nparts; they had never seen the finished structure and were not even \ntold that it was a motorcycle (although it didn’t take them long to \nfigure this out). Nobody had any difficulty.\nThe visible affordances of the pieces were important in determin-\ning just how they fit together. The cylinders and holes character-\nistic of Lego suggested the major construction rule. The sizes and \nshapes of the parts suggested their operation. Physical constraints \nlimited what parts would fit together.

These four classes of constraints—physical, cultural, \nsemantic, and logical—seem to be universal, appearing in a wide \nvariety of situations.\nConstraints are powerful clues, limiting the set of possible ac-\ntions. The thoughtful use of constraints in design lets people read-\nily determine the proper course of action, even in a novel situation.\nFour Kinds of Constraints: \nPhysical, Cultural, Semantic, and Logical\nPHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS\nPhysical limitations constrain possible operations. Thus, a large \npeg cannot fit into a small hole. With the Lego motorcycle, the \nwindshield would fit in only one place. The value of physical con-\nstraints is that they rely upon properties of the physical world for \ntheir operation; no special training is necessary. With the proper \nuse of physical constraints, there should be only a limited number \nof possible actions—or, at least, desired actions can be made obvi-\nous, usually by being especially salient.\nPhysical constraints are made more effective and useful if they are \neasy to see and interpret, for then the set of actions is restricted be-\nfore anything has been done. Otherwise, a physical constraint pre-\nvents a wrong action from succeeding only after it has been tried.\nThe traditional cylindrical battery, Figure 4.2A, lacks sufficient \nphysical constraints. It can be put into battery compartments in \ntwo orientations: one that is correct, the other of which can damage \nthe equipment. The instructions in Figure 4.2B show that polarity \nis important, yet the inferior signifiers inside the battery compart-\nment makes it very difficult to determine the proper orientation \nfor the batteries.\nWhy not design a battery with which it would be impossible to \nmake an error: use physical constraints so that the battery will fit \nonly if properly oriented. Alternatively, design the battery or the \nelectrical contacts so that orientation doesn’t matter.\nFigure 4.3 shows a battery that has been designed so that orien-\ntation is irrelevant.

Although this \nseems to solve the problem, I have only seen this one example of \nsuch a battery: they are not widely available or used.\nAnother alternative is to invent battery contacts that allow our \nexisting cylindrical batteries to be inserted in either orientation yet \nstill work properly: Microsoft has invented this kind of contact, \nwhich it calls InstaLoad, and is attempting to convince equipment \nmanufacturers to use it.\nA third alternative is to design the shape of the battery so that \nit can fit in only one way. Most plug-in components do this well, \nusing shapes, notches, and protrusions to constrain insertion \n FIGURE 4.2. Cylindrical Battery: Where Constraints Are Needed.

So why can’t our everyday batteries be \nthe same?\nWhy does inelegant design persist for so long? This is called the \nlegacy problem, and it will come up several times in this book. Too \nmany devices use the existing standard—that is the legacy. If the \nsymmetrical cylindrical battery were changed, there would also \nhave to be a major change in a huge number of products. The new \nbatteries would not work in older equipment, nor the old batteries \nin new equipment. Microsoft’s design of contacts would allow us \nto continue to use the same batteries we are used to, but the prod-\nucts would have to switch to the new contacts. Two years after Mi-\ncrosoft’s introduction of InstaLoad, despite positive press, I could \nfind no products that use them—not even Microsoft products.\nLocks and keys suffer from a similar problem. Although it is usu-\nally easy to distinguish the smooth top part of a key from its jagged \nunderside, it is difficult to tell from the lock just which orienta-\ntion of the key is required, especially in dark environments. Many \nelectrical and electronic plugs and sockets have the same problem. \nAlthough they do have physical constraints to prevent improper \ninsertion, it is often extremely difficult to perceive their correct ori-\nentation, especially when keyholes and electronic sockets are in \ndifficult-to-reach, dimly lit locations. Some devices, such as USB \nplugs, are constrained, but the constraint is so subtle that it takes \nmuch fussing and fumbling to find the correct orientation. Why \naren’t all these devices orientation insensitive?\nIt is not difficult to design keys and plugs that work regardless of \nhow they are inserted. Automobile keys that are insensitive to the \norientation have long existed, but not all manufacturers use them. \nSimilarly, many electrical connectors are insensitive to orientation, \nbut again, only a few manufacturers use them. Why the resistance? \nSome of it results from the legacy concerns about the expense of \nmassive change. But much seems to be a classic example of cor-\nporate thinking: “This is the way we have always done things. We \ndon’t care about the customer.” It is, of course, true that difficulty \nin inserting keys, batteries, or plugs is not a big enough issue to \naffect the decision of whether to purchase something, but still, the \n",

After all, we don’t really care about \nkeys and locks: what we need is some way of ensuring that only \nauthorized people can get access to whatever is being locked. \nInstead of redoing the shapes of physical keys, make them irrel-\nevant. Once this is recognized, a whole set of solutions present \nthemselves: combination locks that do not require keys, or key-\nless locks that can be operated only by authorized people. One \nmethod is through possession of an electronic wireless device, \nsuch as the identification badges that unlock doors when they \nare moved close to a sensor, or automobile keys that can stay in \nthe pocket or carrying case. Biometric devices could identify the \nperson through face or voice recognition, fingerprints, or other \nbiometric measures, such as iris patterns. This approach is dis-\ncussed in Chapter 3, page 91.\nCULTURAL CONSTRAINTS\nEach culture has a set of allowable actions for social situations. \nThus, in our own culture we know how to behave in a restaurant—\neven one we have never been to before. This is how we manage \nto cope when our host leaves us alone in a strange room, at a \nstrange party, with strange people. And this is why we sometimes \nfeel frustrated, so incapable of action, when we are confronted \nwith a restaurant or group of people from an unfamiliar culture, \nwhere our normally accepted behavior is clearly inappropriate and \nfrowned upon. Cultural issues are at the root of many of the prob-\nlems we have with new machines: there are as yet no universally \naccepted conventions or customs for dealing with them.\nThose of us who study these things believe that guidelines for \ncultural behavior are represented in the mind by schemas, knowl-\nedge structures that contain the general rules and information nec-\nessary for interpreting situations and for guiding behavior. In some \nstereotypical situations (for example, in a restaurant), the schemas \nmay be very specialized. Cognitive scientists Roger Schank and \n",

Danger awaits those who delib-\nerately violate the frames of a culture.\nThe next time you are in an elevator, try violating cultural norms \nand see how uncomfortable that makes you and the other people \nin the elevator.

In a bus or streetcar, give your \nseat to the next athletic-looking person you see (the act is especially \neffective if you are elderly, pregnant, or disabled).\nIn the case of the Lego motorcycle of Figure 4.1, cultural con-\nstraints determine the locations of the three lights of the motor-\ncycle, which are otherwise physically interchangeable. Red is the \nculturally defined standard for a brake light, which is placed in \nthe rear. And a police vehicle often has a blue flashing light on top. \nAs for the yellow piece, this is an interesting example of cultural \nchange: few people today remember that yellow used to be a stan-\ndard headlight color in Europe and a few other locations (Lego \ncomes from Denmark). Today, European and North American stan-\ndards require white headlights. As a result, figuring out that the \nyellow piece represents a headlight on the front of the motorcycle \nis no longer as easy as it used to be. Cultural constraints are likely \nto change with time.\nSEMANTIC CONSTRAINTS\nSemantics is the study of meaning. Semantic constraints are those \nthat rely upon the meaning of the situation to control the set of \npossible actions. In the case of the motorcycle, there is only one \nmeaningful location for the rider, who must sit facing forward. The \npurpose of the windshield is to protect the rider’s face, so it must \nbe in front of the rider. Semantic constraints rely upon our knowl-\nedge of the situation and of the world. Such knowledge can be a \npowerful and important clue. But just as cultural constraints can \nchange with time, so, too, can semantic ones. Extreme sports push \n",

The blue light was \nlogically constrained.\nLogical constraints are often used by home dwellers who under-\ntake repair jobs.

It is not so amus-\ning to be one of those people: being hugged or kissed while trying \nto shake hands or bow. Or the other way around. Try kissing some-\none’s cheek three times (left, right, left) when the person expects \nonly one. Or worse, where he or she expects a handshake. Violation \nof cultural conventions can completely disrupt an interaction.\nConventions are actually a form of cultural constraint, usually \nassociated with how people behave. Some conventions determine \nwhat activities should be done; others prohibit or discourage ac-\ntions. But in all cases, they provide those knowledgeable of the \nculture with powerful constraints on behavior.\nSometimes these conventions are codified into international stan-\ndards, sometimes into laws, and sometimes both. In the early days \nof heavily traveled streets, whether by horses and buggies or by \nautomobiles, congestion and accidents arose. Over time, conven-\ntions developed about which side of the road to drive on, with dif-\nferent conventions in different countries. Who had precedence at \ncrossings? The first person to get there? The vehicle or person on \nthe right, or the person with the highest social status? All of these \nconventions have applied at one time or another. Today, worldwide \nstandards govern many traffic situations: Drive on only one side of \nthe street. The first car into an intersection has precedence. If both \narrive at the same time, the car on the right (or left) has precedence. \nWhen merging traffic lanes, alternate cars—one from that lane, \nthen one from this. The last rule is more of an informal convention: \nit is not part of any rule book that I am aware of, and although it \nis very nicely obeyed in the California streets on which I drive, the \nvery concept would seem strange in some parts of the world.\nSometimes conventions clash.

To operate a \ndoor, we have to find the side that opens and the part to be manip-\nulated; in other words, we need to figure out what to do and where \nto do it. We expect to find some visible signal, a signifier, for the \ncorrect operation: a plate, an extension, a hollow, an indentation—\nsomething that allows the hand to touch, grasp, turn, or fit into. \nThis tells us where to act. The next step is to figure out how: we \nmust determine what operations are permitted, in part by using \nthe signifiers, in part guided by constraints.\n",

The door might be operated with a foot pedal. Or maybe it \nis voice operated, and we must speak the magic phrase (“Open \nSimsim!”). In addition, some doors have signs on them, to pull, \npush, slide, lift, ring a bell, insert a card, type a password, smile, \nrotate, bow, dance, or, perhaps, just ask. Somehow, when a device \nas simple as a door has to have a sign telling you whether to pull, \npush, or slide, then it is a failure, poorly designed.\nConsider the hardware for an unlocked door. It need not have \nany moving parts: it can be a fixed knob, plate, handle, or groove. \nNot only will the proper hardware operate the door smoothly, but \nit will also indicate just how the door is to be operated: it will in-\ncorporate clear and unambiguous clues—signifiers. Suppose the \ndoor opens by being pushed. The easiest way to indicate this is to \nhave a plate at the spot where the pushing should be done.\nFlat plates or bars can clearly and unambiguously signify both \nthe proper action and its location, for their affordances constrain \nthe possible actions to that of pushing. Remember the discussion \nof the fire door and its panic bar in Chapter 2 (Figure 2.5, page 60)? \nThe panic bar, with its large horizontal surface, often with a sec-\nondary color on the part intended to be pushed, provides a good \nexample of an unambiguous signifier. It very nicely constrains \nimproper behavior when panicked people press against the door \nas they attempt to flee a fire. The best push bars offer both visible \naffordances that act as physical constraints on the action, and also \na visible signifier, thereby unobtrusively specifying what to do and \nwhere to do it.\nSome doors have appropriate hardware, well placed.

It \nis sometimes not even possible to determine where the doors are, \nlet alone whether and how they are slid, lifted, pushed, or pulled. \nThe focus on aesthetics may blind the designer (and the purchaser) \nto the lack of usability.

In many control rooms, \nrow upon row of identical-looking switches confront the operators. \nHow do they avoid the occasional error, confusion, or accidental \nbumping against the wrong control? Or mis-aim? They don’t. For-\ntunately, industrial settings are usually pretty robust. A few errors \nevery now and then are not important—usually.\nOne type of popular small airplane has identical-looking switches \nfor flaps and for landing gear, right next to one another. You might \nbe  surprised to learn how many pilots, while on the ground, have \ndecided to raise the flaps and instead raised the wheels. This very \nexpensive error happened frequently enough that the National \nTransportation Safety Board wrote a report about it. The analysts \npolitely pointed out that the proper design principles to avoid these \nerrors had been known for fifty years. Why were these design \nerrors still being made?\nBasic switches and controls should be relatively simple to de-\nsign well. But there are two fundamental difficulties.

But they liked spare, neat, modern design \nto a fault. Inside the house were, among other things, neat rows of \nlight switches: A horizontal row of four identical switches in the \nfront hall, a vertical column of six identical switches in the living \nroom. “You will get used to it,” the architects assured us when \nwe complained. We never did. Figure 4.4 shows an eight-switch \nbank that I found in a home I was visiting. Who could remember \nwhat each does? My home only had six switches, and that was bad \nenough. (Photographs of the switch plate from my Del Mar home \nare no longer available.)\nThe lack of clear communication among the people and organi-\nzations constructing parts of a system is perhaps the most common \ncause of complicated, confusing designs. A usable design starts \nwith careful observations of how the tasks being supported are \nactually performed, followed by a design process that results in a \ngood fit to the actual ways the tasks get performed. The technical \nname for this method is task analysis. The name for the entire pro-\ncess is human-centered design (HCD), discussed in Chapter 6.\nThe solutions to the problem posed by my Del Mar home require \nthe natural mappings described in Chapter 3. With six light switches \nmounted in a one-dimensional array, vertically on the wall, there is \nno way they can map naturally to the two-dimensional, horizontal \nplacement of the lights in the ceiling. Why place the switches flat \nagainst the wall? Why not redo things? Why not place the switches \nhorizontally, in exact analogy to the things being controlled, with \na two-dimensional layout so that the switches can be placed on a \nfloor plan of the building in exact correspondence to the areas that \nthey control? Match the layout of the lights with the layout of the \nswitches: the principle of natural mapping. You can see the result \nin Figure 4.5. We mounted a floor plan of the living room on a plate \nand oriented it to match the room. Switches were placed on the \nfloor plan so that each switch was located in the area controlled \n",

The plate was mounted with a slight tilt from the \nhorizontal to make it easy to see and to make the mapping clear: \nhad the plate been vertical, the mapping would still be ambiguous. \nThe plate was tilted rather than horizontal to discourage people \n(us or visitors) from placing objects, such as cups, on the plate: an \nexample of an anti-affordance. (We further simplified operations \nby moving the sixth switch to a different location where its mean-\ning was clear and it did not confuse, because it stood alone.)\nIt is unnecessarily difficult to implement this spatial mapping \nof switches to lights: the required parts are not available. I had to \nhire a skilled technician to construct the wall-mounted box and \ninstall the special switches and control equipment. Builders and \nelectricians need standardized components. Today, the switch \nboxes that are available to electricians are organized as rectangu-\nlar boxes meant to hold a long, linear string of switches and to \nbe mounted horizontally or vertically on the wall. To produce the \nappropriate spatial array, we would need a two-dimensional struc-\nture that could be mounted parallel to the floor, where the switches \nwould be mounted on the top of the box, on the horizontal surface. \nThe switch box should have a matrix of supports so that there can \nbe free, relatively unrestricted placement of the switches in what-\never pattern best suits the room. Ideally the box would use small \nswitches, perhaps low-voltage switches that would control a sepa-\nrately mounted control structure that takes care of the lights (which \nis what I did in my home). Switches and lights could communicate \n FIGURE 4.5. A Natural Mapping of Light \nSwitches to Lights. This is how I mapped \nfive switches to the lights in my living \nroom. I placed small toggle switches that \nfit onto a plan of the home’s living room, \nbalcony, and hall, with each switch placed \nwhere the light was located. The X by the \ncenter switch indicates where this panel \nwas located. The surface was tilted to make \nit easier to relate it to the horizontal ar-\nrangement of the lights, and the slope pro-\nvided a natural anti-affordance, preventing \npeople from putting coffee cups and drink \ncontainers on the controls.\n",

But these new switch boxes wouldn’t have to \nstick out. They could be placed in indented openings in the walls: \njust as there is room inside the wall for the existing switch boxes, \nthere is also room for an indented horizontal surface. Or the \nswitches could be mounted on a little pedestal.\nAs a side note, in the decades that have passed since the first edi-\ntion of this book was published, the section on natural mappings \nand the difficulties with light switches has received a very popular \nreception. Nonetheless, there are no commercial tools available \nto make it easy to implement these ideas in the home. I once tried \nto convince the CEO of the company whose smart home devices I \nhad used to implement the controls of Figure 4.5, to use the idea. \n“Why not manufacture the components to make it easy for people \nto do this,” I suggested. I failed.\nSomeday, we will get rid of the hard-wired switches, which re-\nquire excessive runs of electrical cable, add to the cost and diffi-\nculties of home construction, and make remodeling of electrical \ncircuits extremely difficult and time consuming. Instead, we will \nuse Internet or wireless signals to connect switches to the devices \nto be controlled. In this way, controls could be located anywhere. \nThey could be reconfigured or moved. We could have multiple con-\ntrols for the same item, some in our phones or other portable de-\nvices. I can control my home thermostat from anywhere in the \nworld: why can’t I do the same with my lights?

It will happen, but it \nmay take considerable time.\nAlas, like many things that change, new technologies will \nbring virtues and deficits. The controls are apt to be through \ntouch-sensitive screens, allowing excellent natural mapping to the \nspatial layouts involved, but lacking the physical affordances of \nphysical switches. They can’t be operated with the side of the arm \nor the elbow while trying to enter a room, hands loaded with pack-\nages or cups of coffee. Touch screens are fine if the hands are free. \nPerhaps cameras that recognize gestures will do the job.\nACTIVITY-CENTERED CONTROLS\nSpatial mapping of switches is not always appropriate. In many \ncases it is better to have switches that control activities: activity-\ncentered control. Many auditoriums in schools and companies \nhave computer-based controls, with switches labeled with such \nphrases as “video,” “computer,” “full lights,” and “lecture.” When \ncarefully designed, with a good, detailed analysis of the activi-\nties to be supported, the mapping of controls to activities works \nextremely well: video requires a dark auditorium plus control of \nsound level and controls to start, pause, and stop the presentation. \nProjected images require a dark screen area with enough light in \nthe auditorium so people can take notes. Lectures require some \nstage lights so the speaker can be seen. Activity-based controls are \nexcellent in theory, but the practice is difficult to get right. When it \nis done badly, it creates difficulties.\nA related but wrong approach is to be device-centered rather \nthan activity-centered. When they are device-centered, different \ncontrol screens cover lights, sound, computer, and video projec-\ntion. This requires the lecturer to go to one screen to adjust the \nlight, a different screen to adjust sound levels, and yet a different \nscreen to advance or control the images. It is a horrible cognitive \ninterruption to the flow of the talk to go back and forth among the \nscreens, perhaps to pause the video in order to make a comment \nor answer a question. Activity-centered controls anticipate this need \nand put light, sound level, and projection controls all in one location.\n",

All worked well until I was asked a \nquestion. I paused to answer it, but wanted to raise the room lights \nso I could see the audience. No, the activity of giving a talk with \nvisually presented images meant that room lights were fixed at a \ndim setting. When I tried to increase the light intensity, this took \nme out of “giving a talk” activity, so I did get the light to where I \nwanted it, but the projection screen also went up into the ceiling \nand the projector was turned off. The difficulty with activity-based \ncontrollers is handling the exceptional cases, the ones not thought \nabout during design.\nActivity-centered controls are the proper way to go, if the ac-\ntivities are carefully selected to match actual requirements. But \neven in these cases, manual controls will still be required because \nthere will always be some new, unexpected demand that requires \nidiosyncratic settings. As my example demonstrates, invoking \nthe manual settings should not cause the current activity to be \ncanceled.\nConstraints That Force the Desired Behavior\nFORCING FUNCTIONS\nForcing functions are a form of physical constraint: situations in \nwhich the actions are constrained so that failure at one stage pre-\nvents the next step from happening. Starting a car has a forcing \nfunction associated with it—the driver must have some physical \nobject that signifies permission to use the car. In the past, it was a \nphysical key to unlock the car doors and also to be placed into the \nignition switch, which allowed the key to turn on the electrical sys-\ntem and, if rotated to its extreme position, to activate the engine.\nToday’s cars have many means of verifying permission. Some still \nrequire a key, but it can stay in one’s pocket or carrying case. More \nand more, the key is not required and is replaced by a card, phone, \nor some physical token that can communicate with the car. As long \nas only authorized people have the card (which is, of course, the \nsame for keys), everything works fine. Electric or hybrid vehicles \n",

Because the vehicle \nwon’t start without the authentication proved by possession of the \nkey, it is a forcing function.\nForcing functions are the extreme case of strong constraints that \ncan prevent inappropriate behavior. Not every situation allows \nsuch strong constraints to operate, but the general principle can be \nextended to a wide variety of situations. In the field of safety engi-\nneering, forcing functions show up under other names, in partic-\nular as specialized methods for the prevention of accidents. Three \nsuch methods are interlocks, lock-ins, and lockouts.\nINTERLOCKS\nAn interlock forces operations to take place in proper sequence. \nMicrowave ovens and devices with interior exposure to high volt-\nage use interlocks as forcing functions to prevent people from \nopening the door of the oven or disassembling the devices without \nfirst turning off the electric power: the interlock disconnects the \npower the instant the door is opened or the back is removed. In \nautomobiles with automatic transmissions, an interlock prevents \nthe transmission from leaving the Park position unless the car’s \nbrake pedal is depressed.\nAnother form of interlock is the “dead man’s switch” in nu-\nmerous safety settings, especially for the operators of trains, lawn \nmowers, chainsaws, and many recreational vehicles. In Britain, \nthese are called the “driver’s safety device.” Many require that the \noperator hold down a spring-loaded switch to enable operation of \nthe equipment, so that if the operator dies (or loses control), the \nswitch will be released, stopping the equipment. Because some op-\nerators bypassed the feature by tying down the control (or placing \na heavy weight on foot-operated ones), various schemes have been \ndeveloped to determine that the person is really alive and alert. \nSome require a midlevel of pressure; some, repeated depressions \nand releases. Some require responses to queries. But in all cases, \n",

Standard lock-ins exist on many computer \napplications, where any attempt to exit the application without \nsaving work is prevented by a message prompt asking whether \nthat is what is really wanted (Figure 4. 6). These are so effective that \nI use them deliberately as my standard way of exiting. Rather than \nsaving a file and then exiting the program, I simply exit, knowing \nthat I will be given a simple way to save my work.

Thus music, videos, or \nelectronic books purchased from one company may be played or \nread on music and video players and e-book readers made by that \ncompany, but will fail with similar devices from other manufactur-\ners.

Actually, everyone loses, except for the one manufac-\nturer whose products dominate.\nLOCKOUTS\nWhereas a lock-in keeps someone in a space or prevents an action \nuntil the desired operations have been done, a lockout prevents \nsomeone from entering a space that is dangerous, or prevents an \nevent from occurring. A good example of a lockout is found in \nstairways of public buildings, at least in the United States (Figure \n4.7). In cases of fire, people have a tendency to flee in panic, down \nthe stairs, down, down, down, past the ground floor and into the \nbasement, where they might be trapped. The solution (required by \nthe fire laws) is not to allow simple passage from the ground floor \nto the basement.\nLockouts are usually used for safety reasons. Thus, small chil-\ndren are protected by baby locks on cabinet doors, covers for elec-\ntric outlets, and specialized caps on containers for drugs and toxic \nsubstances. The pin that prevents a fire extinguisher from being \nactivated until it is removed is a lockout forcing function to pre-\nvent accidental discharge.\n FIGURE 4.7.

The result \nis that many people will deliberately disable the forcing func-\ntion, thereby negating its safety feature. The clever designer has \nto minimize the nuisance value while retaining the safety feature \nof the forcing function that guards against the occasional tragedy. \nThe gate in Figure 4.7 is a clever compromise: sufficient restraint \nto make people realize they are leaving the ground floor, but not \nenough of an impediment to normal behavior that people will \nprop open the gate.\nOther useful devices make use of a forcing function. In some \npublic restrooms, a pull-down shelf is placed inconveniently on \nthe wall just behind the cubicle door, held in a vertical position by \na spring. You lower the shelf to the horizontal position, and the \nweight of a package or handbag keeps it there. The shelf’s position \nis a forcing function.

Affordances refer to the po-\ntential actions that are possible, but these are easily discoverable \nonly if they are perceivable: perceived affordances. It is the sig-\nnifier component of the perceived affordance that allows people \nto determine the possible actions. But how does one go from the \nperception of an affordance to understanding the potential action? \nIn many cases, through conventions.\nA doorknob has the perceived affordance of graspability. But \nknowing that it is the doorknob that is used to open and close \ndoors is learned: it is a cultural aspect of the design that knobs, \nhandles, and bars, when placed on doors, are intended to enable \nthe opening and shutting of those doors. The same devices on \nfixed walls would have a different interpretation: they might offer \nsupport, for example, but certainly not the possibility of opening \nthe wall. The interpretation of a perceived affordance is a cultural \nconvention.\n",

For exam-\nple, the means by which people eat is subject to strong cultural \nconstraints and conventions. Different cultures use different eat-\ning utensils. Some eat primarily with the fingers and bread. Some \nuse elaborate serving devices. The same is true of almost every \naspect of behavior imaginable, from the clothes that are worn; \nto the way one addresses elders, equals, and inferiors; and even \nto the order in which people enter or exit a room.

Was it really bad de-\nsign or, as the authors suggest, a completely unnecessary change to \nan otherwise satisfactory system? Here is what happened: the au-\nthors had encountered a new convention for elevators called “Ele-\nvator Destination Control.” Many people (including me) consider \nit superior to the one we are all used to. Its major disadvantage is \nthat it is different. It violates customary convention. Violations of \nconvention can be very disturbing. Here is the history.\nWhen “modern” elevators were first installed in buildings in \nthe late 1800s, they always had a human operator who controlled \nthe speed and direction of the elevator, stopped at the appropri-\n",

People would enter the \nelevator, greet the operator, and state which floor they wished to \ntravel to. When the elevators became automated, a similar con-\nvention was followed. People entered the elevator and told the \nelevator what floor they were traveling to by pushing the appro-\npriately marked button inside the elevator.\nThis is a pretty inefficient way of doing things. Most of you have \nprobably experienced a crowded elevator where every person \nseems to want to go to a different floor, which means a slow trip for \nthe people going to the higher floors. A destination-control eleva-\ntor system groups passengers, so that those going to the same floor \nare asked to use the same elevator and the passenger load is dis-\ntributed to maximize efficiency. Although this kind of grouping \nis only sensible for buildings that have a large number of elevators, \nthat would cover any large hotel, office, or apartment building.\nIn the traditional elevator, passengers stand in the elevator hall-\nway and indicate whether they wish to travel up or down. When an \nelevator arrives going in the appropriate direction, they get in and \nuse the keypad inside the elevator to indicate their destination \nfloor. As a result, five people might get into the same elevator each \nwanting a different floor. With destination control, the destination \nkeypads are located in the hallway outside the elevators and there \nare no keypads inside the elevators (Figure 4.8A and D). People \nare directed to whichever elevator will most efficiently reach their \nfloor. Thus, if there were five people desiring elevators, they might \nbe assigned to five different elevators. The result is faster trips for \neveryone, with a minimum of stops. Even if people are assigned to \nelevators that are not the next to arrive, they will get to their desti-\nnations faster than if they took earlier elevators. \nDestination control was invented in 1985, but the first commer-\ncial installation didn’t appear until 1990 (in Schindler elevators). \nNow, decades later, it is starting to appear more frequently as de-\nvelopers of tall buildings discover that destination control yields \nbetter service to passengers, or equal service with fewer elevators.\nHorrors! As Figure 4.8D confirms, there are no controls inside the \nelevator to specify a floor. What if passengers change their minds \n",

It’s simple: just get off at the next stop and go to the destina-\ntion control box in the elevator hall, and specify the intended floor.\nPEOPLE’S RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN CONVENTIONS\nPeople invariably object and complain whenever a new approach \nis introduced into an existing array of products and systems. Con-\nventions are violated: new learning is required. The merits of the \nnew system are irrelevant: it is the change that is upsetting. The \ndestination control elevator is only one of many such examples. \nThe metric system provides a powerful example of the difficulties \nin changing people’s conventions. \nThe metric scale of measurement is superior to the English scale \nof units in almost every dimension: it is logical, easy to learn, \nand easy to use in computations. Today, over two centuries have \npassed since the metric system was developed by the French in \nthe 1790s, yet three countries still resist its use: the United States, \nLiberia, and Myanmar. Even Great Britain has mostly switched, so \nthe only major country left that uses the older English system of \nunits is the United States. Why haven’t we switched? The change \nis too upsetting for the people who have to learn the new system, \nand the initial cost of purchasing new tools and measuring devices \nseems excessive. The learning difficulties are nowhere as complex \nas purported, and the cost would be relatively small because the \nmetric system is already in wide use, even in the United States.\nConsistency in design is virtuous. It means that lessons learned \nwith one system transfer readily to others. On the whole, consis-\ntency is to be followed. If a new way of doing things is only slightly \nbetter than the old, it is better to be consistent. But if there is to be \na change, everybody has to change.

Upon checking into Ranmoor \nHouse, each guest was given a pamphlet that provided useful infor-\nmation: where the churches were, the times of meals, the location of \nthe post office, and how to work the taps (faucets). “The taps on the \nwashhand basin are operated by pushing down gently.”\nWhen it was my turn to speak at the conference, I asked the audi-\nence about those taps. How many had trouble using them? Polite, \nrestrained tittering from the audience. How many tried to turn the \nhandle? A large show of hands. How many had to seek help? A few \nhonest folks raised their hands. Afterward, one woman came up to \nme and said that she had given up and walked the halls until she \nfound someone who could explain the taps to her. A simple sink, a \nsimple-looking faucet. But it looks as if it should be turned, not \npushed. If you want the faucet to be pushed, make it look as if it \nshould be pushed. (This, of course, is similar to the problem I had \nemptying the water from the sink in my hotel, described in Chapter 1.)\nWhy is such a simple, standard item as a water faucet so diffi-\ncult to get right? The person using a faucet cares about two things: \nwater temperature and rate of flow. But water enters the faucet \nthrough two pipes, hot and cold. There is a conflict between the \nhuman need for temperature and flow and the physical structure \nof hot and cold.\nThere are several ways to deal with this:\n•  Control both hot and cold water: Two controls, one for hot water, \nthe other cold.\n•  Control only temperature: One control, where rate of flow is fixed. \nRotating the control from its fixed position turns on the water at \n",

You turn off a faucet by tightening a screw \nthread (tightening a washer against its seat), thereby shutting off \nthe flow of water.

However, if each faucet has a \nsingle “blade” as its handle, then people don’t think they are ro-\ntating the handles: they think that they are pushing or pulling. To \nmaintain consistency, pulling either faucet should increase volume, \neven though this means rotating the left faucet counterclockwise \nand the right one clockwise. Although rotation direction is incon-\nsistent, pulling and pushing is consistent, which is how people \nconceptualize their actions.\nAlas, sometimes clever people are too clever for our good. Some \nwell-meaning plumbing designers have decided that consistency \nshould be ignored in favor of their own, private brand of psy-\nchology.

It fails misera-\nbly, however, when one hand is used to alternate between the two \ncontrols. Then you cannot remember which direction does what. \nOnce again, notice that this can be corrected without replacing the \nindividual faucets: just replace the handles with blades.

With the traditional dual faucet controls for hot \nand cold water, the standards should state:\n•  When the handles are round, both should rotate in the same direction \nto change water volume.\n•  When the handles are single blades, both should be pulled to change \nwater volume (which means rotating in opposite directions in the \nfaucet itself).\nOther configurations of handles are possible. Suppose the han-\ndles are mounted on a horizontal axis so that they rotate vertically. \nThen what? Would the answer differ for single blade handles and \nround ones? I leave this as an exercise for the reader.\nWhat about the evaluation problem? Feedback in the use of most \nfaucets is rapid and direct, so turning them the wrong way is easy \nto discover and correct. The evaluate-action cycle is easy to traverse. \nAs a result, the discrepancy from normal rules is often not noticed—\nunless you are in the shower and the feedback occurs when you \nscald or freeze yourself. When the faucets are far removed from the \nspout, as is the case where the faucets are located in the center of \nthe bathtub but the spouts high on an end wall, the delay between \nturning the faucets and the change in temperature can be quite long: \nI once timed a shower control to take 5 seconds. This makes setting \nthe temperature rather difficult. Turn the faucet the wrong way and \nthen dance around inside the shower while the water is scalding \nhot or freezing cold, madly turning the faucet in what you hope is \nthe correct direction, hoping the temperature will stabilize quickly. \nHere the problem comes from the properties of fluid flow—it takes \ntime for water to travel the 2 meters or so of pipe that might con-\nnect the faucets with the spout—so it is not easily remedied. But \nthe problem is exacerbated by poor design of the controls.\nNow let’s turn to the modern single-spout, single-control fau-\ncet. Technology to the rescue.

As it came closer, I could hear tire noise. After the car \nhad passed, I was asked my judgment of the sound. We repeated \nthe exercise numerous times, and each time the sound was differ-\nent. What was going on? We were evaluating sound designs for \nBMW’s new electric vehicles.\nElectric cars are extremely quiet. The only sounds they make \ncome from the tires, the air, and occasionally, from the high-pitched \nwhine of the electronics. Car lovers really like the silence.

That’s how they know when it is safe to cross. And what \nis true for the blind might also be true for anyone stepping onto \nthe street while distracted.

Alas, all too often it \nstops once a person is found to have acted inappropriately.\nTrying to find the cause of an accident sounds good but it is \nflawed for two reasons. First, most accidents do not have a single \ncause: there are usually multiple things that went wrong, multiple \nevents that, had any one of them not occurred, would have pre-\nvented the accident. This is what James Reason, the noted British \nauthority on human error, has called the “Swiss cheese model of \naccidents” (shown in Figure 5.3 of this chapter on page 208, and \ndiscussed in more detail there).\nSecond, why does the root cause analysis stop as soon as a hu-\nman error is found? If a machine stops working, we don’t stop the \nanalysis when we discover a broken part. Instead, we ask: “Why \ndid the part break? Was it an inferior part? Were the required spec-\nifications too low? Did something apply too high a load on the \npart?” We keep asking questions until we are satisfied that we \nunderstand the reasons for the failure: then we set out to remedy \nthem. We should do the same thing when we find human error: \nWe should discover what led to the error.

When \ncomplete elimination is not possible, redesign to reduce the impact.\nIt wasn’t difficult for me to suggest simple changes to procedures \nthat would have prevented most of the incidents at the utility com-\npany. It had never occurred to the committee to think of this. The \nproblem is that to have followed my recommendations would \nhave meant changing the culture from an attitude among the field \nworkers that “We are supermen: we can solve any problem, repair \nthe most complex outage. We do not make errors.” It is not possi-\nble to eliminate human error if it is thought of as a personal failure \nrather than as a sign of poor design of procedures or equipment. \nMy report to the company executives was received politely. I was \neven thanked. Several years later I contacted a friend at the com-\npany and asked what changes they had made. “No changes,” he \nsaid. “And we are still injuring people.”\nOne big problem is that the natural tendency to blame someone \nfor an error is even shared by those who made the error, who \noften agree that it was their fault. People do tend to blame them-\nselves when they do something that, after the fact, seems inex-\ncusable. “I knew better,” is a common comment by those who \nhave erred. But when someone says, “It was my fault, I knew \nbetter,” this is not a valid analysis of the problem. That doesn’t \nhelp prevent its recurrence.

When \nwe blame people, it is then difficult to convince organizations to \nrestructure the design to eliminate these problems. After all, if a \nperson is at fault, replace the person.

Because the designs focus upon the require-\nments of the system and the machines, and not upon the re-\nquirements of people. Most machines require precise commands \nand guidance, forcing people to enter numerical information per-\nfectly. But people aren’t very good at great precision. We frequently \nmake errors when asked to type or write sequences of numbers \nor letters. This is well known: so why are machines still being de-\nsigned that require such great precision, where pressing the wrong \nkey can lead to horrendous results?\nPeople are creative, constructive, exploratory beings. We are par-\nticularly good at novelty, at creating new ways of doing things, \nand at seeing new opportunities. Dull, repetitive, precise require-\nments fight against these traits.

But when things go wrong and we fail, then this same \nbehavior is blamed and punished.\nDeliberate Violations\nErrors are not the only type of human failures. Sometimes peo-\nple knowingly take risks. When the outcome is positive, they are \noften rewarded. When the result is negative, they might be pun-\nished. But how do we classify these deliberate violations of known, \nproper behavior? In the error literature, they tend to be ignored. In \nthe accident literature, they are an important component.\nDeliberate deviations play an important role in many accidents. \nThey are defined as cases where people intentionally violate pro-\ncedures and regulations. Why do they happen? Well, almost every \none of us has probably deliberately violated laws, rules, or even \nour own best judgment at times. Ever go faster than the speed \nlimit? Drive too fast in the snow or rain? Agree to do some hazard-\nous act, even while privately thinking it foolhardy to do so?\nIn many industries, the rules are written more with a goal toward \nlegal compliance than with an understanding of the work require-\nments. As a result, if workers followed the rules, they couldn’t get \ntheir jobs done. Do you sometimes prop open locked doors? Drive \nwith too little sleep? Work with co-workers even though you are ill \n(and might therefore be infectious)?\nRoutine violations occur when noncompliance is so frequent that \nit is ignored. Situational violations occur when there are special cir-\ncumstances (example: going through a red light “because no other \ncars were visible and I was late”). In some cases, the only way to \ncomplete a job might be to violate a rule or procedure.\nA major cause of violations is inappropriate rules or procedures \nthat not only invite violation but encourage it. Without the viola-\ntions, the work could not be done. Worse, when employees feel it \nnecessary to violate the rules in order to get the job done and, as a \nresult, succeed, they will probably be congratulated and rewarded. \nThis, of course, unwittingly rewards noncompliance.

The human error examined here is unintentional: \ndeliberate violations, by definition, are intentional deviations that \nare known to be risky, with the potential of doing harm.\nTwo Types of Errors: Slips and Mistakes\nMany years ago, the British psychologist James Reason and I de-\nveloped a general classification of human error. We divided human \nerror into two major categories: slips and mistakes (Figure 5.1). This \nclassification has proved to be of value for both theory and practice. \nIt is widely used in the study of error in such diverse areas as indus-\ntrial and aviation accidents, and medical errors. The discussion gets \na little technical, so I have kept technicalities to a minimum. This \ntopic is of extreme importance to design, so stick with it.\nDEFINITIONS: ERRORS, SLIPS, AND MISTAKES\nHuman error is defined as any deviance from “appropriate” be-\nhavior. The word appropriate is in quotes because in many circum-\nstances, the appropriate behavior is not known or is only deter-\nFIGURE 5.1. Classification of \nErrors. Errors have two major \nforms. Slips occur when the goal \nis correct, but the required actions \nare not done properly: the exe-\ncution is flawed. Mistakes occur \nwhen the goal or plan is wrong. \nSlips and mistakes can be further \ndivided based upon their under-\nlying causes. Memory lapses can \nlead to either slips or mistakes, \ndepending upon whether the \nmemory failure was at the highest \nlevel of cognition (mistakes) or at \nlower (subconscious) levels (slips). \nAlthough deliberate violations of \nprocedures are clearly inappropri-\nate behaviors that often lead to ac-\ncidents, these are not considered as \nerrors (see discussion in text).\n",

But still, error is defined as deviance from the \ngenerally accepted correct or appropriate behavior.\nError is the general term for all wrong actions. There are two ma-\njor classes of error: slips and mistakes, as shown in Figure 5.1; slips \nare further divided into two major classes and mistakes into three. \nThese categories of errors all have different implications for design. \nI now turn to a more detailed look at these classes of errors and \ntheir design implications.\nSLIPS\nA slip occurs when a person intends to do one action and ends up \ndoing something else. With a slip, the action performed is not the \nsame as the action that was intended.\nThere are two major classes of slips: action-based and memory-lapse. \nIn action-based slips, the wrong action is performed. In lapses, \nmemory fails, so the intended action is not done or its results not \nevaluated. Action-based slips and memory lapses can be further \nclassified according to their causes.\nExample of an action-based slip. I poured some milk into my coffee \nand then put the coffee cup into the refrigerator. This is the correct \naction applied to the wrong object.\nExample of a memory-lapse slip. I forget to turn off the gas burner on \nmy stove after cooking dinner. \nMISTAKES\nA mistake occurs when the wrong goal is established or the wrong \nplan is formed. From that point on, even if the actions are executed \nproperly they are part of the error, because the actions themselves are \ninappropriate—they are part of the wrong plan. With a mistake, the \naction that is performed matches the plan: it is the plan that is wrong.\nMistakes have three major classes: rule-based, knowledge-based, \nand memory-lapse. In a rule-based mistake, the person has appro-\npriately diagnosed the situation, but then decided upon an er-\nroneous course of action: the wrong rule is being followed. In a \nknowledge-based mistake, the problem is misdiagnosed because \n",

The same pro-\ncesses that make us creative and insightful by allowing us to see \nrelationships between apparently unrelated things, that let us leap \nto correct conclusions on the basis of partial or even faulty evi-\ndence, also lead to mistakes. Our ability to generalize from small \namounts of information helps tremendously in new situations; but \nsometimes we generalize too rapidly, classifying a new situation \nas similar to an old one when, in fact, there are significant discrep-\nancies.

Yes, his wristwatch, instead of his seatbelt.\nThe story illustrates both a memory-lapse slip and an action slip. \nThe forgetting of the briefcase is a memory-lapse slip. The unbuck-\nling of the wristwatch is an action slip, in this case a combination \nof description-similarity and capture error (described later in this \nchapter).\nMost everyday errors are slips. Intending to do one action, you \nfind yourself doing another. When a person says something clearly \nand distinctly to you, you “hear” something quite different. The \nstudy of slips is the study of the psychology of everyday errors—\nwhat Freud called “the psychopathology of everyday life.” Freud \nbelieved that slips have hidden, dark meanings, but most are ac-\ncounted for by rather simple mental mechanisms.\nAn interesting property of slips is that, paradoxically, they tend \nto occur more frequently to skilled people than to novices. Why? \nBecause slips often result from a lack of attention to the task. \nSkilled people—experts—tend to perform tasks automatically, un-\nder subconscious control. Novices have to pay considerable con-\nscious attention, resulting in a relatively low occurrence of slips.\n",

      "content": "174 The Design of Everyday Things\nSome slips result from the similarities of actions. Or an event \nin the world may automatically trigger an action. Sometimes our \nthoughts and actions may remind us of unintended actions, \nwhich we then perform. There are numerous different kinds of \naction slips, categorized by the underlying mechanisms that give \nrise to them. The three most relevant to design are:\n• capture slips\n• description-similarity slips\n• mode errors\nCAPTURE SLIPS\nI was using a copying machine, and I was counting the pages. I found \nmyself counting, “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King.” I had \nbeen playing cards recently.\nThe capture slip is defined as the situation where, instead of the \ndesired activity, a more frequently or recently performed one gets \ndone instead: it captures the activity. Capture errors require that \npart of the action sequences involved in the two activities be iden-\ntical, with one sequence being far more familiar than the other. \nAfter doing the identical part, the more frequent or more recent \nactivity continues, and the intended one does not get done. Sel-\ndom, if ever, does the unfamiliar sequence capture the familiar one. \nAll that is needed is a lapse of attention to the desired action at \nthe critical junction when the identical portions of the sequences \ndiverge into the two different activities. Capture errors are, there-\nfore, partial memory-lapse errors. Interestingly, capture errors are \nmore prevalent in experienced skilled people than in beginners, in \npart because the experienced person has automated the required \nactions and may not be paying conscious attention when the in-\ntended action deviates from the more frequent one.\nDesigners need to avoid procedures that have identical open-\ning steps but then diverge. The more experienced the workers, the \nmore likely they are to fall prey to capture. Whenever possible, \nsequences should be designed to differ from the very start.\n",

Instead he threw it in the toilet. (It wasn’t poor aim: \nthe laundry basket and toilet were in different rooms.)\nIn the slip known as a description-similarity slip, the error is to \nact upon an item similar to the target. This happens when the de-\nscription of the target is sufficiently vague. Much as we saw in \nChapter 3, Figure 3.1, where people had difficulty distinguishing \namong different images of money because their internal descrip-\ntions did not have sufficient discriminating information, the same \nthing can happen to us, especially when we are tired, stressed, or \noverloaded. In the example that opened this section, both the laun-\ndry basket and the toilet bowl are containers, and if the description \nof the target was sufficiently ambiguous, such as “a large enough \ncontainer,” the slip could be triggered.\nRemember the discussion in Chapter 3 that most objects don’t \nneed precise descriptions, simply enough precision to distinguish \nthe desired target from alternatives. This means that a description \nthat usually suffices may fail when the situation changes so that \nmultiple similar items now match the description. Description-\nsimilarity errors result in performing the correct action on the \nwrong object. Obviously, the more the wrong and right objects \nhave in common, the more likely the errors are to occur. Simi-\nlarly, the more objects present at the same time, the more likely \nthe error.\nDesigners need to ensure that controls and displays for differ-\nent purposes are significantly different from one another. A lineup \nof identical-looking switches or displays is very apt to lead to \ndescription-similarity error. In the design of airplane cockpits, \nmany controls are shape coded so that they both look and feel dif-\nferent from one another: the throttle levers are different from the \nflap levers (which might look and feel like a wing flap), which are \ndifferent from the landing gear control (which might look and feel \nlike a wheel).\n",

Consider these \nexamples:\n•  Making copies of a document, walking off with the copy, but leaving \nthe original inside the machine.\n•  Forgetting a child. This error has numerous examples, such as leaving \na child behind at a rest stop during a car trip, or in the dressing room \nof a department store, or a new mother forgetting her one-month-old \nand having to go to the police for help in finding the baby.\n•  Losing a pen because it was taken out to write something, then put \ndown while doing some other task. The pen is forgotten in the ac-\ntivities of putting away a checkbook, picking up goods, talking to a \nsalesperson or friends, and so on. Or the reverse: borrowing a pen, \nusing it, and then putting it away in your pocket or purse, even \nthough it is someone else’s (this is also a capture error).\n•  Using a bank or credit card to withdraw money from an automatic \nteller machine, then walking off without the card, is such a frequent \nerror that many machines now have a forcing function: the card must \nbe removed before the money will be delivered. Of course, it is then \npossible to walk off without the money, but this is less likely than \nforgetting the card because money is the goal of using the machine. \nMemory lapses are common causes of error. They can lead to \nseveral kinds of errors: failing to do all of the steps of a procedure; \nrepeating steps; forgetting the outcome of an action; or forgetting \nthe goal or plan, thereby causing the action to be stopped.\nThe immediate cause of most memory-lapse failures is interrup-\ntions, events that intervene between the time an action is decided \nupon and the time it is completed. Quite often the interference \ncomes from the machines we are using: the many steps required \nbetween the start and finish of the operations can overload the ca-\npacity of short-term or working memory.\nThere are several ways to combat memory-lapse errors. One is to \nminimize the number of steps; another, to provide vivid reminders \nof steps that need to be completed. A superior method is to use the \n",

For example, automated teller ma-\nchines often require removal of the bank card before delivering the \nrequested money: this prevents forgetting the bank card, capital-\nizing on the fact that people seldom forget the goal of the activity, \nin this case the money. With pens, the solution is simply to prevent \ntheir removal, perhaps by chaining public pens to the counter. Not \nall memory-lapse errors lend themselves to simple solutions. In \nmany cases the interruptions come from outside the system, where \nthe designer has no control.\nMODE-ERROR SLIPS\nA mode error occurs when a device has different states in which \nthe same controls have different meanings: we call these states \nmodes. Mode errors are inevitable in anything that has more pos-\nsible actions than it has controls or displays; that is, the controls \nmean different things in the different modes. This is unavoidable \nas we add more and more functions to our devices. \nEver turn off the wrong device in your home entertainment sys-\ntem? This happens when one control is used for multiple purposes. \nIn the home, this is simply frustrating. In industry, the confusion \nthat results when operators believe the system to be in one mode, \nwhen in reality it is in another, has resulted in serious accidents \nand loss of life.\nIt is tempting to save money and space by having a single control \nserve multiple purposes. Suppose there are ten different functions \non a device. Instead of using ten separate knobs or switches—\nwhich would take considerable space, add extra cost, and appear \nintimidatingly complex, why not use just two controls, one to select \nthe function, the other to set the function to the desired condition? \nAlthough the resulting design appears quite simple and easy to \nuse, this apparent simplicity masks the underlying complexity of \nuse. The operator must always be completely aware of the mode, of \nwhat function is active. Alas, the prevalence of mode errors shows \nthis assumption to be false.

Or, as in the case of the Airbus accident discussed be-\nlow, the two modes being selected are very similar in control \nand function, but have different operating characteristics, which \nmeans that the resulting mode error is difficult to discover? \nSometimes the use of modes is justifiable, such as the need to \nput many controls and displays in a small, restricted space, but \nwhatever the reason, modes are a common cause of confusion \nand error.\nAlarm clocks often use the same controls and display for setting \nthe time of day and the time the alarm should go off, and many \nof us have thereby set one when we meant the other. Similarly, \nwhen time is displayed on a twelve-hour scale, it is easy to set the \nalarm to go off at seven a.m. only later to discover that the alarm \nhad been set for seven p.m. The use of “a.m.” and “p.m.” to distin-\nguish times before and after noon is a common source of confu-\nsion and error, hence the common use of 24-hour time specification \nthroughout most of the world (the major exceptions being North \nAmerica, Australia, India, and the Philippines).

As automobiles become \nmore complex, with the dashboard controls for driving, heating \nand air-conditioning, entertainment, and navigation, modes are \nincreasingly common.\nAn accident with an Airbus airplane illustrates the problem. The \nflight control equipment (often referred to as the automatic pilot) \nhad two modes, one for controlling vertical speed, the other for \ncontrolling the flight path’s angle of descent. In one case, when the \npilots were attempting to land, the pilots thought that they were \ncontrolling the angle of descent, whereas they had accidentally \n",

The number \n(–3.3) that was entered into the system to represent an appropriate \nangle (–3.3º) was too steep a rate of descent when interpreted as \nvertical speed (–3,300 feet/minute: –3.3º would only be –800 feet/\nminute). This mode confusion contributed to the resulting fatal ac-\ncident. After a detailed study of the accident, Airbus changed the \ndisplay on the instrument so that vertical speed would always be \ndisplayed with a four-digit number and angle with two digits, thus \nreducing the chance of confusion.\nMode error is really design error. Mode errors are especially \nlikely where the equipment does not make the mode visible, so \nthe user is expected to remember what mode has been established, \nsometimes hours earlier, during which time many intervening \nevents might have occurred. Designers must try to avoid modes, \nbut if they are necessary, the equipment must make it obvious \nwhich mode is invoked. Once again, designers must always com-\npensate for interfering activities.\nThe Classification of Mistakes\nMistakes result from the choice of inappropriate goals and plans or \nfrom faulty comparison of the outcome with the goals during eval-\nuation. In mistakes, a person makes a poor decision, misclassifies a \nsituation, or fails to take all the relevant factors into account. Many \nmistakes arise from the vagaries of human thought, often because \npeople tend to rely upon remembered experiences rather than on \nmore systematic analysis.

Skill-based behavior occurs when work-\ners are extremely expert at their jobs, so they can do the everyday, \nroutine tasks with little or no thought or conscious attention. The \nmost common form of errors in skill-based behavior is slips.\nRule-based behavior occurs when the normal routine is no lon-\nger applicable but the new situation is one that is known, so there \nis already a well-prescribed course of action: a rule. Rules simply \nmight be learned behaviors from previous experiences, but in-\ncludes formal procedures prescribed in courses and manuals, usu-\nally in the form of “if-then” statements, such as, “If the engine will \nnot start, then do [the appropriate action].” Errors with rule-based \nbehavior can be either a mistake or a slip. If the wrong rule is se-\nlected, this would be a mistake. If the error occurs during the exe-\ncution of the rule, it is most likely a slip. \nKnowledge-based procedures occur when unfamiliar events oc-\ncur, where neither existing skills nor rules apply. In this case, there \nmust be considerable reasoning and problem-solving. Plans might \nbe developed, tested, and then used or modified. Here, conceptual \nmodels are essential in guiding development of the plan and inter-\npretation of the situation.\nIn both rule-based and knowledge-based situations, the most seri-\nous mistakes occur when the situation is misdiagnosed. As a result, \nan inappropriate rule is executed, or in the case of knowledge-based \nproblems, the effort is addressed to solving the wrong problem. In \naddition, with misdiagnosis of the problem comes misinterpreta-\ntion of the environment, as well as faulty comparisons of the cur-\nrent state with expectations. These kinds of mistakes can be very \ndifficult to detect and correct.\nRULE-BASED MISTAKES\nWhen new procedures have to be invoked or when simple prob-\nlems arise, we can characterize the actions of skilled people as rule-\nbased. Some rules come from experience; others are formal proce-\ndures in manuals or rulebooks, or even less formal guides, such \nas cookbooks for food preparation. In either case, all we must do \nis identify the situation, select the proper rule, and then follow it.\n",

Signal the intention to \nturn and move as far left as legally permitted: slow the vehicle and \nwait for a safe break in traffic, all the while following the traffic \nrules and relevant signs and lights.\nRule-based mistakes occur in multiple ways:\n•  The situation is mistakenly interpreted, thereby invoking the wrong \ngoal or plan, leading to following an inappropriate rule.\n•  The correct rule is invoked, but the rule itself is faulty, either because \nit was formulated improperly or because conditions are different \nthan assumed by the rule or through incomplete knowledge used to \ndetermine the rule. All of these lead to knowledge-based mistakes.\n•  The correct rule is invoked, but the outcome is incorrectly evaluated. \nThis error in evaluation, usually rule- or knowledge-based itself, can \nlead to further problems as the action cycle continues.\nExample 1:  In 2013, at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, Brazil, pyro-\ntechnics used by the band ignited a fire that killed over 230 people. \nThe tragedy illustrates several mistakes. The band made a knowl-\nedge-based mistake when they used outdoor flares, which ignited the \nceiling’s acoustic tiles. The band thought the flares were safe. Many \npeople rushed into the rest rooms, mistakenly thinking they were ex-\nits: they died. Early reports suggested that the guards, unaware of \nthe fire, at first mistakenly blocked people from leaving the building. \nWhy? Because nightclub attendees would sometimes leave without \npaying for their drinks.\n The mistake was in devising a rule that did not take account of \nemergencies. A root cause analysis would reveal that the goal was \nto prevent inappropriate exit but still allow the doors to be used in \nan emergency. One solution is doors that trigger alarms when used, \ndeterring people trying to sneak out, but allowing exit when needed. \nExample 2: Turning the thermostat of an oven to its maximum tempera-\nture to get it to the proper cooking temperature faster is a mistake \nbased upon a false conceptual model of the way the oven works.

The driver ap-\nplies full force to the brakes but the car skids, triggering the anti-lock \nbrakes to rapidly turn the brakes on and off, as they are designed to \ndo. The driver, feeling the vibrations, believes that it indicates mal-\nfunction and therefore lifts his foot off the brake pedal. In fact, the \nvibration is a signal that anti-lock brakes are working properly. The \ndriver’s misevaluation leads to the wrong behavior.\nRule-based mistakes are difficult to avoid and then difficult to \ndetect. Once the situation has been classified, the selection of the \nappropriate rule is often straightforward. But what if the classifica-\ntion of the situation is wrong? This is difficult to discover because \nthere is usually considerable evidence to support the erroneous \nclassification of the situation and the choice of rule.

In the face of \ntime pressures to make a decision, it is difficult to know which \nevidence to consider, which to reject.

All major decision makers worry about the complexity \nof real-world events, where the problem is often too much infor-\nmation, much of it contradictory. Often, decisions must be made \nquickly. Sometimes it isn’t even clear that there is an incident or \nthat a decision is actually being made.\nThink of it like this. In your home, there are probably a number \nof broken or misbehaving items. There might be some burnt-out \nlights, or (in my home) a reading light that works fine for a little \nwhile, then goes out: we have to walk over and wiggle the fluo-\nrescent bulb. There might be a leaky faucet or other minor faults \nthat you know about but are postponing action to remedy. Now \nconsider a major process-control manufacturing plant (an oil refin-\nery, a chemical plant, or a nuclear power plant). These have thou-\nsands, perhaps tens of thousands, of valves and gauges, displays \nand controls, and so on. Even the best of plants always has some \nfaulty parts. The maintenance crews always have a list of items to \ntake care of. With all the alarms that trigger when a problem arises, \neven though it might be minor, and all the everyday failures, how \ndoes one know which might be a significant indicator of a major \nproblem? Every single one usually has a simple, rational explana-\ntion, so not making it an urgent item is a sensible decision. In fact, \nthe maintenance crew simply adds it to a list. Most of the time, this is \nthe correct decision. The one time in a thousand (or even, one time \nin a million) that the decision is wrong makes it the one they will \nbe blamed for: how could they have missed such obvious signals? \nHindsight is always superior to foresight. When the accident in-\nvestigation committee reviews the event that contributed to the \nproblem, they know what actually happened, so it is easy for them \nto pick out which information was relevant, which was not. This is \nretrospective decision making. But when the incident was taking \nplace, the people were probably overwhelmed with far too much \nirrelevant information and probably not a lot of relevant infor-\nmation. How were they to know which to attend to and which to \nignore? Most of the time, experienced operators get things right. \nThe one time they fail, the retrospective analysis is apt to condemn \n",

I return to this topic later in the chapter.\nYou will face this while driving, while handling your finances, \nand while just going through your daily life. Most of the unusual \nincidents you read about are not relevant to you, so you can safely \nignore them. Which things should be paid attention to, which \nshould be ignored? Industry faces this problem all the time, as do \ngovernments. The intelligence communities are swamped with \ndata. How do they decide which cases are serious? The public \nhears about their mistakes, but not about the far more frequent \ncases that they got right or about the times they ignored data as not \nbeing meaningful—and were correct to do so.\nIf every decision had to be questioned, nothing would ever get \ndone. But if decisions are not questioned, there will be major \nmistakes—rarely, but often of substantial penalty.\nThe design challenge is to present the information about the state \nof the system (a device, vehicle, plant, or activities being moni-\ntored) in a way that is easy to assimilate and interpret, as well as to \nprovide alternative explanations and interpretations. It is useful \nto question decisions, but impossible to do so if every action—or \nfailure to act—requires close attention.\nThis is a difficult problem with no obvious solution.\nKNOWLEDGE-BASED MISTAKES\nKnowledge-based behavior takes place when the situation is novel \nenough that there are no skills or rules to cover it. In this case, a \nnew procedure must be devised.

In complex cases, \nhelp is needed, and here is where good cooperative problem-solving \nskills and tools are required. Sometimes, good procedural manuals \n(paper or electronic) will do the job, especially if critical observa-\ntions can be used to arrive at the relevant procedures to follow. A \nmore powerful approach is to develop intelligent computer sys-\ntems, using good search and appropriate reasoning techniques \n(artificial-intelligence decision-making and problem-solving). The \ndifficulties here are in establishing the interaction of the people with \nthe automation: human teams and automated systems have to be \nthought of as collaborative, cooperative systems. Instead, they are \noften built by assigning the tasks that machines can do to the ma-\nchines and leaving the humans to do the rest. This usually means \nthat machines do the parts that are easy for people, but when the \nproblems become complex, which is precisely when people could \nuse assistance, that is when the machines usually fail. (I discuss \nthis problem extensively in The Design of Future Things.)\nMEMORY-LAPSE MISTAKES\nMemory lapses can lead to mistakes if the memory failure leads to \nforgetting the goal or plan of action. A common cause of the lapse \nis an interruption that leads to forgetting the evaluation of the cur-\nrent state of the environment. These lead to mistakes, not slips, be-\ncause the goals and plans become wrong. Forgetting earlier evalu-\nations often means remaking the decision, sometimes erroneously. \nThe design cures for memory-lapse mistakes are the same as for \nmemory-lapse slips: ensure that all the relevant information is con-\ntinuously available. The goals, plans, and current evaluation of \nthe system are of particular importance and should be continually \navailable.

Although at first it may not seem relevant to design, it has \nstrong influence on everyday behavior. In industrial settings, social \npressures can lead to misinterpretation, mistakes, and accidents. To \nunderstand human error, it is essential to understand social pressure.\nComplex problem-solving is required when one is faced with \nknowledge-based problems. In some cases, it can take teams of peo-\nple days to understand what is wrong and the best ways to respond. \nThis is especially true of situations where mistakes have been made \nin the diagnosis of the problem. Once the mistaken diagnosis is \nmade, all information from then on is interpreted from the wrong \npoint of view. Appropriate reconsiderations might only take place \nduring team turnover, when new people come into the situation \nwith a fresh viewpoint, allowing them to form different interpreta-\ntions of the events. Sometimes just asking one or more of the team \nmembers to take a few hours’ break can lead to the same fresh anal-\nysis (although it is understandably difficult to convince someone \nwho is battling an emergency situation to stop for a few hours).\nIn commercial installations, the pressure to keep systems run-\nning is immense. Considerable money might be lost if an expen-\nsive system is shut down. Operators are often under pressure not \nto do this. The result has at times been tragic. Nuclear power plants \nare kept running longer than is safe. Airplanes have taken off be-\nfore everything was ready and before the pilots had received per-\nmission. One such incident led to the largest accident in aviation \nhistory. Although the incident happened in 1977, a long time ago, \nthe lessons learned are still very relevant today.\nIn Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, a KLM Boeing 747 crashed \nduring takeoff into a Pan American 747 that was taxiing on the \nsame runway, killing 583 people. The KLM plane had not received \nclearance to take off, but the weather was starting to get bad and \nthe crew had already been delayed for too long (even being on the \n",

And the Pan American flight should not have been on the \nrunway, but there was considerable misunderstanding between \nthe pilots and the air traffic controllers. Furthermore, the fog was \ncoming in so thickly that neither plane’s crew could see the other.\nIn the Tenerife disaster, time and economic pressures were acting \ntogether with cultural and weather conditions. The Pan American \npilots questioned their orders to taxi on the runway, but they con-\ntinued anyway. The first officer of the KLM flight voiced minor \nobjections to the captain, trying to explain that they were not yet \ncleared for takeoff (but the first officer was very junior to the cap-\ntain, who was one of KLM’s most respected pilots). All in all, a ma-\njor tragedy occurred due to a complex mixture of social pressures \nand logical explaining away of discrepant observations.\nYou may have experienced similar pressure, putting off refuel-\ning or recharging your car until it was too late and you ran out, \nsometimes in a truly inconvenient place (this has happened to me). \nWhat are the social pressures to cheat on school examinations, or \nto help others cheat? Or to not report cheating by others?

People are nor-\nmally buoyant, so they need weights to get them beneath the surface. \nWhen the water is cold, the problem is intensified because divers \nmust then wear either wet or dry suits to keep warm, and these \nsuits add buoyancy. Adjusting buoyancy is an important part of \nthe dive, so along with the weights, divers also wear air vests \ninto which they continually add or remove air so that the body is \nclose to neutral buoyancy. (As divers go deeper, increased water \npressure compresses the air in their protective suits and lungs, so \nthey become heavier: the divers need to add air to their vests to \ncompensate.)\n",

Because the \nweights are expensive, the divers didn’t want to release them. In \naddition, if the divers released the weights and then made it back \nsafely, they could never prove that the release of the weights was \nnecessary, so they would feel embarrassed, creating self-induced \nsocial pressure. Our instructor was very aware of the resulting re-\nluctance of people to take the critical step of releasing their weights \nwhen they weren’t entirely positive it was necessary. To counteract \nthis tendency, he announced that if anyone dropped the weights \nfor safety reasons, he would publicly praise the diver and replace \nthe weights at no cost to the person. This was a very persuasive \nattempt to overcome social pressures.\nSocial pressures show up continually. They are usually difficult \nto document because most people and organizations are reluctant \nto admit these factors, so even if they are discovered in the process \nof the accident investigation, the results are often kept hidden from \npublic scrutiny. A major exception is in the study of transportation \naccidents, where the review boards across the world tend to hold \nopen investigations. The US National Transportation Safety Board \n(NTSB) is an excellent example of this, and its reports are widely \nused by many accident investigators and researchers of human er-\nror (including me).\nAnother good example of social pressures comes from yet an-\nother airplane incident. In 1982 an Air Florida flight from National \nAirport, Washington, DC, crashed during takeoff into the Four-\nteenth Street Bridge over the Potomac River, killing seventy-eight \npeople, including four who were on the bridge. The plane should \nnot have taken off because there was ice on the wings, but it had al-\nready been delayed for over an hour and a half; this and other fac-\ntors, the NTSB reported, “may have predisposed the crew to hurry.” \nThe accident occurred despite the first officer’s attempt to warn \nthe captain, who was flying the airplane (the captain and first \nofficer—sometimes called the copilot—usually alternate flying \n",

The NTSB report quotes the flight \ndeck recorder’s documenting that “although the first officer ex-\npressed concern that something ‘was not right’ to the captain four \ntimes during the takeoff, the captain took no action to reject the \ntakeoff.” NTSB summarized the causes this way:\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable \ncause of this accident was the flight crew’s failure to use engine anti-\nice during ground operation and takeoff, their decision to take off with \nsnow/ice on the airfoil surfaces of the aircraft, and the captain’s failure \nto reject the takeoff during the early stage when his attention was called \nto anomalous engine instrument readings. (NTSB, 1982.)\nAgain we see social pressures coupled with time and economic \nforces.\nSocial pressures can be overcome, but they are powerful and per-\nvasive. We drive when drowsy or after drinking, knowing full well \nthe dangers, but talking ourselves into believing that we are ex-\nempt. How can we overcome these kinds of social problems? Good \ndesign alone is not sufficient. We need different training; we need \nto reward safety and put it above economic pressures. It helps if \nthe equipment can make the potential dangers visible and explicit, \nbut this is not always possible. To adequately address social, eco-\nnomic, and cultural pressures and to improve upon company pol-\nicies are the hardest parts of ensuring safe operation and behavior.\nCHECKLISTS\nChecklists are powerful tools, proven to increase the accuracy of \nbehavior and to reduce error, particularly slips and memory lapses. \nThey are especially important in situations with multiple, complex \nrequirements, and even more so where there are interruptions. \nWith multiple people involved in a task, it is essential that the lines \nof responsibility be clearly spelled out.

The person following the checklist, feel-\ning confident that any errors would be caught, might do the steps \ntoo quickly. But the same bias affects the checker. Confident in the \nability of the first person, the checker often does a quick, less than \nthorough job.\nOne paradox of groups is that quite often, adding more people \nto check a task makes it less likely that it will be done right. Why? \nWell, if you were responsible for checking the correct readings on \na row of fifty gauges and displays, but you know that two peo-\nple before you had checked them and that one or two people who \ncome after you will check your work, you might relax, thinking \nthat you don’t have to be extra careful.

But if everyone thinks the same way, adding more \nchecks can actually increase the chance of error. A collaboratively \nfollowed checklist is an effective way to counteract these natural \nhuman tendencies.\nIn commercial aviation, collaboratively followed checklists are \nwidely accepted as essential tools for safety. The checklist is done \nby two people, usually the two pilots of the airplane (the captain \nand first officer). In aviation, checklists have proven their worth \nand are now required in all US commercial flights.

Moreover, when two people are involved, a ju-\nnior person (in aviation, the first officer) is being asked to watch \nover the action of the senior person. This is a strong violation of the \nlines of authority in many cultures.\nPhysicians and other medical professionals have strongly resisted \nthe use of checklists. It is seen as an insult to their professional \ncompetence. “Other people might need checklists,” they complain, \n“but not me.” Too bad.

Fortunately, checklists \nare slowly starting to gain acceptance in medical situations. When \nsenior personnel insist on the use of checklists, it actually enhances \ntheir authority and professional status. It took decades for check-\nlists to be accepted in commercial aviation: let us hope that medi-\ncine and other professions will change more rapidly.\nDesigning an effective checklist is difficult. The design needs to be \niterative, always being refined, ideally using the human-centered \ndesign principles of Chapter 6, continually adjusting the list until it \ncovers the essential items yet is not burdensome to perform. Many \npeople who object to checklists are actually objecting to badly de-\nsigned lists: designing a checklist for a complex task is best done by \nprofessional designers in conjunction with subject matter experts.\nPrinted checklists have one major flaw: they force the steps to \nfollow a sequential ordering, even where this is not necessary or \neven possible. With complex tasks, the order in which many oper-\nations are performed may not matter, as long as they are all com-\npleted. Sometimes items early in the list cannot be done at the time \nthey are encountered in the checklist. For example, in aviation one \nof the steps is to check the amount of fuel in the plane. But what if \nthe fueling operation has not yet been completed when this check-\nlist item is encountered? Pilots will skip over it, intending to come \nback to it after the plane has been refueled. This is a clear opportu-\nnity for a memory-lapse error.\nIn general, it is bad design to impose a sequential structure to task \nexecution unless the task itself requires it.

Poka-yoke \ntranslates as “error proofing” or “avoiding error.” One of the tech-\nniques of poka-yoke is to add simple fixtures, jigs, or devices to \nconstrain the operations so that they are correct. I practice this my-\nself in my home. One trivial example is a device to help me remem-\nber which way to turn the key on the many doors in the apartment \ncomplex where I live. I went around with a pile of small, circular, \ngreen stick-on dots and put them on each door beside its keyhole, \nwith the green dot indicating the direction in which the key needed \nto be turned: I added signifiers to the doors. Is this a major error? \nNo. But eliminating it has proven to be convenient. (Neighbors \nhave commented on their utility, wondering who put them there.)\nIn manufacturing facilities, poka-yoke might be a piece of wood \nto help align a part properly, or perhaps plates designed with \nasymmetrical screw holes so that the plate could fit in only one po-\nsition. Covering emergency or critical switches with a cover to pre-\nvent accidental triggering is another poka-yoke technique: this is \nobviously a forcing function. All the poka-yoke techniques involve \na combination of the principles discussed in this book: affordances, \nsignifiers, mapping, and constraints, and perhaps most important \nof all, forcing functions.\nNASA’S AVIATION SAFETY REPORTING SYSTEM\nUS commercial aviation has long had an extremely effective sys-\ntem for encouraging pilots to submit reports of errors. The pro-\ngram has resulted in numerous improvements to aviation safety. \nIt wasn’t easy to establish: pilots had severe self-induced social \npressures against admitting to errors. Moreover, to whom would \nthey report them? Certainly not to their employers. Not even to the \nFederal Aviation Authority (FAA), for then they would probably \nbe punished. The solution was to let the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration (NASA) set up a voluntary accident report-\ning system whereby pilots could submit semi-anonymous reports \n",

Once \nNASA personnel had acquired the necessary information, they \nwould detach the contact information from the report and mail it \nback to the pilot. This meant that NASA no longer knew who had \nreported the error, which made it impossible for the airline com-\npanies or the FAA (which enforced penalties against errors) to find \nout who had submitted the report. If the FAA had independently \nnoticed the error and tried to invoke a civil penalty or certificate \nsuspension, the receipt of self-report automatically exempted the \npilot from punishment (for minor infractions).\nWhen a sufficient number of similar errors had been collected, \nNASA would analyze them and issue reports and recommenda-\ntions to the airlines and to the FAA. These reports also helped \nthe pilots realize that their error reports were valuable tools for \nincreasing safety. As with checklists, we need similar systems in \nthe field of medicine, but it has not been easy to set up. NASA is a \nneutral body, charged with enhancing aviation safety, but has no \noversight authority, which helped gain the trust of pilots. There is \nno comparable institution in medicine: physicians are afraid that \nself-reported errors might lead them to lose their license or be sub-\njected to lawsuits. But we can’t eliminate errors unless we know \nwhat they are. The medical field is starting to make progress, but it \nis a difficult technical, political, legal, and social problem.\nDetecting Error\nErrors do not necessarily lead to harm if they are discovered \nquickly. The different categories of errors have differing ease of \ndiscovery. In general, action slips are relatively easy to discover; \nmistakes, much more difficult. Action slips are relatively easy to \ndetect because it is usually easy to notice a discrepancy between \nthe intended act and the one that got performed. But this detection \ncan only take place if there is feedback. If the result of the action is \nnot visible, how can the error be detected?\n",

With a memory slip, the required action is not \nperformed. When no action is done, there is nothing to detect. It is \nonly when the lack of action allows some unwanted event to occur \nthat there is hope of detecting a memory-lapse slip.\nMistakes are difficult to detect because there is seldom anything \nthat can signal an inappropriate goal. And once the wrong goal or \nplan is decided upon, the resulting actions are consistent with that \nwrong goal, so careful monitoring of the actions not only fails to de-\ntect the erroneous goal, but, because the actions are done correctly, \ncan inappropriately provide added confidence to the decision.\nFaulty diagnoses of a situation can be surprisingly difficult to \ndetect.

Most major accidents are preceded by warning signs: \nequipment malfunctions or unusual events. Often, there is a series \nof apparently unrelated breakdowns and errors that culminate in \nmajor disaster. Why didn’t anyone notice? Because no single in-\ncident appeared to be serious. Often, the people involved noted \neach problem but discounted it, finding a logical explanation for \nthe otherwise deviant observation.\nT HE CASE OF T HE W RONG T U R N ON A HIGH WAY\nI’ve misinterpreted highway signs, as I’m sure most drivers have. \nMy family was traveling from San Diego to Mammoth Lakes, Cal-\nifornia, a ski area about 400 miles north. As we drove, we noticed \nmore and more signs advertising the hotels and gambling casinos \nof Las Vegas, Nevada. “Strange,” we said, “Las Vegas always did \nadvertise a long way off—there is even a billboard in San Diego—\nbut this seems excessive, advertising on the road to Mammoth.” \nWe stopped for gasoline and continued on our journey. Only later, \nwhen we tried to find a place to eat supper, did we discover that we \nhad missed a turn nearly two hours earlier, before we had stopped \nfor gasoline, and that we were actually on the road to Las Vegas, \nnot the road to Mammoth. We had to backtrack the entire two-\nhour segment, wasting four hours of driving. It’s humorous now; \nit wasn’t then.\nOnce people find an explanation for an apparent anomaly, they \ntend to believe they can now discount it. But explanations are \nbased on analogy with past experiences, experiences that may not \napply to the current situation. In the driving story, the prevalence \nof billboards for Las Vegas was a signal we should have heeded, \nbut it seemed easily explained. Our experience is typical: some \nmajor industrial incidents have resulted from false explanations of \nanomalous events. But do note: usually these apparent anomalies \nshould be ignored.

Distinguishing a true anomaly from an apparent \none is difficult.\nIN HINDSIGHT, EVENTS SEEM LOGICAL\nThe contrast in our understanding before and after an event can be \ndramatic. The psychologist Baruch Fischhoff has studied explana-\ntions given in hindsight, where events seem completely obvious and \npredictable after the fact but completely unpredictable beforehand.\nFischhoff presented people with a number of situations and \nasked them to predict what would happen: they were correct only \nat the chance level. When the actual outcome was not known by the \npeople being studied, few predicted the actual outcome. He then \npresented the same situations along with the actual outcomes to \nanother group of people, asking them to state how likely each out-\ncome was: when the actual outcome was known, it appeared to be \nplausible and likely and other outcomes appeared unlikely.\nHindsight makes events seem obvious and predictable. Foresight \nis difficult. During an incident, there are never clear clues. Many \nthings are happening at once: workload is high, emotions and \nstress levels are high. Many things that are happening will turn \nout to be irrelevant. Things that appear irrelevant will turn out \nto be critical. The accident investigators, working with hindsight, \nknowing what really happened, will focus on the relevant infor-\nmation and ignore the irrelevant. But at the time the events were \nhappening, the operators did not have information that allowed \nthem to distinguish one from the other.\nThis is why the best accident analyses can take a long time to \ndo. The investigators have to imagine themselves in the shoes of \nthe people who were involved and consider all the information, \nall the training, and what the history of similar past events would \nhave taught the operators. So, the next time a major accident oc-\ncurs, ignore the initial reports from journalists, politicians, and \nexecutives who don’t have any substantive information but feel \ncompelled to provide statements anyway. Wait until the official \nreports come from trusted sources. Unfortunately, this could be \nmonths or years after the accident, and the public usually wants \n",

Moreover, \nwhen the full story finally appears, newspapers will no longer con-\nsider it news, so they won’t report it. You will have to search for \nthe official report. In the United States, the National Transportation \nSafety Board (NTSB) can be trusted. NTSB conducts careful inves-\ntigations of all major aviation, automobile and truck, train, ship, \nand pipeline incidents. (Pipelines? Sure: pipelines transport coal, \ngas, and oil.)\nDesigning for Error\nIt is relatively easy to design for the situation where everything \ngoes well, where people use the device in the way that was in-\ntended, and no unforeseen events occur. The tricky part is to de-\nsign for when things go wrong.\nConsider a conversation between two people. Are errors made? \nYes, but they are not treated as such. If a person says something \nthat is not understandable, we ask for clarification. If a person says \nsomething that we believe to be false, we question and debate. We \ndon’t issue a warning signal. We don’t beep. We don’t give error \nmessages. We ask for more information and engage in mutual dia-\nlogue to reach an understanding. In normal conversations between \ntwo friends, misstatements are taken as normal, as approximations \nto what was really meant. Grammatical errors, self-corrections, and \nrestarted phrases are ignored. In fact, they are usually not even \ndetected because we concentrate upon the intended meaning, not \nthe surface features.\nMachines are not intelligent enough to determine the meaning \nof our actions, but even so, they are far less intelligent than they \ncould be. With our products, if we do something inappropriate, \nif the action fits the proper format for a command, the product \ndoes it, even if it is outrageously dangerous. This has led to tragic \naccidents, especially in health care, where inappropriate design of \ninfusion pumps and X-ray machines allowed extreme overdoses \nof medication or radiation to be administered to patients, leading \nto their deaths. In financial institutions, simple keyboard errors \nhave led to huge financial transactions, far beyond normal limits. \n",

(This is discussed at the end of the chapter under the \nheading “Sensibility Checks.”)\nMany systems compound the problem by making it easy to err \nbut difficult or impossible to discover error or to recover from it. \nIt should not be possible for one simple error to cause widespread \ndamage. Here is what should be done:\n•  Understand the causes of error and design to minimize those causes.\n•  Do sensibility checks. Does the action pass the “common sense” test?\n•  Make it possible to reverse actions—to “undo” them—or make it \nharder to do what cannot be reversed.\n•  Make it easier for people to discover the errors that do occur, and \nmake them easier to correct.\n•  Don’t treat the action as an error; rather, try to help the person com-\nplete the action properly. Think of the action as an approximation to \nwhat is desired.\nAs this chapter demonstrates, we know a lot about errors. Thus, \nnovices are more likely to make mistakes than slips, whereas experts \nare more likely to make slips. Mistakes often arise from ambiguous \nor unclear information about the current state of a system, the lack \nof a good conceptual model, and inappropriate procedures. Recall \nthat most mistakes result from erroneous choice of goal or plan or \nerroneous evaluation and interpretation. All of these come about \nthrough poor information provided by the system about the choice \nof goals and the means to accomplish them (plans), and poor-quality \nfeedback about what has actually happened.\nA major source of error, especially memory-lapse errors, is in-\nterruption. When an activity is interrupted by some other event, \nthe cost of the interruption is far greater than the loss of the time \nrequired to deal with the interruption: it is also the cost of resuming \nthe interrupted activity. To resume, it is necessary to remember pre-\ncisely the previous state of the activity: what the goal was, where \none was in the action cycle, and the relevant state of the system. \nMost systems make it difficult to resume after an interruption. \n",

Interruptions \nand distractions lead to errors, both mistakes and slips.\nWarning signals are usually not the answer. Consider the control \nroom of a nuclear power plant, the cockpit of a commercial aircraft, \nor the operating room of a hospital. Each has a large number of \ndifferent instruments, gauges, and controls, all with signals that \ntend to sound similar because they all use simple tone generators \nto beep their warnings. There is no coordination among the instru-\nments, which means that in major emergencies, they all sound at \nonce.

In general, the solutions fol-\nlow directly from the preceding analyses.\nADDING CONST R A IN TS TO BLOC K ER RORS\nPrevention often involves adding specific constraints to actions. In \nthe physical world, this can be done through clever use of shape \nand size. For example, in automobiles, a variety of fluids are re-\nquired for safe operation and maintenance: engine oil, transmis-\nsion oil, brake fluid, windshield washer solution, radiator coolant, \nbattery water, and gasoline. Putting the wrong fluid into a reser-\nvoir could lead to serious damage or even an accident. Automobile \nmanufacturers try to minimize these errors by segregating the fill-\ning points, thereby reducing description-similarity errors. When \nthe filling points for fluids that should be added only occasion-\nally or by qualified mechanics are located separately from those \nfor fluids used more frequently, the average motorist is unlikely \nto use the incorrect filling points. Errors in adding fluids to the \nwrong container can be minimized by making the openings have \ndifferent sizes and shapes, providing physical constraints against \ninappropriate filling. Different fluids often have different colors so \nthat they can be distinguished. All these are excellent ways to min-\nimize errors. Similar techniques are in widespread use in hospitals \nand industry. All of these are intelligent applications of constraints, \nforcing functions, and poka-yoke.\n",

Of course, it is because of errors of this sort that the \nUndo command is so important.

The information processing structures of the brain automat-\nically regulate how much conscious attention is being paid to a \ntask: conversations automatically pause when crossing the street \namid busy traffic. Don’t count on it, though: if too much attention \nis focused on something else, the fact that the traffic is getting dan-\ngerous might not be noted.\nMany slips can be minimized by ensuring that the actions and \ntheir controls are as dissimilar as possible, or at least, as physically \nfar apart as possible. Mode errors can be eliminated by the simple \nexpedient of eliminating most modes and, if this is not possible, \nby making the modes very visible and distinct from one another.\nThe best way of mitigating slips is to provide perceptible feed-\nback about the nature of the action being performed, then very \nperceptible feedback describing the new resulting state, coupled \nwith a mechanism that allows the error to be undone. For example, \nthe use of machine-readable codes has led to a dramatic reduction \nin the delivery of wrong medications to patients. Prescriptions sent \nto the pharmacy are given electronic codes, so the pharmacist can \nscan both the prescription and the resulting medication to ensure \nthey are the same. Then, the nursing staff at the hospital scans both \nthe label of the medication and the tag worn around the patient’s \nwrist to ensure that the medication is being given to the correct \nindividual. Moreover, the computer system can flag repeated ad-\nministration of the same medication. These scans do increase the \nworkload, but only slightly. Other kinds of errors are still possible, \nbut these simple steps have already been proven worthwhile.\nCommon engineering and design practices seem as if they are \ndeliberately intended to cause slips. Rows of identical controls or \nmeters is a sure recipe for description-similarity errors. Internal \nmodes that are not very conspicuously marked are a clear driver \nof mode errors. Situations with numerous interruptions, yet where \nthe design assumes undivided attention, are a clear enabler of \nmemory lapses—and almost no equipment today is designed to \nsupport the numerous interruptions that so many situations en-\ntail.

Design can save lives.\nTHE SWISS CHEESE MODEL OF \nHOW ERRORS LEAD TO ACCIDENTS\nFortunately, most errors do not lead to accidents. Accidents often \nhave numerous contributing causes, no single one of which is the \nroot cause of the incident.\nJames Reason likes to explain this by invoking the metaphor of \nmultiple slices of Swiss cheese, the cheese famous for being riddled \nwith holes (Figure 5.3). If each slice of cheese represents a condi-\ntion in the task being done, an accident can happen only if holes \nin all four slices of cheese are lined up just right. In well-designed \nsystems, there can be many equipment failures, many errors, but \nthey will not lead to an accident unless they all line up precisely. \nAny leakage—passageway through a hole—is most likely blocked \nat the next level. Well-designed systems are resilient against failure.\nThis is why the attempt to find \n“the” cause of an accident is usually \ndoomed to fail. Accident investiga-\ntors, the press, government officials, \nand the everyday citizen like to find \nsimple explanations for the cause of \nan accident. “See, if the hole in slice A \nFIGURE 5.3. Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model of Accidents. Accidents usually have \nmultiple causes, whereby had any single one of those causes not happened, the acci-\ndent would not have occurred. The British accident researcher James Reason describes \nthis through the metaphor of slices of Swiss cheese: unless the holes all line up per-\nfectly, there will be no accident. This metaphor provides two lessons: First, do not try \nto find “the” cause of an accident; Second, we can decrease accidents and make sys-\ntems more resilient by designing them to have extra precautions against error (more \nslices of cheese), less opportunities for slips, mistakes, or equipment failure (less holes), \nand very different mechanisms in the different subparts of the system (trying to en-\nsure that the holes do not line up).

So \nthrow away slice A and replace it.” Of course, the same can be said \nfor slices B, C, and D (and in real accidents, the number of cheese \nslices would sometimes measure in the tens or hundreds). It is rel-\natively easy to find some action or decision that, had it been dif-\nferent, would have prevented the accident. But that does not mean \nthat this was the cause of the accident. It is only one of the many \ncauses: all the items have to line up.\nYou can see this in most accidents by the “if only” statements. \n“If only I hadn’t decided to take a shortcut, I wouldn’t have had \nthe accident.” “If only it hadn’t been raining, my brakes would \nhave worked.” “If only I had looked to the left, I would have seen \nthe car sooner.” Yes, all those statements are true, but none of them \nis “the” cause of the accident. Usually, there is no single cause. \nYes, journalists and lawyers, as well as the public, like to know \nthe cause so someone can be blamed and punished. But reputable \ninvestigating agencies know that there is not a single cause, which \nis why their investigations take so long. Their responsibility is to \nunderstand the system and make changes that would reduce the \nchance of the same sequence of events leading to a future accident.\nThe Swiss cheese metaphor suggests several ways to reduce \naccidents:\n•  Add more slices of cheese.\n•  Reduce the number of holes (or make the existing holes smaller).\n•  Alert the human operators when several holes have lined up.\nEach of these has operational implications. More slices of cheese \nmeans mores lines of defense, such as the requirement in aviation and \nother industries for checklists, where one person reads the items, \nanother does the operation, and the first person checks the opera-\ntion to confirm it was done appropriately.\nReducing the number of critical safety points where error can \noccur is like reducing the number or size of the holes in the Swiss \ncheese. Properly designed equipment will reduce the opportunity \nfor slips and mistakes, which is like reducing the number of holes \n",

All require instructional courses and tests. \nIn aviation, it isn’t sufficient to be trained: pilots must also keep \nin practice by flying some minimum number of hours per month.\nDrunk driving is still a major cause of automobile accidents: this \nis clearly the fault of the drinker. Lack of sleep is another major \nculprit in vehicle accidents. But because people occasionally are \nat fault does not justify the attitude that assumes they are always \nat fault.

In either case, \nthe question is how to design and manage these systems so that \nthey can restore services with a minimum of disruption and dam-\nage. An important approach is resilience engineering, with the goal \nof designing systems, procedures, management, and the training \nof people so they are able to respond to problems as they arise. It \nstrives to ensure that the design of all these things—the equipment, \nprocedures, and communication both among workers and also ex-\nternally to management and the public—are continually being as-\nsessed, tested, and improved.\nThus, major computer providers can deliberately cause errors in \ntheir systems to test how well the company can respond. This is done \nby deliberately shutting down critical facilities to ensure that the \nbackup systems and redundancies actually work. Although it might \nseem dangerous to do this while the systems are online, serving real \ncustomers, the only way to test these large, complex systems is by do-\ning so. Small tests and simulations do not carry the complexity, stress \nlevels, and unexpected events that characterize real system failures.\nAs Erik Hollnagel, David Woods, and Nancy Leveson, the au-\nthors of an early influential series of books on the topic, have skill-\nfully summarized:\nResilience engineering is a paradigm for safety management that fo-\ncuses on how to help people cope with complexity under pressure to \nachieve success. It strongly contrasts with what is typical today—a \nparadigm of tabulating error as if it were a thing, followed by interven-\ntions to reduce this count. A resilient organisation treats safety as a core \nvalue, not a commodity that can be counted. Indeed, safety shows itself \nonly by the events that do not happen! Rather than view past success \nas a reason to ramp down investments, such organisations continue to \ninvest in anticipating the changing potential for failure because they \nappreciate that their knowledge of the gaps is imperfect and that their \nenvironment constantly changes.

(Reprinted by permission of the publishers. \nHollnagel, Woods, & Leveson, 2006, p. 6.)\nThe Paradox of Automation\nMachines are getting smarter. More and more tasks are becoming \nfully automated. As this happens, there is a tendency to believe \nthat many of the difficulties involved with human control will go \naway. Across the world, automobile accidents kill and injure tens \nof millions of people every year. When we finally have widespread \nadoption of self-driving cars, the accident and casualty rate will \nprobably be dramatically reduced, just as automation in factories \nand aviation have increased efficiency while lowering both error \nand the rate of injury.\nWhen automation works, it is wonderful, but when it fails, the \nresulting impact is usually unexpected and, as a result, danger-\nous. Today, automation and networked electrical generation sys-\ntems have dramatically reduced the amount of time that electrical \npower is not available to homes and businesses. But when the elec-\ntrical power grid goes down, it can affect huge sections of a coun-\ntry and take many days to recover. With self-driving cars, I predict \nthat we will have fewer accidents and injuries, but that when there \nis an accident, it will be huge.\nAutomation keeps getting more and more capable. Automatic \nsystems can take over tasks that used to be done by people, \nwhether it is maintaining the proper temperature, automatically \nkeeping an automobile within its assigned lane at the correct \ndistance from the car in front, enabling airplanes to fly by them-\nselves from takeoff to landing, or allowing ships to navigate by \nthemselves. When the automation works, the tasks are usually \ndone as well as or better than by people. Moreover, it saves peo-\nple from the dull, dreary routine tasks, allowing more useful, \nproductive use of time, reducing fatigue and error. But when \nthe task gets too complex, automation tends to give up. This, of \ncourse, is precisely when it is needed the most. The paradox is \nthat automation can take over the dull, dreary tasks, but fail with \nthe complex ones.\n",

This is \na situation I have documented very thoroughly in my other books \nand many of my papers, as have many other people in the field of \nsafety and automation. When the failure occurs, the human is “out \nof the loop.” This means that the person has not been paying much \nattention to the operation, and it takes time for the failure to be \nnoticed and evaluated, and then to decide how to respond.\nIn an airplane, when the automation fails, there is usually con-\nsiderable time for the pilots to understand the situation and re-\nspond. Airplanes fly quite high: over 10 km (6 miles) above the \nearth, so even if the plane were to start falling, the pilots might \nhave several minutes to respond. Moreover, pilots are extremely \nwell trained. When automation fails in an automobile, the person \nmight have only a fraction of a second to avoid an accident. This \nwould be extremely difficult even for the most expert driver, and \nmost drivers are not well trained.\nIn other circumstances, such as ships, there may be more time \nto respond, but only if the failure of the automation is noticed. In \none dramatic case, the grounding of the cruise ship Royal Majesty in \n1997, the failure lasted for several days and was only detected in the \npostaccident investigation, after the ship had run aground, causing \nseveral million dollars in damage. What happened? The ship’s lo-\ncation was normally determined by the Global Positioning System \n(GPS), but the cable that connected the satellite antenna to the nav-\nigation system somehow had become disconnected (nobody ever \ndiscovered how). As a result, the navigation system had switched \nfrom using GPS signals to “dead reckoning,” approximating the \nship’s location by estimating speed and direction of travel, but the \ndesign of the navigation system didn’t make this apparent. As a re-\nsult, as the ship traveled from Bermuda to its destination of Boston, \nit went too far south and went aground on Cape Cod, a peninsula \njutting out of the water south of Boston. The automation had per-\nformed flawlessly for years, which increased people’s trust and re-\nliance upon it, so the normal manual checking of location or careful \nperusal of the display (to see the tiny letters “dr” indicating “dead \nreckoning” mode) were not done.

Machines are rigid, pre-\ncise, and relatively fixed in their operations. There is a mismatch \nbetween the two, one that can lead to enhanced capability if used \nproperly. Think of an electronic calculator. It doesn’t do mathemat-\nics like a person, but can solve problems people can’t. Moreover, \ncalculators do not make errors. So the human plus calculator is a \nperfect collaboration: we humans figure out what the important \nproblems are and how to state them. Then we use calculators to \ncompute the solutions. \nDifficulties arise when we do not think of people and machines \nas collaborative systems, but assign whatever tasks can be auto-\nmated to the machines and leave the rest to people. This ends up \nrequiring people to behave in machine like fashion, in ways that \ndiffer from human capabilities. We expect people to monitor ma-\nchines, which means keeping alert for long periods, something we \nare bad at. We require people to do repeated operations with the \nextreme precision and accuracy required by machines, again some-\nthing we are not good at. When we divide up the machine and \nhuman components of a task in this way, we fail to take advantage \nof human strengths and capabilities but instead rely upon areas \nwhere we are genetically, biologically unsuited. Yet, when people \nfail, they are blamed.\nWhat we call “human error” is often simply a human action that \nis inappropriate for the needs of technology. As a result, it flags a \ndeficit in our technology. It should not be thought of as error. We \nshould eliminate the concept of error: instead, we should realize \nthat people can use assistance in translating their goals and plans \ninto the appropriate form for technology.\nGiven the mismatch between human competencies and tech-\nnological requirements, errors are inevitable. Therefore, the best \ndesigns take that fact as given and seek to minimize the opportu-\nnities for errors while also mitigating the consequences.

Most important of all is that \nthe process be iterative and expansive. Designers resist the temp-\ntation to jump immediately to a solution for the stated problem. \nInstead, they first spend time determining what basic, fundamen-\ntal (root) issue needs to be addressed.

But you can sympathize with a product manager \nwho, having given the designers a problem to solve, finds them \nquestioning the assignment and insisting on traveling all over \nthe world to seek deeper understanding. Even when the design-\ners start focusing upon the problem, they do not seem to make \nprogress, but instead develop a wide variety of ideas and thoughts, \nmany only half-formed, many clearly impractical. All this can be \nrather unsettling to the product manager who, concerned about \nmeeting the schedule, wants to see immediate convergence. To add \nto the frustration of the product manager, as the designers start to \nconverge upon a solution, they may realize that they have inap-\npropriately formulated the problem, so the entire process must be \nrepeated (although it can go more quickly this time).\nThis repeated divergence and convergence is important in prop-\nerly determining the right problem to be solved and then the best \nway to solve it. It looks chaotic and ill-structured, but it actually \nfollows well-established principles and procedures. How does \nthe product manager keep the entire team on schedule despite the \napparent random and divergent methods of designers? Encourage \ntheir free exploration, but hold them to the schedule (and budget) \nconstraints. There is nothing like a firm deadline to get creative \nminds to reach convergence.\nThe Human-Centered Design Process\nThe double-diamond describes the two phases of design: finding \nthe right problem and fulfilling human needs. But how are these \nactually done? This is where the human-centered design pro-\ncess comes into play: it takes place within the double-diamond \ndiverge-converge process.\nThere are four different activities in the human-centered design \nprocess (Figure 6.2):\n",

Now let us examine \neach activity separately.\nOBSERVATION\nThe initial research to understand \nthe nature of the problem itself is \npart of the discipline of design re-\nsearch. Note that this is research \nabout the customer and the people \nwho will use the products under consideration. It is not the kind \nof research that scientists do in their laboratories, trying to find \nnew laws of nature. The design researcher will go to the potential \ncustomers, observing their activities, attempting to understand \ntheir interests, motives, and true needs. The problem definition \nfor the product design will come from this deep understanding of \nthe goals the people are trying to accomplish and the impediments \nthey experience. One of its most critical techniques is to observe the \nwould-be customers in their natural environment, in their normal \nlives, wherever the product or service being designed will actually \nbe used. Watch them in their homes, schools, and offices. Watch \nthem commute, at parties, at mealtime, and with friends at the local \nbar. Follow them into the shower if necessary, because it is essential \nto understand the real situations that they encounter, not some pure \nisolated experience. This technique is called applied ethnography, a \nmethod adapted from the field of anthropology. Applied ethnog-\nraphy differs from the slower, more methodical, research-oriented \npractice of academic anthropologists because the goals are different. \nFIGURE 6.2. The Iterative Cycle \nof Human-Centered Design. Make \nobservations on the intended tar-\nget population, generate ideas, \nproduce prototypes and test them. \nRepeat until satisfied.

For another, \nproduct cycles are driven by schedule and budget, both of which \nrequire more rapid assessment than is typical in academic studies \nthat might go on for years.\nIt’s important that the people being observed match those of the \nintended audience. Note that traditional measures of people, such \nas age, education, and income, are not always important: what \nmatters most are the activities to be performed. Even when we \nlook at widely different cultures, the activities are often surpris-\ningly similar. As a result, the studies can focus upon the activi-\nties and how they get done, while being sensitive to how the local \nenvironment and culture might modify those activities. In some \ncases, such as the products widely used in business, the activity \ndominates. Thus, automobiles, computers, and phones are pretty \nstandardized across the world because their designs reflect the ac-\ntivities being supported.\nIn some cases, detailed analyses of the intended group are nec-\nessary.

This is where teenagers \nin one culture differ from those of another, and even from younger \nchildren and older adults of the same culture. Design researchers \nmust carefully adjust the focus of their observations to the intended \nmarket and people for whom the product is intended.\nWill the product be used in some country other than where it is \nbeing designed? There is only one way to find out: go there (and \nalways include natives in the team). Don’t take a shortcut and \nstay home, talking to students or visitors from that country while \nremaining in your own: what you will learn is seldom an accu-\nrate reflection of the target population or of the ways in which the \nproposed product will actually be used.

Marketing wants to know what people will \nbuy, which includes learning how they make their purchasing de-\ncisions. These different aims lead the two groups to develop dif-\nferent methods of inquiry. Designers tend to use qualitative ob-\nservational methods by which they can study people in depth, \nunderstanding how they do their activities and the environmental \nfactors that come into play. These methods are very time consum-\ning, so designers typically only examine small numbers of people, \noften numbering in the tens.\nMarketing is concerned with customers. Who might possibly \npurchase the item? What factors might entice them to consider \nand purchase a product? Marketing traditionally uses large-scale, \nquantitative studies, with heavy reliance on focus groups, surveys, \nand questionnaires. In marketing, it is not uncommon to converse \nwith hundreds of people in focus groups, and to question tens of \nthousands of people by means of questionnaires and surveys.\nThe advent of the Internet and the ability to assess huge \namounts of data have given rise to new methods of formal, quan-\ntitative market analysis. “Big data,” it is called, or sometimes \n“market analytics.” For popular websites, A/B testing is possible \nin which two potential variants of an offering are tested by giving \n",

Designers counter with the observation that traditional \nmarketing methods provide shallow insight into a large number \nof people.\nThe debate is not useful. All groups are necessary.

These are not the same things, which is why \nboth approaches are required: marketing and design researchers \nshould work together in complementary teams.\nWhat are the requirements for a successful product? First, if no-\nbody buys the product, then all else is irrelevant. The product de-\nsign has to provide support for all the factors people use in making \npurchase decisions. Second, once the product has been purchased \nand is put into use, it must support real needs so that people can \nuse, understand, and take pleasure from it.

This exercise might be done for \nboth of the double diamonds: during the phase of finding the cor-\nrect problem, then during the problem solution phase.\nThis is the fun part of design: it is where creativity is critical. \nThere are many ways of generating ideas: many of these methods \nfall under the heading of “brainstorming.” Whatever the method \nused, two major rules are usually followed:\n•  Generate numerous ideas. It is dangerous to become fixated upon \none or two ideas too early in the process.\n•  Be creative without regard for constraints. Avoid criticizing ideas, \nwhether your own or those of others. Even crazy ideas, often obvi-\nously wrong, can contain creative insights that can later be extracted \nand put to good use in the final idea selection. Avoid premature dis-\nmissal of ideas.\nI like to add a third rule:\n• Question everything.

What we assume to be obvious is simply the way things \nhave always been done, but now that it is questioned, we don’t actu-\nally know the reasons. Quite often the solution to problems is discov-\nered through stupid questions, through questioning the obvious.\nPROTOTYPING\nThe only way to really know whether an idea is reasonable is to \ntest it. Build a quick prototype or mock-up of each potential solu-\ntion. In the early stages of this process, the mock-ups can be pen-\ncil sketches, foam and cardboard models, or simple images made \nwith simple drawing tools. I have made mock-ups with spread-\nsheets, PowerPoint slides, and with sketches on index cards or \nsticky notes. Sometimes ideas are best conveyed by skits, espe-\ncially if you’re developing services or automated systems that are \ndifficult to prototype.\nOne popular prototype technique is called “Wizard of Oz,” after \nthe wizard in L. Frank Baum’s classic book (and the classic movie) \nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The wizard was actually just an ordi-\nnary person but, through the use of smoke and mirrors, he man-\naged to appear mysterious and omnipotent. In other words, it was \nall a fake: the wizard had no special powers.\nThe Wizard of Oz method can be used to mimic a huge, powerful \nsystem long before it can be built. It can be remarkably effective in \nthe early stages of product development. I once used this method \nto test a system for making airline reservations that had been de-\nsigned by a research group at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto \nResearch Center (today it is simply the Palo Alto Research Center, \nor PARC). We brought people into my laboratory in San Diego one at \na time, seated them in a small, isolated room, and had them type \ntheir travel requirements into a computer. They thought they were \ninteracting with an automated travel assistance program, but in \nfact, one of my graduate students was sitting in an adjacent room, \nreading the typed queries and typing back responses (looking up \nreal travel schedules where appropriate). This simulation taught \nus a lot about the requirements for such a system. We learned, for \nexample, that people’s sentences were very different from the ones \n",

After the system had determined the desired flight \nto San Francisco, it asked, “When would you like to return?” The \nperson responded, “I would like to leave on the following Tues-\nday, but I have to be back before my first class at 9 am.” We soon \nlearned that it wasn’t sufficient to understand the sentences: we \nalso had to do problem-solving, using considerable knowledge \nabout such things as airport and meeting locations, traffic patterns, \ndelays for getting baggage and rental cars, and of course, parking—\nmore than our system was capable of doing. Our initial goal was to \nunderstand language. The studies demonstrated that the goal was \ntoo limited: we needed to understand human activities.\nPrototyping during the problem specification phase is done mainly \nto ensure that the problem is well understood. If the target popu-\nlation is already using something related to the new product, that \ncan be considered a prototype. During the problem solution phase \nof design, then real prototypes of the proposed solution are invoked.\nTESTING\nGather a small group of people who correspond as closely as pos-\nsible to the target population—those for whom the product is in-\ntended. Have them use the prototypes as nearly as possible to the \nway they would actually use them. If the device is normally used \nby one person, test one person at a time. If it is normally used by a \ngroup, test a group. The only exception is that even if the normal \nusage is by a single person, it is useful to ask a pair of people to use \nit together, one person operating the prototype, the other guiding \nthe actions and interpreting the results (aloud). Using pairs in this \nway causes them to discuss their ideas, hypotheses, and frustra-\ntions openly and naturally. The research team should be observing, \neither by sitting behind those being tested (so as not to distract \nthem) or by watching through video in another room (but having \nthe video camera visible and after describing the procedure).

Opinions vary, but my as-\nsociate, Jakob Nielsen, has long championed the number five: five \npeople studied individually. Then, study the results, refine them, \nand do another iteration, testing five different people. Five is usu-\nally enough to give major findings.

Tests, they be-\nlieve, are only necessary to ensure that the requirements are met. It \nis this philosophy that leads to so many unusable systems.

But what if the product is intended \nfor people all across the world? Many manufacturers make essen-\ntially the same product for everyone. Although automobiles are \nslightly modified for the requirements of a country, they are all \nbasically the same the world round. The same is true for cameras, \ncomputers, telephones, tablets, television sets, and refrigerators. \nYes, there are some regional differences, but remarkably little. Even \nproducts specifically designed for one culture—rice cookers, for \nexample—get adopted by other cultures elsewhere.\nHow can we pretend to accommodate all of these very different, \nvery disparate people? The answer is to focus on activities, not the \nindividual person. I call this activity-centered design. Let the activity \ndefine the product and its structure. Let the conceptual model of \nthe product be built around the conceptual model of the activity.\nWhy does this work? Because people’s activities across the \nworld tend to be similar. Moreover, although people are unwilling \nto learn systems that appear to have arbitrary, incomprehensible \nrequirements, they are quite willing to learn things that appear \nto be essential to the activity. Does this violate the principles of \nhuman-centered design? Not at all: consider it an enhancement of \nHCD. After all, the activities are done by and for people. Activity-\ncentered approaches are human-centered approaches, far better \nsuited for large, nonhomogeneous populations.\nTake another look at the automobile, basically identical all across \nthe world. It requires numerous actions, many of which make lit-\ntle sense outside of the activity and that add to the complexity of \ndriving and to the rather long period it takes to become an accom-\nplished, skilled driver. There is the need to master foot pedals, to \nsteer, use turn signals, control the lights, and watch the road, all \nwhile being aware of events on either side of and behind the vehi-\ncle, and perhaps while maintaining conversations with the other \npeople in the auto.

I \nemphasize the need to design for activities: designing for tasks is \nusually too restrictive. An activity is a high-level structure, perhaps \n“go shopping.” A task is a lower-level component of an activity, \nsuch as “drive to the market,” “find a shopping basket,” “use a \nshopping list to guide the purchases,” and so forth.\nAn activity is a collected set of tasks, but all performed together \ntoward a common high-level goal. A task is an organized, cohesive \nset of operations directed toward a single, low-level goal. Products \nhave to provide support for both activities and the various tasks \nthat are involved. Well-designed devices will package together the \nvarious tasks that are required to support an activity, making them \nwork seamlessly with one another, making sure the work done for \none does not interfere with the requirements for another.\n",

In turn, low-level \nactivities spawn “tasks,” and tasks are eventually executed by ba-\nsic “operations.” The American psychologists Charles Carver and \nMichael Scheier suggest that goals have three fundamental levels \nthat control activities. Be-goals are at the highest, most abstract \nlevel and govern a person’s being: they determine why people act, \nare fundamental and long lasting, and determine one’s self-image. \nOf far more practical concern for everyday activity is the next level \ndown, the do-goal, which is more akin to the goal I discuss in the \nseven stages of activity. Do-goals determine the plans and actions \nto be performed for an activity. The lowest level of this hierar-\nchy is the motor-goal, which specifies just how the actions are per-\nformed: this is more at the level of tasks and operations rather than \nactivities. The German psychologist Marc Hassenzahl has shown \nhow this three-level analysis can be used to guide in the develop-\nment and analysis of a person’s experience (the user experience, \nusually abbreviated UX) in interacting with products. \nFocusing upon tasks is too limiting. Apple’s success with its \nmusic player, the iPod, was because Apple supported the entire \nactivity involved in listening to music: discovering it, purchasing \nit, getting it into the music player, developing playlists (that could \nbe shared), and listening to the music.

Apple made it pos-\nsible to send the music throughout the home, to be listened to on \nthose other companies’ sound systems. Apple’s success was due to \nits combination of two factors: brilliant design plus support for the \nentire activity of music enjoyment.\nDesign for individuals and the results may be wonderful for the \nparticular people they were designed for, but a mismatch for oth-\ners.

This \nis in contrast to the iterative method of human-centered design, \nwhere the process is circular, with continual refinement, contin-\nual change, and encouragement of backtracking, rethinking early \ndecisions. Many software developers experiment with variations \non the theme, variously called by such names as Scrum and Agile.\nLinear, waterfall methods make logical sense. It makes sense that \ndesign research should precede design, design precede engineer-\ning development, engineering precede manufacturing, and so on. \nIteration makes sense in helping to clarify the problem statement \nand requirements; but when projects are large, involving consid-\nerable people, time, and budget, it would be horribly expensive to \nallow iteration to last too long. On the other hand, proponents of \niterative development have seen far too many project teams rush \nto develop requirements that later prove to be faulty, sometimes \nwasting huge amounts of money as a result. Numerous large \nprojects have failed at a cost of multiple billions of dollars.\nThe most traditional waterfall methods are called gated meth-\nods because they have a linear set of phases or stages, with a gate \nblocking transition from one stage to the next. The gate is a man-\nagement review during which progress is evaluated and the deci-\nsion to proceed to the next stage is made.\nWhich method is superior?

Early prototypes have to be tested through real interac-\ntion with the target population in order to refine the requirements.\nThe iterative method, however, is best suited for the early design \nphases of a product, not for the later stages. It also has difficulty \nscaling its procedures to handle large projects. It is extremely dif-\nficult to deploy successfully on projects that involve hundreds or \neven thousands of developers, take years to complete, and cost \nin the millions or billions of dollars. These large projects include \ncomplex consumer goods and large programming jobs, such as au-\ntomobiles; operating systems for computers, tablets, and phones; \nand word processors and spreadsheets.\nDecision gates give management much better control over the \nprocess than they have in the iterative methods. However, they are \ncumbersome. The management reviews at each of the gates can \ntake considerable time, both in preparation for them and then in \nthe decision time after the presentations. Weeks can be wasted be-\ncause of the difficulty of scheduling all the senior executives from \nthe different divisions of the company who wish to have a say. \nMany groups are experimenting with different ways of manag-\ning the product development process. The best methods combine \nthe benefits of both iteration and stage reviews. Iteration occurs \ninside the stages, between the gates. The goal is to have the best of \nboth worlds: iterative experimentation to refine the problem and \nthe solution, coupled with management reviews at the gates.\nThe trick is to delay precise specification of the product require-\nments until some iterative testing with rapidly deployed prototypes \nhas been done, while still keeping tight control over schedule, bud-\nget, and quality. It may appear impossible to prototype some large \nprojects (for example, large transportation systems), but even there a \nlot can be done. The prototypes might be scaled objects, constructed \nby model makers or 3-D printing methods. Even well-rendered \ndrawings and videos of cartoons or simple animation sketches can \nbe useful. Virtual reality computer aids allow people to envision \nthemselves using the final product, and in the case of a building, to \nenvision living or working within it. All of these methods can pro-\nvide rapid feedback before much time or money has been expended.\n",

Large projects are especially \ndifficult, not only because of the problem of managing so many \ndifferent people and groups, but also because the projects’ long \ntime horizon introduces new difficulties. In the many years it takes \nto go from project formulation to completion, the requirements and \ntechnologies will probably change, making some of the proposed \nwork irrelevant and obsolete; the people who will make use of the \nresults might very well change; and the people involved in execut-\ning the project definitely will change.\nSome people will leave the project, perhaps because of illness or \ninjury, retirement or promotion. Some will change companies and \nothers will move on to other jobs in the same company. Whatever \nthe reason, considerable time is lost finding replacements and then \nbringing them up to the full knowledge and skill level required. \nSometimes this is not even possible because critical knowledge \nabout project decisions and methods are in the form we call implicit \nknowledge; that is, within the heads of the workers.

Usually the schedule is driven by outside considerations, in-\ncluding holidays, special product announcement opportunities, \nand even factory schedules. One product I worked on was given \nthe unrealistic timeline of four weeks because the factory in Spain \nwould then go on vacation, and when the workers returned, it \nwould be too late to get the product out in time for the Christmas \nbuying season.\nMoreover, product development takes time even to get started. \nPeople are never sitting around with nothing to do, waiting to be \ncalled for the product. No, they must be recruited, vetted, and then \ntransitioned off their current jobs. This all takes time, time that is \nseldom scheduled.\nSo imagine a design team being told that it is about to work on \na new product. “Wonderful,” cries the team; “we’ll immediately \nsend out our design researchers to study target customers.” “How \n",

Perhaps a week to distill the findings. Four or \nfive weeks.” “Sorry,” says the product manager, “we don’t have \ntime. For that matter, we don’t have the budget to send a team into \nthe field for two weeks.” “But it’s essential if we really want to \nunderstand the customer,” argues the design team. “You’re abso-\nlutely right,” says the product manager, “but we’re behind sched-\nule: we can’t afford either the time or the money. Next time. Next \ntime we will do it right.” Except there is never a next time, because \nwhen the next time comes around, the same arguments get re-\npeated: that product also starts behind schedule and over budget.\nProduct development involves an incredible mix of disciplines, \nfrom designers to engineers and programmers, manufacturing, \npackaging, sales, marketing, and service.

Patents create a minefield for designers \nand engineers, for today it is almost impossible to design or build \nanything that doesn’t conflict with patents, which means redesign \nto work one’s way through the mines.\nEach of the separate disciplines has a different view of the prod-\nuct, each has different but specific requirements to be met. Often \nthe requirements posed by each discipline are contradictory or \nincompatible with those of the other disciplines. But all of them \nare correct when viewed from their respective perspective. In most \ncompanies, however, the disciplines work separately, design pass-\ning its results to engineering and programming, which modify \nthe requirements to fit their needs.

Good product development teams \nwork as harmonious groups, with representatives from all the \nrelevant disciplines present at all times. If all the viewpoints and \nrequirements can be understood by all participants, it is often pos-\nsible to think of creative solutions that satisfy most of the issues. \nNote that working with these teams is also a challenge. Everyone \nspeaks a different technical language. Each discipline thinks it is \nthe most important part of the process. Quite often, each discipline \nthinks the others are stupid, that they are making inane requests. \nIt takes a skilled product manager to create mutual understanding \nand respect. But it can be done.\nThe design practices described by the double-diamond and the \nhuman-centered design process are the ideal. Even though the ideal \ncan seldom be met in practice, it is always good to aim for the ideal, \nbut to be realistic about the time and budgetary challenges. These \ncan be overcome, but only if they are recognized and designed into \nthe process. Multidisciplinary teams allow for enhanced communi-\ncation and collaboration, often saving both time and money.\nThe Design Challenge\nIt is difficult to do good design. That is why it is such a rich, en-\ngaging profession with results that can be powerful and effective. \nDesigners are asked to figure out how to manage complex things, \nto manage the interaction of technology and people. Good design-\ners are quick learners, for today they might be asked to design a \ncamera; tomorrow, to design a transportation system or a compa-\nny’s organizational structure. How can one person work across so \nmany different domains? Because the fundamental principles of \ndesigning for people are the same across all domains. People are \nthe same, and so the design principles are the same.\nDesigners are only one part of the complex chain of processes \nand different professions involved in producing a product.

In dysfunctional companies, each division of the com-\npany is skeptical of the value added to the product by the other \ndivisions.\nIn a properly run organization, team members coming from all \nthe various aspects of the product cycle get together to share their \nrequirements and to work harmoniously to design and produce \na product that satisfies them, or at least that does so with accept-\nable compromises.

The manufacturer has to attend to the \nrequirements of these decision makers, because these are the peo-\nple who actually buy the product. Yes, the needs of the eventual \nusers are important, but to the business, they seem of secondary \nimportance.\nIn some situations, cost dominates.

The selection is almost \nalways based on price plus a list of required features. Usability? \nNot considered. Training costs? Not considered. Maintenance? Not \nconsidered.

If \npeople complained strongly enough, usability could become a re-\nquirement in the purchasing specifications, and that requirement \ncould trickle back to the designers. But without this feedback, de-\nsigners must often design the cheapest possible products because \nthose are what sell. Designers need to understand their customers, \nand in many cases, the customer is the person who purchases the \nproduct, not the person who actually uses it.

That’s why it’s so much \nfun and rewarding when it all comes together to create a success-\nful product.\nDESIGNING FOR SPECIAL PEOPLE\nThere is no such thing as the average person. This poses a particular \nproblem for the designer, who usually must come up with a single \ndesign for everyone. The designer can consult handbooks with ta-\nbles that show average arm reach and seated height, how far the \naverage person can stretch backward while seated, and how much \nroom is needed for average hips, knees, and elbows. Physical anthro-\npometry is what the field is called. With data, the designer can try \nto meet the size requirements for almost everyone, say for the 90th, \n95th, or even the 99th percentile. Suppose the product is designed \nto accommodate the 95th percentile, that is, for everyone except the \n5 percent of people who are smaller or larger. That leaves out a lot \nof people. The United States has approximately 300 million people, \nso 5 percent is 15 million. Even if the design aims at the 99th per-\ncentile it would still leave out 3 million people. And this is just for \nthe United States: the world has 7 billion people. Design for the 99th \npercentile of the world and 70 million people are left out.\nSome problems are not solved by adjustments or averages: Average \na left-hander with a right-hander and what do you get? Sometimes it \nis simply impossible to build one product that accommodates ev-\neryone, so the answer is to build different versions of the product. \nAfter all, we would not be happy with a store that sells only one \nsize and type of clothing: we expect clothing that fits our bodies, \nand people come in a very wide range of sizes. We don’t expect \nthe large variety of goods found in a clothing store to apply to \nall people or activities; we expect a wide variety of cooking appli-\nances, automobiles, and tools so we can select the ones that pre-\ncisely match our requirements.

Actually, many people \ndo not wish to admit having infirmities, even to themselves.\nWhen Sam Farber wanted to develop a set of household tools \nthat his arthritic wife could use, he worked hard to find a solution \nthat was good for everyone. The result was a series of tools that \nrevolutionized this field. For example, vegetable peelers used to be \nan inexpensive, simple metal tool, often of the form shown on the \nleft in Figure 6.3. These were awkward to use, painful to hold, and \nnot even that effective at \npeeling, but everyone as-\nsumed that this was how \nthey had to be.\nAfter considerable re-\nsearch, Farber settled \nupon the peeler shown on \nthe right in Figure 6.3 and \nbuilt a company, OXO, to \nmanufacture and distrib-\nute it.

The \neasiest way to understand the complexity is to try to cook in an \nunfamiliar kitchen. Even excellent cooks have trouble working in \na new environment.\nSomeone else’s kitchen looks complicated and confusing, but \nyour own kitchen does not. The same can probably be said for ev-\nery room in the home. Notice that this feeling of confusion is really \none of knowledge. My kitchen looks confusing to you, but not to \nme. In turn, your kitchen looks confusing to me, but not to you. \nSo the confusion is not in the kitchen: it is in the mind. “Why can’t \nthings be made simple?” goes the cry. Well, one reason is that life \nis complex, as are the tasks we encounter. Our tools must match \nthe tasks.\nI feel so strongly about this that I wrote an entire book on the \ntopic, Living with Complexity, in which I argued that complexity \nis essential: it is confusion that is undesirable. I distinguished be-\ntween “complexity,” which we need to match the activities we take \npart in, and “complicated,” which I defined to mean “confusing.” \nHow do we avoid confusion?

Stan-\ndardization provides a major breakthrough in usability.\nESTABLISHING STANDARDS\nI have enough friends on national and international standards \ncommittees to realize that the process of determining an inter-\nnationally accepted standard is laborious. Even when all parties \nagree on the merits of standardization, the task of selecting stan-\ndards becomes a lengthy, politicized issue.

A set \nof national and international \norganizations works on stan-\ndards; when a new standard is \nproposed, it must work its way \nthrough the organizational hi-\nerarchy. Each step is complex, \nfor if there are three ways of do-\ning something, then there are \nsure to be strong proponents \nof each of the three ways, plus \npeople who will argue that it is \ntoo early to standardize.\nEach proposal is debated at the \nstandards committee meeting where it is presented, then taken back \nto the sponsoring organization—which is sometimes a company, \nsometimes a professional society—where objections and counter-\nobjections are collected. Then the standards committee meets again \nto discuss the objections. And again and again and again. Any com-\npany that is already marketing a product that meets the proposed \nstandard will have a huge economic advantage, and the debates are \ntherefore often affected as much by the economics and politics of \nthe issues as by real technological substance. The process is almost \nguaranteed to take five years, and quite often longer.\nThe resulting standard is usually a compromise among the var-\nious competing positions, oftentimes an inferior compromise. \nSometimes the answer is to agree on several incompatible stan-\ndards. Witness the existence of both metric and English units; of \nleft-hand- and right-hand-drive automobiles.

Yes, they are. Take the ev-\neryday clock. It’s standardized. Consider how much trouble you \nwould have telling time with a backward clock, where the hands \nrevolved “counterclockwise.” A few such clocks exist, primarily as \nhumorous conversation pieces. When a clock truly violates stan-\ndards, such as the one in Figure 6.4 on the previous page, it is dif-\nficult to determine what time is being displayed. Why? The logic \nbehind the time display is identical to that of conventional clocks: \nthere are only two differences—the hands rotate in the opposite \ndirection (counterclockwise) and the location of “12,” usually at \nthe top, has been moved. This clock is just as logical as the stan-\ndard one. It bothers us because we have standardized on a differ-\nent scheme, on the very definition of the term clockwise. Without \nsuch standardization, clock reading would be more difficult: you’d \nalways have to figure out the mapping.\nA STANDARD THAT TOOK SO LONG, \nTECHNOLOGY OVERRAN IT\nI myself participated at the very end of the incredibly long, \ncomplex political process of establishing the US standards for \nhigh-definition television. In the 1970s, the Japanese developed a \nnational television system that had much higher resolution than the \nstandards then in use: they called it “high-definition television.”\nIn 1995, two decades later, the television industry in the United \nStates proposed its own high-definition TV standard (HDTV) to the \nFederal Communications Commission (FCC). But the computer in-\ndustry pointed out that the proposals were not compatible with the \nway that computers displayed images, so the FCC objected to the \nproposed standards. Apple mobilized other members of the indus-\ntry and, as vice president of advanced technology, I was selected \nto be the spokesperson for Apple.

Because of the technical limitations \nin the 1990s, it was suggested that the highest-quality picture have \n1,080 interlaced lines (1080i). We wanted only progressive scan, so \nwe insisted upon 720 lines, progressively displayed (720p), argu-\ning that the progressive nature of the scan made up for the lesser \nnumber of lines.\nThe battle was heated. The FCC told all the competing parties \nto lock themselves into a room and not to come out until they had \nreached agreement. As a result, I spent many hours in lawyers’ \noffices. We ended up with a crazy agreement that recognized mul-\ntiple variations of the standard, with resolutions of 480i and 480p \n(called standard definition), 720p and 1080i (called high-definition), \nand two different aspect ratios for the screens (the ratio of width to \nheight), 4:3 (= 1.3)—the old standard—and 16:9 (= 1.8)—the new \nstandard. In addition, a large number of frame rates were sup-\nported (basically, how many times per second the image was trans-\nmitted). Yes, it was a standard, or more accurately a large number \nof standards. In fact, one of the allowed methods of transmission \nwas to use any method (as long as it carried its own specifications \nalong with the signal). It was a mess, but we did reach agreement. \nAfter the standard was made official in 1996, it took roughly ten \nmore years for HDTV to become accepted, helped, finally, by a \nnew generation of television displays that were large, thin, and in-\nexpensive. The whole process took roughly thirty-five years from \nthe first broadcasts by the Japanese.\nWas it worth the fight? Yes and no. In the thirty-five years that it \ntook to reach the standard, the technology continued to evolve, so \nthe resulting standard was far superior to the first one proposed \nso many years before. Moreover, the HDTV of today is a huge im-\nprovement over what we had before (now called “standard defini-\ntion”). But the minutiae of details that were the focus of the fight \nbetween the computer and TV companies was silly.

So why did we care?\nTelevision displays and compression techniques have improved \nso much that interlacing is no longer needed. Images at 1080p, \nonce thought to be impossible, are now commonplace. Sophisti-\ncated algorithms and high-speed processors make it possible to \ntransform one standard into another; even rectangular pixels are \nno longer a problem.\nAs I write these words, the main problem is the discrepancy in \naspect ratios. Movies come in many different aspect ratios (none \nof them the new standard) so when TV screens show movies, they \neither have to cut off part of the image or leave parts of the screen \nblack. Why was the HDTV aspect ratio set at 16:9 (or 1.8) if no \nmovies used that ratio? Because engineers liked it: square the old \naspect ratio of 4:3 and you get the new one, 16:9.\nToday we are about to embark on yet another standards fight \nover TV.

If there is agreement \non an old-fashioned technology, it may be too expensive for every-\none to change to the new standard. The metric system is a good ex-\nample: it is a far simpler and more usable scheme for representing \ndistance, weight, volume, and temperature than the older English \nsystem of feet, pounds, seconds, and degrees on the Fahrenheit \nscale. But industrial nations with a heavy commitment to the old \nmeasurement standard claim they cannot afford the massive costs \nand confusion of conversion. So we are stuck with two standards, \nat least for a few more decades.\nWould you consider changing how we specify time? The cur-\nrent system is arbitrary. The day is divided into twenty-four rather \narbitrary but standard units—hours. But we tell time in units of \ntwelve, not twenty-four, so there have to be two cycles of twelve \nhours each, plus the special convention of a.m. and p.m. so we \nknow which cycle we are talking about. Then we divide each hour \ninto sixty minutes and each minute into sixty seconds.\nWhat if we switched to metric divisions: seconds divided into \ntenths, milliseconds, and microseconds? We would have days, mil-\nlidays, and microdays. There would have to be a new hour, min-\nute, and second: call them the digital hour, the digital minute, and \nthe digital second. It would be easy: ten digital hours to the day, \none hundred digital minutes to the digital hour, one hundred dig-\nital seconds to the digital minute.\nEach digital hour would last exactly 2.4 times an old hour: 144 \nold minutes. So the old one-hour period of the schoolroom or \ntelevision program would be replaced with a half-digital hour \nperiod, or 50 digital minutes—only 20 percent longer than the \ncurrent hour. We could adapt to the differences in durations with \nrelative ease.\nWhat do I think of it? I much prefer it. After all, the decimal sys-\ntem, the basis of most of the world’s use of numbers and arithme-\ntic, uses base 10 arithmetic and, as a result, arithmetic operations \nare much simpler in the metric system.

The metric system for weights and lengths \ntook hold, but not for time. Decimal time was used long enough for \ndecimal clocks to be manufactured, but it eventually was discarded. \nToo bad. It is very difficult to change well-established habits.

The world still measures time in units of 12 and 60, and \ndivides the circle into 360 degrees.\nIn 1998, Swatch, the Swiss watch company, made its own attempt \nto introduce decimal time through what it called “Swatch Inter-\nnational Time.” Swatch divided the day into 1,000 “.beats,” each \n.beat being slightly less than 90 seconds (each .beat corresponds to \none digital minute). This system did not use time zones, so people \nthe world over would be in synchrony with their watches. This \ndoes not simplify the problem of synchronizing scheduled con-\nversations, however, because it would be difficult to get the sun \nto behave properly.

As a result, even though people would have their watches \nsynchronized, it would still be necessary to know when they woke \nup, ate, went to and from work, and went to sleep, and these times \nwould vary around the world. It isn’t clear whether Swatch was \nserious with its proposal or whether it was one huge advertising \nstunt. After a few years of publicity, during which the company \nmanufactured digital watches that told the time in .beats, it all fiz-\nzled away.\nSpeaking of standardization, Swatch called its basic time unit a \n“.beat” with the first character being a period.

Sure, we have passwords, keys, and other types of \nsecurity checks, but this can become wearisome for the privileged user.

The latches \nwere difficult to find, to reach, and to use. But the difficulties were \ndeliberate. This was good design.

The first edition of this book has had a long and fruit-\nful life. Twenty-five years is an amazingly long time for a book cen-\ntered around technology to have remained relevant. If this revised \nand expanded edition lasts an equally long time, that means fifty \nyears of The Design of Everyday Things. In these next twenty-five \nyears, what new developments will take place? What will be the \nrole of technology in our lives, for the future of books, and what \nare the moral obligations of the design profession? And finally, for \nhow long will the principles in this book remain relevant? It should \nbe no surprise that I believe they will always be just as relevant as \nthey were twenty-five years ago, just as relevant as they are today. \nWhy? The reason is simple. The design of technology to fit human \nneeds and capabilities is determined by the psychology of people. \nYes, technologies may change, but people stay the same.\nCompetitive Forces\nToday, manufacturers around the world compete with one another. \nThe competitive pressures are severe. After all, there are only a \nfew basic ways by which a manufacturer can compete: three of the \nmost important being price, features, and quality—unfortunately \noften in that order of importance. Speed is important, lest some \nother company get ahead in the rush for market presence. These \npressures make it difficult to follow the full, iterative process of \ncontinual product improvement. Even relatively stable home prod-\nucts, such as automobiles, kitchen appliances, television sets, and \ncomputers, face the multiple forces of a competitive market that \nencourage the introduction of changes without sufficient testing \nand refinement.\nHere is a simple, real example. I am working with a new startup \ncompany, developing an innovative line of cooking equipment. \nThe founders had some unique ideas, pushing the technology of \ncooking far ahead of anything available for homes.

Did they steal the ideas? No, it’s what is called the Zeit-\ngeist, a German word meaning “spirit of the time.” In other words, \nthe time was ripe, the ideas were “in the air.” The competition \nemerged even before we had delivered our first product. What is \na small, startup company to do? It doesn’t have money to compete \nwith the large companies. It has to modify its ideas to keep ahead \nof the competition and come up with a demonstration that excites \npotential customers and wows potential investors and, more im-\nportantly, potential distributors of the product. It is the distributors \nwho are the real customers, not the people who eventually buy the \nproduct in stores and use it in their homes. The example illustrates \nthe real business pressures on companies: the need for speed, the \nconcern about costs, the competition that may force the company \nto change its offerings, and the need to satisfy several classes of \ncustomers—investors, distributors, and, of course, the people who \nwill actually use the product.

It over-\ncomes people’s problems and fulfills some important needs. It is \nattractive and easy to use and understand. As a result, suppose the \nproduct is successful: many people buy it and tell their friends to \nbuy it. What could be wrong with this?\nThe problem is that after the product has been available for a \nwhile, a number of factors inevitably appear, pushing the company \ntoward the addition of new features—toward creeping featurism. \nThese factors include:\n•  Existing customers like the product, but express a wish for more fea-\ntures, more functions, more capability.\n•  A competing company adds new features to its products, producing \ncompetitive pressures to match that offering, but to do even more in \norder to get ahead of the competition.\n•  Customers are satisfied, but sales are declining because the market \nis saturated: everyone who wants the product already has it.

But now, as Figure 7.1B \nshows, the same motorcycle has become bloated, with twenty-nine \npieces. I needed instructions.\nCreeping featurism is the tendency to add to the number of fea-\ntures of a product, often extending the number beyond all reason. \nThere is no way that a product can remain usable and understand-\nable by the time it has all of those special-purpose features that \nhave been added in over time.\nIn her book Different, Harvard professor Youngme Moon ar-\ngues that it is this attempt to match the competition that causes all \nproducts to be the same.

In other words, the design of the keyboard.\nConsider the typewriter keyboard, with its arbitrary, diagonally \nsloping arrangement of keys and its even more arbitrary arrange-\nment of their letters. Christopher Latham Sholes designed the cur-\nrent standard keyboard in the 1870s. His typewriter design, with \nits weirdly organized keyboard, eventually became the Remington \ntypewriter, the first successful typewriter: its keyboard layout was \nsoon adopted by everyone.\nThe design of the keyboard has a long and peculiar history. Early \ntypewriters experimented with a wide variety of layouts, using \nthree basic themes. One was circular, with the letters laid out al-\nphabetically; the operator would find the proper spot and depress \na lever, lift a rod, or do whatever other mechanical operation the \ndevice required. Another popular layout was similar to a piano \nkeyboard, with the letters laid out in a long row; some of the early \nkeyboards, including an early version by Sholes, even had black \nand white keys. Both the circular layout and the piano keyboard \nproved awkward. In the end, the typewriter keyboards all ended \nup using multiple rows of keys in a rectangular configuration, with \ndifferent companies using different arrangements of the letters. \nThe levers manipulated by the keys were large and ungainly, and the \nsize, spacing, and arrangement of the keys were dictated by these \nmechanical considerations, not by the characteristics of the human \nhand. Hence the keyboard sloped and the keys were laid out in \na diagonal pattern to provide room for the mechanical linkages. \nEven though we no longer use mechanical linkages, the keyboard \ndesign is unchanged, even for the most modern electronic devices.\nAlphabetical ordering of keys seems logical and sensible: Why \ndid it change? The reason is rooted in the early technology of key-\nboards. Early typewriters had long levers attached to the keys. \nThe levers moved individual typebars to contact the typing paper, \n",

After a few iterations and ex-\nperiments, a standard emerged, one that today governs keyboards \nused throughout the world, although with regional variations. The \ntop row of the American keyboard has the keys Q W E R T Y U I O P, \nwhich gives rise to the name of this layout: QWERTY. The world \nhas adopted the basic layout, although in Europe, for example, one \ncan find QZERTY, AZERTY, and QWERTZ. Different languages \nuse different alphabets, so obviously a number of keyboards had \nto move keys around to make room for additional characters.\nNote that popular legend has it that the keys were placed so as \nto slow down the typing. This is wrong: the goal was to have the \nmechanical typebars approach one another at large angles, thus \nminimizing the chance of collision. In fact, we now know that the \nFIGURE 7.4.

A heavy weight hung from the frame \nadvanced the carriage after each letter was struck, or when the large, rectangular \nplate under the typist’s left hand was depressed (this is the “space bar”).

But don’t despair: it really \nis a good arrangement. One legitimate area of concern is the high \nincidence of a kind of injury that befalls typists: carpal tunnel syn-\ndrome. This ailment is a result of frequent and prolonged repetitive \nmotions of the hand and wrist, so it is common among typists, \nmusicians, and people who do a lot of handwriting, sewing, some \nsports, and assembly line work. Gestural keyboards, such as the \none shown in Figure 7.2D, might reduce the incidence. The US Na-\ntional Institute of Health advises, “Ergonomic aids, such as split \nkeyboards, keyboard trays, typing pads, and wrist braces, may be \nused to improve wrist posture during typing. Take frequent breaks \nwhen typing and always stop if there is tingling or pain.”\nAugust Dvorak, an educational psychologist, painstakingly \ndeveloped a better keyboard in the 1930s. The Dvorak keyboard \nlayout is indeed superior to that of QWERTY, but not to the extent \nclaimed. Studies in my laboratory showed that the typing speed on \na QWERTY was only slightly slower than on a Dvorak, not differ-\nent enough to make upsetting the legacy worthwhile. Millions of \npeople would have to learn a new style of typing. Millions of type-\nwriters would have to be changed. Once a standard is in place, the \nvested interests of existing practices impede change, even where \nthe change would be an improvement. Moreover, in the case of \nQWERTY versus Dvorak, the gain is simply not worth the pain. \n“Good enough” triumphs again.\nWhat about keyboards in alphabetical order? Now that we \nno longer have mechanical constraints on keyboard ordering, \nwouldn’t they at least be easier to learn? Nope. Because the letters \nhave to be laid out in several rows, just knowing the alphabet isn’t \nenough. You also have to know where the rows break, and today, \nevery alphabetic keyboard breaks the rows at different points. One \ngreat advantage of QWERTY—that frequent letter pairs are typed \nwith opposite hands—would no longer be true. In other words, \nforget it. In my studies, QWERTY and Dvorak typing speeds were \nconsiderably faster than those on alphabetic keyboards. And an \n",

Yes, court stenographers can out-type anyone else. They \nuse chord keyboards, typing syllables, not individual letters, di-\nrectly onto the page—each syllable represented by the simultane-\nous pressing of keys, each combination being called a “chord.” The \nmost common keyboard for American law court recorders requires \nbetween two and six keys to be pressed simultaneously to code the \ndigits, punctuation, and phonetic sounds of English.\nAlthough chord keyboards can be very fast—more than three \nhundred words per minute is common—the chords are difficult \nto learn and to retain; all the knowledge has to be in the head. \nWalk up to any regular keyboard and you can use it right away. \nJust search for the letter you want and push that key.

Consider the automobile. Steam-driven vehicles \n(the first automobiles) were developed in the late 1700s.

Amateurs can do a five- \nor ten-minute video, but anything beyond that requires superb \nediting skills. Moreover, there has to be a writer, a cameraperson, \na recording person, and a lighting person. There has to be a direc-\ntor to coordinate these activities and to select the best approach to \neach scene (chapter). A skilled editor is required to piece the seg-\nments together. An electronic book on the environment, Al Gore’s \ninteractive media book Our Choice (2011), lists a large number of \njob titles for the people responsible for this one book: publishers \n(two people), editor, production director, production editor, and \nproduction supervisor, software architect, user interface engineer, \nengineer, interactive graphics, animations, graphics design, photo \neditor, video editors (two), videographer, music, and cover de-\nsigner.

The mix of technologies \nand tools makes quick and rough creation easier, but polished and \nprofessional level material much more difficult. The society of the \nfuture: something to look forward to with pleasure, contemplation, \nand dread.\nThe Moral Obligations of Design\nThat design affects society is hardly news to designers. Many take \nthe implications of their work seriously. But the conscious manip-\nulation of society has severe drawbacks, not the least of which is \nthe fact that not everyone agrees on the appropriate goals. Design, \ntherefore, takes on political significance; indeed, design philoso-\nphies vary in important ways across political systems. In Western \ncultures, design has reflected the capitalistic importance of the mar-\nketplace, with an emphasis on exterior features deemed to be at-\ntractive to the purchaser. In the consumer economy, taste is not the \ncriterion in the marketing of expensive foods or drinks, usability is \nnot the primary criterion in the marketing of home and office appli-\nances. We are surrounded with objects of desire, not objects of use.\nNEEDLESS FEATURES, NEEDLESS MODELS: \nGOOD FOR BUSINESS, BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT\nIn the world of consumable products, such as food and news, there \nis always a need for more food and news. When the product is con-\nsumed, then the customers are consumers. A never-ending cycle. In \nthe world of services, the same applies. Someone has to cook and \nserve the food in a restaurant, take care of us when we are sick, do \nthe daily transactions we all need. Services can be self-sustaining \nbecause the need is always there.\nBut a business that makes and sells durable goods faces a prob-\nlem: As soon as everyone who wants the product has it, then there \nis no need for more. Sales will cease. The company will go out of \nbusiness.\nIn the 1920s, manufacturers deliberately planned ways of making \ntheir products become obsolete (although the practice had existed \n",

A story tells of Henry Ford’s \nbuying scrapped Ford cars and having his engineers disassemble \nthem to see which parts failed and which were still in good shape. \nEngineers assumed this was done to find the weak parts and make \nthem stronger. Nope. Ford explained that he wanted to find the \nparts that were still in good shape. The company could save money \nif they redesigned these parts to fail at the same time as the others.\nMaking things fail is not the only way to sustain sales. The wom-\nen’s clothing industry is an example: what is fashionable this year is \nnot next year, so women are encouraged to replace their wardrobe \nevery season, every year. The same philosophy was soon extended \nto the automobile industry, where dramatic style changes on a reg-\nular basis made it obvious which people were up to date; which \npeople were laggards, driving old-fashioned vehicles. The same is \ntrue for our smart screens, cameras, and TV sets. Even the kitchen \nand laundry, where appliances used to last for decades, have seen \nthe impact of fashion. Now, out-of-date features, out-of-date styling, \nand even out-of-date colors entice homeowners to change. There \nare some gender differences. Men are not as sensitive as women to \nfashion in clothes, but they more than make up for the difference \nby their interest in the latest fashions in automobiles and other \ntechnologies.\nBut why purchase a new computer when the old one is func-\ntioning perfectly well?

A design \nthat people do not purchase is a failed design, no matter how great \nthe design team might consider it.\nDesigners need to make things that satisfy people’s needs, in \nterms of function, in terms of being understandable and usable, \nand in terms of their ability to deliver emotional satisfaction, pride, \nand delight. In other words, the design must be thought of as a \ntotal experience.\n",

If the design complicates the engineering requirements so \nmuch that they cannot be realized within the cost and scheduling \nconstraints, then the design is flawed. Similarly, if manufacturing \ncannot produce the product, then the design is flawed.\nMarketing considerations are important. Designers want to sat-\nisfy people’s needs. Marketing wants to ensure that people ac-\ntually buy and use the product. These are two different sets of \nrequirements: design must satisfy both. It doesn’t matter how \ngreat the design is if people don’t buy it. And it doesn’t matter \nhow many people buy something if they are going to dislike it \nwhen they start using it. Designers will be more effective as they \nlearn more about sales and marketing, and the financial parts of \nthe business.\nFinally, products have a complex life cycle. Many people will \nneed assistance in using a device, either because the design or the \nmanual is not clear, or because they are doing something novel that \nwas not considered in the product development, or for numerous \nother reasons. If the service provided to these people is inadequate, \nthe product will suffer. Similarly if the device must be maintained, \nrepaired, or upgraded, how this is managed affects people’s appre-\nciation of the product.\nIn today’s environmentally sensitive world, the full life cycle of \nthe product must be taken into consideration. What are the envi-\nronmental costs of the materials, of the manufacturing process, of \ndistribution, servicing, and repairs?

Whatever the reason, the Internet addresses I provide may \nno longer work. The good news is that over the years that will \npass after the publication of this book, new and improved search \nmethods will certainly arise. It should be even easier to find more \ninformation about any of the concepts discussed in this book.\nThese notes provide excellent starting points.

The ac-\nademic disciplines of computer science, psychology, human fac-\ntors, and ergonomics all knew of one another’s existence and often \nworked together, but design was not included. Why not design? \nNote that all the disciplines just listed are in the areas of science \nand engineering—in other words, technology. Design was then \nmostly taught in schools of art or architecture as a profession \nrather than as a research-based academic discipline. Designers had \nremarkably little contact with science and engineering. This meant \nthat although many excellent practitioners were trained, there was \nessentially no theory: design was learned through apprenticeship, \nmentorship, and experience.\nFew people in the academic disciplines were aware of the ex-\nistence of design as a serious enterprise, and as a result, design, \nand in particular, graphical, communication, and industrial de-\nsign worked completely independently of the newly emerging \ndiscipline of human-computer interaction and the existing disci-\nplines of human factors and ergonomics. Some product design was \ntaught in departments of mechanical engineering, but again, with \nlittle interaction with design. Design was simply not an academic \ndiscipline, so there was little or no mutual awareness or collabo-\nration. Traces of this distinction remain today, although design is \nmore and more becoming a research-based discipline, where pro-\n",

The boundar-\nies are disappearing.\nThis peculiar history of many independent, disparate groups all \nworking on similar issues makes it difficult to provide references \nthat cover both the academic side of interaction and experience \ndesign, and the applied side of design. The proliferation of books, \ntexts, and journals in human-computer interaction, experience de-\nsign, and usability is huge: too large to cite. In the materials that \nfollow, I provide a very restricted number of examples. When I \noriginally put together a list of works I considered important, it \nwas far too long. It fell prey to the problem described by Barry \nSchwartz in his book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less (2005). \nSo I decided to simplify by providing less. It is easy to find other \nworks, including important ones that will be published after this \nbook. Meanwhile, my apologies to my many friends whose im-\nportant and useful works had to be trimmed from my list.\nIndustrial designer Bill Moggridge was extremely influential in \nestablishing interaction within the design community. He played a \nmajor role in the design of the first portable computer. He was one \nof the three founders of IDEO, one of the world’s most influential \ndesign firms. He wrote two books of interviews with key people \nin the early development of the discipline: Designing Interactions \n(2007) and Designing Media (2010). As is typical of discussions from \nthe discipline of design, his works focus almost entirely upon the \npractice of design, with little attention to the science. Barry Katz, a \ndesign professor at San Francisco’s California College of the Arts, \nStanford’s d.school, and an IDEO Fellow, provides an excellent \nhistory of design practice within the community of companies \nin Silicon Valley, California: Ecosystem of Innovation: The History of \nSilicon Valley Design (2014). An excellent, extremely comprehen-\nsive history of the field of product design is provided by Bern-\nhard Bürdek’s Design: History, Theory, and Practice of Product Design \n(2005). Bürdek’s book, originally published in German but with an \nexcellent English translation, is the most comprehensive history of \nproduct design I have been able to find. I highly recommend it to \nthose who want to understand the historical foundations.\n",

Design-\ners emphasize this aspect of their profession by discussing the spe-\ncial way in which they approach problems, a method they have \ncharacterized as “design thinking.” A good introduction to this \ncomes from the book Change by Design (2009), by Tim Brown and \nBarry Katz. Brown is CEO of IDEO and Katz an IDEO Fellow (see \nthe previous paragraph).\nAn excellent introduction to design research is provided in Jan \nChipchase and Simon Steinhardt’s Hidden in Plain Sight (2013). \nThe book chronicles the life of a design researcher who studies \npeople by observing them in their homes, barber shops, and liv-\ning quarters around the world. Chipchase is executive creative \ndirector of global insights at Frog Design, working out of the \nShanghai office. The work of Hugh Beyer and Karen Holtzblatt \nin Contextual Design: Defining Customer-Centered Systems (1998) \npresents a powerful method of analyzing behavior; they have \nalso produced a useful workbook (Holtzblatt, Wendell, & Wood, \n2004).\nThere are many excellent books.

The work \nexamined the development of computer systems that were easier to \nlearn and easier to use, and in particular, of what has been called \ndirect manipulation computer systems. The initial work is described \nin the chapter “Direct Manipulation Interfaces” in the book from our \nlaboratories, User Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-\nComputer Interaction (Hutchins, Hollan, & Norman, 1986). Also see the \npaper by Hollan, Hutchins, and David Kirsh, “Distributed Cognition: A \nNew Foundation for Human-Computer Interaction Research” (Hollan, \nHutchins, & Kirsh, 2000).\n43  Levitt: “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-\ninch hole!” See Christensen, Cook, & Hal, 2006. The fact that Harvard \nBusiness School marketing professor Theodore Levitt is credited with \nthe quote about the drill and the hole is a good example of Stigler’s law: \n“No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer.” Thus, \nLevitt himself attributed the statement about drills and holes to Leo \nMcGinneva (Levitt, 1983). Stigler’s law is, itself, an example of the law: \nStigler, a professor of statistics, wrote that he learned the law from the \nsociologist Robert Merton. See more at Wikipedia, “Stigler’s Law of \nEponymy” (Wikipedia contributors, 2013c).\n46  Doorknob: The question “In the house you lived in three houses ago, as \nyou entered the front door, was the doorknob on the left or right?” comes \nfrom my paper “Memory, Knowledge, and the Answering of Questions” \n(Norman, 1973).\n53  Visceral, behavioral, and reflective: Daniel Kahneman’s book, Thinking Fast \nand Slow (Kahneman, 2011), gives an excellent introduction to modern \nconceptions of the role of conscious and subconscious processing. The \ndistinctions between visceral, behavioral, and reflective processing \nform the basis of my book Emotional Design (Norman, 2002, 2004). This \nmodel of the human cognitive and emotional system is described in \nmore technical detail in the scientific paper I wrote with Andrew Ortony \nand William Revelle: “The Role of Affect and Proto-affect in Effective \nFunctioning” (Ortony, Norman, & Revelle, 2005). Also see “Designers \nand Users: Two Perspectives on Emotion and Design” (Norman & \nOrtony, 2006). Emotional Design contains numerous examples of the role \nof design at all three levels.\n58  Thermostat: The valve theory of the thermostat is taken from Kempton, \na study published in the journal Cognitive Science (1986). Intelligent \nthermostats try to predict when they will be required, turning on or \noff earlier than the simple control illustrated in Chapter 2 can specify, \nto ensure that the desired temperature is reached at the desired time, \nwithout over- or undershooting the target.\n63  Positive psychology: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s work on flow can be found \nin his several books on the topic (1990, 1997).

An excellent introduction is provided in the article \nby the two of them in the journal American Psychologist (Seligman & \nCsikszentmihalyi, 2000). Since then, positive psychology has expanded \nto include books, journals, and conferences.\n66  Human error: People blame themselves: Unfortunately, blaming the user \nis imbedded in the legal system. When major accidents occur, official \ncourts of inquiry are set up to assess the blame. More and more often, the \nblame is attributed to “human error.” But in my experience, human error \nusually is a result of poor design: why was the system ever designed so \nthat a single act by a single person could cause calamity? An important \nbook on this topic is Charles Perrow’s Normal Accidents (1999). Chapter 5 \nof this book provides a detailed examination of human error.\n72  Feedforward: Feedforward is an old concept from control theory, but I \nfirst encountered it applied to the seven stages of action in the paper \nby Jo Vermeulen, Kris Luyten, Elise van den Hoven, and Karin Coninx \n(2013).\nCHAPTER THREE: KNOWLEDGE IN THE HEAD AND IN THE WORLD\n74 \n American coins: Ray Nickerson and Marilyn Adams, as well as David \nRubin and Theda Kontis, showed that people could neither recall \nnor recognize accurately the pictures and words on American coins \n(Nickerson & Adams, 1979; Rubin & Kontis, 1983).\n80  French coins: The quotation about the French government release of the \n10-franc coin comes from an article by Stanley Meisler (1986), reprinted \nwith permission of the Los Angeles Times.\n80  Descriptions in memory: The suggestion that memory storage and retrieval \nis mediated through partial descriptions was put forth in a paper with \nDanny Bobrow (Norman & Bobrow, 1979). We argued that, in general, \nthe required specificity of a description depends on the set of items \namong which a person is trying to distinguish. Memory retrieval can \ntherefore involve a prolonged series of attempts during which the initial \nretrieval descriptions yield incomplete or erroneous results, so that the \nperson must keep trying, each retrieval attempt coming closer to the \nanswer and helping to make the description more precise.\n83  Constraints of rhyming: Given just the cues for meaning (the first task), \nthe people David C. Rubin and Wanda T. Wallace tested could guess the \nthree target words used in these examples only 0 percent, 4 percent, and \n0 percent of the time, respectively. Similarly, when the same target words \nwere cued only by rhymes, they still did quite poorly, guessing the targets \ncorrectly only 0 percent, 0 percent, and 4 percent of the time, respectively. \nThus, each cue alone offered little assistance. Combining the meaning \ncue with the rhyming cue led to perfect performance: the people got the \ntarget words 100 percent of the time (Rubin & Wallace, 1989).\n",

I discuss the \neffort of retrieval in Learning and Memory (Norman, 1982). Mnemonic \ntechniques are easy to find: just search the web for “mnemonics.” \nSimilarly, the properties of short- and long-term memory are readily \nfound by an Internet search or in any text on experimental psychology, \ncognitive psychology, or neuropsychology (as opposed to clinical \npsychology) or a text on cognitive science. Alternatively, search online \nfor “human memory,” “working memory,” “short-term memory” or \n“long-term memory.” Also see the book by Harvard psychologist Daniel \nSchacter, The Seven Sins of Memory (2001). What are Schacter’s seven sins? \nTransience, absent-mindedness, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility, \npersistence, and bias.\n101  Whitehead: Alfred North Whitehead’s quotation about the power of \nautomated behavior is from Chapter 5 of his book An Introduction to \nMathematics (1911). \n107  Prospective memory: Considerable research on prospective memory and \nmemory for the future is summarized in the articles by Dismukes on \nprospective memory and the review by Cristina Atance and Daniela \nO’Neill on memory for the future, or what they call “episodic future \nthinking” (Atance & O’Neill, 2001; Dismukes, 2012).\n112  Transactive memory: The term transactive memory was coined by Harvard \nprofessor of psychology Daniel Wegner (Lewis & Herndon, 2011; Wegner, \nD.

I recommend Presentation as the most relevant \n(and easiest to read) of his works.\n129  Violating social conventions: “Try violating cultural norms and see how \nuncomfortable that makes you and the other people.” Jan Chipchase and \nSimon Steinhardt’s Hidden in Plain Sight provides many examples of how \ndesign researchers can deliberately violate social conventions so as to \nunderstand how a culture works. Chipchase reports an experiment in \nwhich able-bodied young people request that seated subway passengers \ngive up their seat to them. The experimenters were surprised by two \nthings. First, a large proportion of people obeyed. Second, the people \nmost affected were the experimenters themselves: they had to force \nthemselves to make the requests and then felt bad about it for a long \ntime afterward. A deliberate violation of social constraints can be \nuncomfortable for both the violator and the violated (Chipchase & \nSteinhardt, 2013).\n137  Light switch panel: For the construction of my home light switch panel, \nI relied heavily on the electrical and mechanical ingenuity of Dave \nWargo, who actually did the design, construction, and installation of the \nswitches.\n156  Natural sounds: Bill Gaver, now a prominent design researcher at \nGoldsmiths College, University of London (UK), first alerted me to \nthe importance of natural sounds in his PhD dissertation and later \npublications (Gaver, W., 1997; Gaver, W.

The \nclassification of errors into slips and mistakes was done jointly by me and \nReason. The classification of mistakes into rule-based and knowledge-\nbased follows the work of Rasmussen (Rasmussen, Goodstein, Andersen, \n& Olsen, 1988; Rasmussen, Pejtersen, & Goodstein, 1994; Reason, J. T., \n1990, 1997, 2008).

      "content": "316 Notes to Chapter 5\nUser Centered System Design (Norman & Draper, 1986); two chapters are \nespecially relevant to the discussions here: my “Cognitive Engineering” \nand the one I wrote with Clayton Lewis, “Designing for Error.”\n200  Multitasking: There are many studies of the dangers and inefficiencies of \nmultitasking. A partial review is given by Spink, Cole, & Waller (2008). \nDavid L. Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah have done \nnumerous studies demonstrating rather severe impairment in driving \nbehavior while using cell phones (Strayer & Drews, 2007; Strayer, Drews, \n& Crouch, 2006). Even pedestrians are distracted by cell phone usage, \nas demonstrated by a team of researchers from West Washington \nUniversity (Hyman, Boss, Wise, McKenzie, & Caggiano, 2010).\n200  Unicycling clown: The clever study of the invisible clown, riding a \nunicycle, “Did you see the unicycling clown? Inattentional blindness \nwhile walking and talking on a cell phone” was done by Hyman, Boss, \nWise, McKenzie, & Caggiano (2010).\n208  Swiss cheese model: James Reason introduced his extremely influential \nSwiss cheese model in 1990 (Reason, J., 1990; Reason, J. T., 1997).\n210  Hersman: Deborah Hersman’s description of the design philosophy for \naircraft comes from her talk on February 7, 2013, discussing the NTSB’s \nattempts to understand the cause of the fires in the battery compartments \nof Boeing 787 aircraft. Although the fires caused airplanes to make \nemergency landings, no passengers or crew were injured: the multiple \nlayers of redundant protection maintained safety. Nonetheless, the \nfires and resulting damage were unexpected and serious enough that \nall Boeing 787 airlines were grounded until all parties involved had \ncompleted a thorough investigation of the causes of the incident and \nthen gone through a new certification process with the Federal Aviation \nAgency (for the United States, and through the corresponding agencies in \nother countries). Although this was expensive and greatly inconvenient, it \nis an example of good proactive practice: take measures before accidents \nlead to injury and death (National Transportation Safety Board, 2013).\n212  Resilience engineering: The excerpt from “Prologue: Resilience Engineering \nConcepts,” in the book Resilience Engineering, is reprinted by permission \nof the publishers (Hollnagel, Woods, & Leveson, 2006).\n213  Automation: Much of my research and writings have addressed issues of \nautomation. An early paper, “Coffee Cups in the Cockpit,” addresses this \nproblem as well as the fact that when talking about incidents in a large \ncountry—or that occur worldwide—a “one-in-a-million chance” is not \ngood enough odds (Norman, 1992). My book The Design of Future Things \ndeals extensively with this issue (Norman, 2007).\n214  Royal Majesty accident: An excellent analysis of the mode error accident \nwith the cruise ship Royal Majesty is contained in Asaf Degani’s book on \nautomation, Taming HAL: Designing Interfaces Beyond 2001 (Degani, 2004), as \nwell as in the analyses by Lützhöft and Dekker and the official NTSB report \n(Lützhöft & Dekker, 2002; National Transportation Safety Board, 1997). \n",

      "content": " \nNotes to Chapter 6 317\nCHAPTER SIX: DESIGN THINKING\nAs pointed out in the “General Readings” section, a good intro-\nduction to design thinking is Change by Design by Tim Brown and \nBarry Katz (2009). Brown is CEO of IDEO and Katz a professor at \nthe California College of the Arts, visiting professor at Stanford’s \nd.school, and an IDEO Fellow. There are multiple Internet sources; \nI like designthinkingforeducators.com.\n220  Double diverge-converge pattern: The double diverge-converge pattern was \nfirst introduced by the British Design Council in 2005, which called it the \n“Double-Diamond Design Process Model” (Design Council, 2005).\n221  HCD process: The human-centered design process has many variants, \neach similar in spirit but different in the details. A nice summary of the \nmethod I describe is provided by the HCD book and toolkit from the \ndesign firm IDEO (IDEO, 2013).\n227  Prototyping: For prototyping, see Buxton’s book and handbook on \nsketching (Buxton, 2007; Greenberg, Carpendale, Marquardt, & Buxton, \n2012). There are multiple methods used by designers to understand the \nnature of the problem and come to a potential solution. Vijay Kumar’s \n101 Design Methods (2013) doesn’t even cover them all. Kumar’s book is \nan excellent treatment of design research methods, but its focus is on \ninnovation, not the production of products, so it does not cover the actual \ndevelopment cycle. Physical prototyping, their tests, and iterations are \noutside the domain, as are the practical concerns of the marketplace, the \ntopic of the last part of this chapter and all of chapter 7.\n227  Wizard of Oz technique: The Wizard of Oz technique is named after \nL. Frank Baum’s book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Baum & Denslow, \n1900). My use of the technique is described in the resulting paper from \nthe group headed by artificial intelligence researcher Danny Bobrow at \nwhat was then called the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Bobrow \net al., 1977). The “graduate student” sitting in the other room was Allen \nMunro, who then went on to a distinguished research career.\n229  Nielsen: Jakob Nielsen’s argument that five users is the ideal number for \nmost tests can be found on the Nielsen Norman group’s website (Nielsen, \n2013).\n233  Three goals: Marc Hassenzahl’s use of the three levels of goals (be-goals, \ndo-goals, and motor-goals) is described in many places, but I strongly \nrecommend his book Experience Design (Hassenzahl, 2010). The three \ngoals come from the work of Charles Carver and Michael Scheier in their \nlandmark book on the use of feedback models, chaos, and dynamical \ntheory to explain much of human behavior (Carver & Scheier, 1998).\n246  Age and performance: A good review of the impact of age on human factors \nis provided by Frank Schieber (2003).

I’ve managed to \ntrace the origin of this term to a talk by John Mashey in 1976 (Mashey, \n1976). At that time Mashey was a computer scientist at Bell Laboratories, \nwhere he was one of the early developers of UNIX, a well-known \ncomputer operating system (which is still active as Unix, Linux, and the \nkernel underlying Apple’s Mac OS).\n262  Youngme Moon: Youngme Moon’s book Different: Escaping the Competitive \nHerd (Moon, 2010) argues that “If there is one strain of conventional \nwisdom pervading every company in every industry, it is the importance \nof competing hard to differentiate yourself from the competition. And \nyet going head-to-head with the competition—with respect to features, \nproduct augmentations, and so on—has the perverse effect of making \nyou just like everyone else.” (From the jacket of her book: see http://\nyoungmemoon.com/Jacket.html.)\n266  Word-gesture system: The word-gesture system that works by tracing the \nletters on the screen keyboard to type rapidly and efficiently (although \nnot as fast as with a traditional ten-finger keyboard) is described in \nconsiderable detail by Shumin Zhai and Per Ola Kristensson, two of the \ndevelopers of this method of typing (Zhai & Kristensson, 2012).\n269  Multitouch screens: In the more than thirty years multitouch screens have \nbeen in the laboratories, numerous companies have launched products \nand failed. Nimish Mehta is credited with the invention of multitouch, \ndiscussed in his master’s thesis (1982) from the University of Toronto. \nBill Buxton (2012), one of the pioneers in this field, provides a valuable \nreview (he was working with multitouch displays in the early 1980s at \nthe University of Toronto). Another excellent review of multitouch and \ngestural systems in general (as well as design principles) is provided \nby Dan Saffer in his book Designing Gestural Interfaces (2009). The story \nof Fingerworks and Apple is readily found by searching the web for \n“Fingerworks.”\n270 Stigler’s law: See the comment about this in the notes for Chapter 2.\n271  Telephonoscope: The illustration of the “Telephonoscope” was originally \npublished in the December 9, 1878, issue of the British magazine Punch \n(for its 1879 Almanack). The picture comes from Wikipedia (Wikipedia \ncontributors, 2013d), where it is in the public domain because of its age.\n276  QWERTY keyboard: The history of the QWERTY keyboard is discussed \nin numerous articles. I thank Professor Neil Kay of University of \nStrathclyde for our e-mail correspondence and his article “Rerun the \n",

      "content": " \nNotes to Chapter 7 319\nTape of History and QWERTY Always Wins” (2013). This article led me \nto the “QWERTY People Archive” website by the Japanese researchers \nKoichi and Motoko Yasuoka, an incredibly detailed, valuable resource \nfor those interested in the history of the keyboard, and in particular, \nof the QWERTY configuration (Yasuoka & Yasuoka, 2013). The article \non the typewriter in the 1872 Scientific American is fun to read: the style \nof Scientific American has changed drastically since then (Anonymous, \n1872).\n278  Dvorak keyboard: Is Dvorak faster than QWERTY? Yes, but not by much: \nDiane Fisher and I studied a variety of keyboard layouts. We thought that \nalphabetically organized keys would be superior for beginners. No, they \nweren’t: we discovered that knowledge of the alphabet was not useful \nin finding the keys. Our studies of alphabetical and Dvorak keyboards \nwere published in the journal Human Factors (Norman & Fisher, 1984).\nAdmirers of the Dvorak keyboard claim much more than a 10 percent \nimprovement, as well as faster learning rates and less fatigue. But I \nwill stick by my studies and my statements. If you want to read more, \nincluding a worthwhile treatment of the history of the typewriter, see \nthe book Cognitive Aspects of Skilled Typewriting, edited by William E. \nCooper, which includes several chapters of research from my laboratory \n(Cooper, W. E., 1963; Norman & Fisher, 1984; Norman & Rumelhart, 1963; \nRumelhart & Norman, 1982).\n278  Keyboard ergonomics: Health aspects of keyboards are reported in \nNational Institute of Health (2013).\n279  Incremental and radical innovation: The Italian business professor Roberto \nVerganti and I discuss the principles of incremental and radical \ninnovation (Norman & Verganti, 2014; Verganti, 2009, 2010).\n281  Hill climbing: There are very good descriptions of the hill-climbing \nprocess for design in Christopher Alexander’s book Notes on the Synthesis \nof Form (1964) and Chris Jones’s book Design Methods (1992; also see Jones, \n1984).\n286  Humans versus machines: The remarks by MIT professor Erik Brynjolfsson \nwere made in his talk at the June 2012 National Academy of Engineering \nsymposium on manufacturing, design, and innovation (Brynjolfsson, \n2012). His book, coauthored with Andrew McAfee—Race Against the \nMachine: How the Digital Revolution Is Accelerating Innovation, Driving \nProductivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy—\ncontains an excellent treatment of design and innovation (Brynjolfsson \n& McAfee, 2011).\n290  Interactive media: Al Gore’s interactive media book is Our Choice (2011). \nSome of the videos from my early interactive book are still available: see \nNorman (1994 and 2011b).\n295  Rise of the small: The section “The Rise of the Small” is taken from my \nessay written for the hundredth anniversary of the Steelcase company, \nreprinted here with Steelcase’s permission (Norman, 2011a).\n",
