This new edition is a completely revised, updated and extended version of a classic text.\n\nFocusing on what designers actually do when they are designing, the book is structured around a series of in-depth case studies of the work of outstanding and expert designers, interwoven and developed with commentary and comparison. The coverage reflects the breadth of design from architecture to engineering, from consumer products to communications and from individual designing to teamwork and collaborative designing. The scale of designing ranges from Formula One racing cars to city commuting cars, locomotives to bicycles, sewing machines to litter bins and lemon squeezers. The book is based on evidence from observation and investigation of design practice, providing insights into and understanding of design thinking, and the development of design ability from novice to expert.\n\nDesign Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work offers an overview from one of design’s most experienced and influential scholars. This book goes to the heart of what it means to think and work as a designer. It is an ideal guide for anyone who wants to become a designer or to know how good designers work in the field of contemporary design.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nMy friends Gordon Murray and Kenneth Grange freely and\n\nreadily gave the time and patience to discuss their work at length, reported in Chapters 2 and 3. Victor Scheinman generously volunteered to participate in the experiment reported in Chapter 5, as did the anonymous designers from IDEO, ‘Ivan’, ‘John’ and ‘Kerry’, reported in Chapter 6, all providing their time and talent free of charge and allowing their design activity to be observed, recorded and analysed. My colleagues at the Delft University of Technology, Kees Dorst and Henri Christiaans, provided the initiative and the hard work in the design and conduct of the experiments. The facilities for the experiments were provided by the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, with the considerable help of Steve Harrison and Scott Minneman. My wife, Anita Clayburn Cross, also contributed considerably to analysing the experiments and to discussions with Gordon and Kenneth, as well as to my general well-being throughout.\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere are two rather different interpretations of ‘design thinking’.\n\nBoth are based on the practices of designers, but one (the original formulation of ‘design thinking’) is focused firmly within design practice whereas the other (a more recent but perhaps transient formulation) is focused outside the normal design domain, notably in business and the management of innovation. The latter formulation has been attractive within businesses that have realized the financial and competitive benefits of design-led technology. It has also been applied in a diversity of other fields, such as in education and more broadly in social innovation. This wider recognition of the relevance and value of design thinking is welcome. However, whilst the wider formulation draws upon some aspects of design practice, such as creative thinking, it is often applied through a simplified version of design methods adapted by and for consultants who mainly do not work within the design domain. These two different formulations and applications have led to some confusion because they both use the term ‘design thinking’. This book follows the original formulation of design thinking, which grew from the study of design processes, design reasoning and design cognition.\n\nEvery experienced designer has learned, practised and honed their designerly ways of knowing, acting and thinking. Designers know about the technical aspects of their professions, about the materials and manufacturing processes of their field, about the habits and preferences of the users of their products and systems, about organizing and managing projects and teams, and about precedents and exemplars within their field. Designers act in ways that are creative but constrained by the problem requirements set by their clients, guided by the goals and abilities of the potential users of their products and systems, and facilitated and enhanced by their own\n\n2\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\npowers and processes of imagining, modelling and evaluating ideas for partial or interim solutions. Designers think strategically within and around the problems they are given and the solutions they are creating, developing together both the problem and the possibilities for its solution to reach a satisfactory, matching resolution of both, using patterns and types of constructive reasoning. These designerly ways of knowing, acting and thinking are not something that can be gained adequately just from a seminar, a one-day workshop or even a four-day ‘bootcamp’ in design thinking – or just reading a book.\n\nThis book is about design thinking in terms of the practical, strategical and cognitive skills actually used by designers in creating proposals for new products and systems. This is not a methods or ‘how-to’ book but a book that provides explanation, commentary and advice, rather than instruction (although becoming more self-aware of one’s thinking and acting can help in the development of skills and abilities). It is a book that reveals what has been learned from research into many different aspects of designerly thinking and is intended to sit within that culture of research and education. Its primary purpose is expressed in its subtitle: understanding how designers think and work.\n\nIn writing this book, my goal has been to help anyone interested in design to develop their understanding of how designers think and work. Anyone so interested might well be a design student, teacher or researcher, perhaps a practising designer who still finds their own processes mysterious or difficult, other professionals who want to develop their understanding of design thinking or indeed anyone interested in the mysteries of designing, because anyone can be a designer, even in everyday activities. The focus of the book is on revealing what designers do during the activity of designing and on building an appreciation of the nature of design ability and expertise. Readers should gain from the book some insight into what it means to be a designer, how designers employ their practical, strategical and cognitive skills, both individually and collaboratively, and what is known about the nature of design ability and its development from novice student to expert professional.\n\nMy own background includes architectural and industrial design, but primarily I am a design educator and researcher with an interest in the common aspects of designing that recur across different\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nprofessional fields of practice. My approach to trying to understand how designers think and work is research-based: I look for and report evidence that comes from observation, experiment, analysis and reflection. My aim is to reveal and articulate the apparently mysterious (and sometimes mystified) cognitive and creative abilities of designers, that are common across many design fields.\n\nI take an interdisciplinary approach to design, so throughout the book observations are made, and comparisons are drawn, across various professional fields such as architectural, product, engineering and automotive design. Other professional design fields, such as software and interaction design, furniture design and communication design, are also mentioned. But because I take a research-based approach to understanding design thinking, some fields get less coverage in the book simply because less research has been conducted in them (or I am less aware of it). Nevertheless, I believe that many aspects of design thinking are common across the different fields of application, and so I trust that my observations and comments will have some validity across them all.\n\nThe design of this book\n\nJust about everything that we have around us has been designed. Anything that isn’t a genuine, untouched-by-human-hands piece of nature has been designed by someone, including this book. Many people have been involved in the design of the book, including editors, typesetters and graphic designers, and the external reviewers. I am responsible for the choice of the words and illustrations, the selection and presentation of the evidence and the construction of the arguments, but I have also designed the overall structure of the book in a way that I hope helps the reader to use it and navigate through it.\n\nThe structure is based upon a repeated pattern of double case studies followed by a commentary that summarizes and discusses what can be learned from the case studies in more general terms, and brings in and builds relationships with a wider field of literature in studies of design thinking. The focus of the first pair of case studies and the following discussion is more on ‘how designers think’ and\n\n3\n\n4\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nthe focus of the second pair is more on ‘how designers work’. These case studies are based on my own research; each of them is treated in depth and forms a complete chapter. They provide a focused resource for the study of high-quality, expert design thinking. The commentary and overview chapters that follow them provide discussion and reflection that I hope lead the reader into a broader and deeper understanding of the nature of design thinking. These central elements of case studies plus discussion are bounded by chapters at the beginning and the end of the book on design ability and design expertise.\n\nThe first two case studies (Chapters 2 and 3) are interview- based and draw upon the work of highly successful, outstanding contemporary designers: one an automotive designer, Gordon Murray, and the other an industrial designer, Kenneth Grange. The other two case studies (Chapters 5 and 6) are experiment-based research studies, featuring an expert engineering designer, Victor Scheinman, and a team of experienced product designers from the IDEO design consultancy. Both Victor and the IDEO team were asked to tackle the same small design project in a recorded, laboratory-like situation. In addition to observations to be made, and lessons to be drawn from these four particular case studies, I draw widely upon the research literature in design thinking in order to amplify and extend from the particular to the general in the four other chapters. Each of those chapters concludes with a short summary of its main points and the sources from which they are drawn. Occasional words or phrases that might perhaps be novel for readers, or have particular meanings or connotations within research in design thinking, are highlighted in bold type and are defined or expanded upon in a Glossary included at the end of the book.\n\nThe structure of this book.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5",

To design things is normal for human beings and something not always regarded as needing special abilities. Design ability has often been a collective or shared ability, and it is only in fairly recent history that the ability to design has become regarded as a kind of special competence.\n\nAlthough there is so much design activity going on in the world, the ways in which people design were rather poorly understood for rather a long time. Design ability has been regarded as something that perhaps many people possess to some degree, but only a few people have a particularly strong design talent or ‘gift’. Of course, we do know that some people are better designers than others. Ever since the emergence of designers as professional specialists, it has appeared that some people have a design ability that is more highly developed than other people – either through some genetic endowment or through social and educational development.\n\n8\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nHowever, there are now growing bodies of knowledge about the nature of designing, and about the core features of design ability, such that we can be more articulate about this apparently mysterious human competence.\n\nStudying design ability\n\nThrough research and study there has been a slow but steady growth in our understanding of design ability. The studies have ranged from student designers to experienced, expert and outstanding designers. The kinds of methods used in these studies have included interviews (asking designers about what they do), analytical case studies (deconstructing what designers do), real-world and laboratory-style studies (watching what designers do), and reflection and theorizing (thinking about what designers do). All of these methods have helped to develop an understanding of how designers think and work.\n\nA variety of research methods has been required because to understand design ability it is necessary to approach it slightly obliquely. Like all kinds of sophisticated cognitive abilities, it is impossible to approach it directly, or bluntly. Designers themselves are often not very good at explaining how they design. When designers – especially skilled, successful designers – talk spontaneously about what they do, they talk almost exclusively about the outcomes, not the activities. They talk about the products of their designing rather than the process. This is a common feature of experts in any field. Their enthusiasm lies in evaluating what they produce, rather than in analysing how they produce it.\n\nSometimes, some designers can even seem to be wilfully obscure about how they work and where their ideas come from. The renowned French designer Philippe Starck is known to suggest that design ideas seem to come to him quite quickly and spontaneously, as if from nowhere. For example, of the design of his iconic lemon squeezer for the Italian kitchenware manufacturer Alessi, Starck has said that, in a restaurant, ‘this vision of a squid-like lemon squeezer came upon me’. And so, just like that, Juicy Salif, the lemon squeezer (Figure 1.1), was conceived, went into production and on to become a\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\nFIGURE 1.1 Philippe Starck’s Juicy Salif lemon squeezer for Alessi. Courtesy of Philippe Starck. Photograph by Nigel Cross.\n\nphenomenally successful product in terms of sales (if not necessarily in terms of its apparent function).\n\nDesigners can also seem to be quite arrogant in the claims that they make. Perhaps it seems arrogant for the architect Denys Lasdun to have claimed that ‘Our job is to give the client . . . not what he wants, but what he never dreamed he wanted’. But I think that we should try to see through the apparent arrogance in this statement, to the underlying truth that their clients do want designers to transcend the obvious and the mundane, and to produce proposals that are exciting and attractive as well as practical. What this means is that designing is not a search for the optimum solution to the given problem, but that it is a creative, exploratory process. The creative designer interprets the design brief not as a specification for a solution but as a starting point for a journey of exploration; the designer sets off to explore, to discover something new, rather than to reach somewhere already known or to return with yet another example of the already familiar.\n\n9\n\n10\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nI do not want to imply here that designing is indeed a mysterious process, but I do want to suggest that it is complex. Expert designers exercise very developed forms of certain tacit, deep-seated cognitive skills. But, as we shall see later, it is possible to unravel even Philippe Starck’s visionary Juicy Salif moment into a much less mysterious explanation of his design process.\n\nAsking designers about what they do\n\nThe spontaneous comments of designers themselves about designing can seem obscure, but it is possible to gain some insights by interviewing them more carefully and interpreting the implications of their responses. Asking designers about what they do is perhaps the simplest and most direct form of inquiry into design ability, although this technique has not in fact been practised extensively.\n\nRobert Davies interviewed members of the UK-based ‘Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry’. This is an elite body of designers, affiliated to the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce or the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) as it is more conveniently known. Royal Designers for Industry (RDIs) are selected for the honour of appointment to the Faculty on the basis of their outstanding achievements in design. So choosing RDIs for interview is one way of ensuring that you are interviewing eminent designers with a record of achievement and accomplishment; that they do indeed possess and use a high level of design ability. At the time Davies conducted his interviews there were sixty-eight RDIs, ranging over professions such as graphic design, product design, furniture design, textile design, fashion design, engineering design, automotive design and interior design. He interviewed thirty-five of these, conducting the interviews informally at their own homes or places of work but recording the discussions.\n\nDavies was especially interested in the creative aspects of design ability. His informal interviews tended to range widely over many aspects of the design process, and on what seems to make some people ‘creative’. One theme that recurred in their responses was the designers’ reliance on what they regarded as ‘intuition’. For example, the architect and industrial designer Jack Howe said, ‘I\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\nbelieve in intuition. I think that’s the difference between a designer and an engineer . . . I make a distinction between engineers and engineering designers . . . An engineering designer is just as creative as any other sort of designer.’ The product designer Richard Stevens made a rather similar comment about the difference between engineering and designing: ‘A lot of engineering design is intuitive, based on subjective thinking. But an engineer is unhappy doing this. An engineer wants to test; test and measure. He’s been brought up this way and he’s unhappy if he can’t prove something. Whereas an industrial designer is entirely happy making judgements which are intuitive.’\n\nWhat these designers are saying is that they find some aspects of their work appear to them to be natural, perhaps almost unconscious, ways of thinking, and they find that some other types of people (notably, the engineers with whom they come into contact in the course of their work) are uncomfortable with this way of thinking. They believe that this ‘intuitive’ way of thinking may be something that they inherently possess, or it may be something that they developed through their education. It may also be that they are overlooking the considerable experience that they have gathered, and in fact their ‘intuitive’ responses may be derived from these large pools of experience, and from prior learning gained from making appropriate, and inappropriate, responses in certain situations.\n\nHowever, ‘intuitive’ thinking might be right in a more profound sense, meaning that it is not based upon conventional forms of logical reasoning. The concept of ‘intuition’ may be a convenient, shorthand word for what really happens in design thinking. The more useful concept that has been used by design researchers in explaining the reasoning processes of designers is that design thinking is abductive: a type of reasoning different from the more familiar concepts of inductive and deductive reasoning, but which is the necessary reasoning or logic of design. It is this particular logic of design that provides the means to shift and transfer thought between the required purpose of some activity and appropriate forms for an object to satisfy that purpose. We will explore this logic of design later.\n\nAnother theme that arose from Davies’s interviews with these leading designers is related to this tricky relationship between the\n\n11\n\n12\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\n‘problem’ (what is required) and its ‘solution’ (how to satisfy that requirement). Designers recognize that problems and solutions in design are closely interwoven, that ‘the solution’ is not always a straightforward answer to ‘the problem’. A solution may be something that not only the client but also the designer ‘never dreamed he wanted’. For example, commenting on one of his more creative designs, the furniture designer Geoffrey Harcourt said, ‘As a matter of fact, the solution that I came up with wasn’t a solution to the problem at all. I never saw it as that . . . But when the chair was actually put together, in a way it quite well solved the problem, but from a completely different angle, a completely different point of view.’ This ‘point of view’ comment suggests something of the perceptual aspect of design thinking – like seeing the vase rather than the faces, in the well-known ambiguous figure (Figure 1.2a). It implies that designing utilizes aspects of emergence; relevant features emerge in tentative solution concepts and can be recognized as having properties that suggest how the developing solution concept might be matched to the also developing problem concept. Emergent properties are those that are perceived or recognized in a partial or proto-solution that were not consciously included or intended. In a sketch, for example, an emergent aspect is something that was not drawn as itself but which can be seen in the overlaps or relationships between the drawn components (Figure 1.2b). In the process of designing, the problem and the solution develop together.\n\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Ambiguity – vase or faces? (b) emergence – two overlapping triangles also contain emergent features such as a hexagon and a six-pointed star.\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\nGiven the complex nature of design activity, therefore, it hardly seems surprising that the structural engineering designer Ted Happold suggested to Davies that ‘I really have, perhaps, one real talent, which is that I don’t mind at all living in the area of total uncertainty.’ Happold certainly needed this talent, as a leading member of the structural design team for some of the most challenging buildings in the world, such as the Sydney Opera House and the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and in his own engineering design work in lightweight structures. The uncertainty of design is both the frustration and the joy that designers get from their activity; they have learned to live with the fact that design proposals may remain ambiguous and uncertain until quite late in the process. Designers will generate early tentative solutions, but also leave many options open for as long as possible; they are prepared to regard solution concepts as temporarily imprecise and often inconclusive.\n\nAnother common theme from Davies’s interviews is that designers need to use sketches, drawings and models of all kinds as a way of exploring problem and solution together, and of making some progress when faced with the complexity of design. For example, Jack Howe said that, when uncertain how to proceed, ‘I draw something. Even if it’s “potty” I draw it. The act of drawing seems to clarify my thoughts.’ He is saying that, when faced with a blank sheet of paper, he can at least draw something that may at first seem silly or inappropriate, but which provides a starting point to which he can respond; if it doesn’t seem right, why doesn’t it? Designing, it seems, is difficult to conduct by purely internal mental processes; the designer needs to interact with external representations. The activity of sketching, drawing or modelling provides some of the circumstances by which designers put themselves into the design situation and engage with the exploration of both the problem and its solution. There is a cognitive limit to the amount of complexity that can be handled internally; sketching provides a temporary, external store for tentative ideas and supports the ‘dialogue’ that the designer has between problem and solution.\n\nMany aspects of design ability that emerge from Davies’s study are also reflected in another set of interviews with highly successful designers, conducted by Bryan Lawson, who interviewed a number of internationally leading architects.

For example, the British architect Richard MacCormac said, ‘Whenever we have a design session or a crit review session in the office I cannot say anything until I’ve got a pencil in my hand . . . I feel the pencil to be my spokesman, as it were . . . I haven’t got an imagination that can tell me what I’ve got without drawing it . . . I use drawing as a process of criticism and discovery.’ Here, MacCormac is saying that he uses drawing both as a means of imaging, imagining or discovering something that he cannot construct just in his mind and as a means of communicating with others – the pencil is his ‘spokesman’, communicating by means of what he draws. Note that the ‘spokesman’ is not only communicator but also critic and discoverer, which reinforces just how cognitively important the act of sketching is to the designer.\n\nDesigners learn to think through this sketch-like form, in which the abstract patterns of client and user requirements are turned into the concrete patterns of an actual object. It is like learning another form of language, a kind of code which transforms ‘thoughts’ into ‘words’. Design thinking is practised and embodied in this language and its codes. Obtaining and using this graphic ‘language’ has been termed graphicacy, equivalent to obtaining and using numeracy and literacy.\n\nAlso as in the study by Davies, Lawson identified from his interviews something of the complex relationship in design between problem and solution. Richard MacCormac spoke of defining the problem through attempting solutions: ‘Issues which are the stuff of the thing often only come out when you try and produce a scheme, and therefore the design process defines objectives in a way in which the brief could never do.’ In fact, when I interviewed Richard MacCormac, he told me: ‘I don’t think you can design anything just by absorbing information and then hoping to synthesise it into a solution. What you need to know about the problem only becomes apparent as you’re trying to solve it.’ This confirms a view that the design brief is not a specification for a solution but the starting point for an exploration. Like Denys Lasdun saying that the architect’s job is to give the client something other than ‘what he wants’, Richard MacCormac told Lawson, ‘Often in competitions the winning scheme is the one that tells the client something that they never knew before . . . something that is terribly important to them and was not in\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\nthe brief’. This is the reason why unsuccessful design competition entrants sometimes complain that the winner ‘didn’t stick to the brief’. As Lawson commented, ‘Although we tend to admire designers for their solutions, it is often their ability to find the right problems which distinguishes good from adequate or poor design.’\n\nLawson also suggested that good designers are good at coping with uncertainty. Several of his interviewed architects spoke of carrying on ‘parallel processes’ of cognition relevant to the same design job at the same time. Lawson found a strong example of what he called such ‘parallel lines of thought’ in the American architect Robert Venturi’s description of working on his design for the Sainsbury Wing extension to the National Gallery in London. One particular line of thought concerned ideas for relating the circulation system in the new building to that in the older part (issues of the plan and of floor levels), whilst another was for relating together the external appearances of the new and old parts (issues of the façade and of architectural styles). Lawson suggests that Venturi kept these two sets of ideas in progress, both equally important to his design thinking, before resolving them into a single solution. ‘The problem for the designer’, Lawson commented, ‘is when the attempt should be made to reconcile all the ideas, or lines of thought, which are developing . . . what seems clear is that a degree of bravery is required to allow these lines of thought to remain parallel rather longer than might seem reasonable to the inexperienced designer.’ Coping with uncertainty, as Ted Happold emphasized, seems to be a key factor in design ability.\n\nOne way to cope with uncertainty is to try to impose order. Jane Darke also interviewed a number of successful architects and noticed how they sought to impose order on the problems they faced. Some brought to the problem a personal set of guiding principles that offered starting points, some sought to find starting points in the particularities of the site on which they were to build. Darke observed how these starting points enabled the designers to make the problem more manageable, to provide a narrower focus within which they could work. The designers imposed a limited set of objectives, or an idea about the building form, as a ‘primary generator’, as Darke called it, a means of instantiating a solution concept. This seems to be a necessary part of the design process, because a solution concept\n\n15\n\n16\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\ncannot be derived directly from the problem statement; the designer has to add something to it.\n\nDeconstructing what designers do\n\nWhat designers say about what they do can of course be rather biased, or based on partial recall, or limited by their willingness or ability to articulate what are, after all, complex cognitive activities. However, what designers actually do in the process of designing can to some extent be observed in the traces that they leave – their sketches, drawings and notes. So trying to understand what has gone on in that process of sketching and thinking could give us some insights into the core nature of designing. In examining and deconstructing their series of tentative drawn outputs we see, for instance, how sketching helps the designer to consider many aspects at once – we see plans, elevations, details, views, all being drawn together and thus all being thought about, reasoned about, all together. Comments and calculations are also often made alongside representations of the emerging design, as the designer generates alternative versions, considers and criticizes them and continues the voyage of exploration.\n\nI suggested before that it is possible to unravel even Philippe Starck’s mystical account of the conception of his Juicy Salif lemon squeezer into a much less mysterious explanation. To do this, I am drawing upon an exercise in deconstructing this particular design act by Peter Lloyd and Dirk Snelders, in which they utilized the evidence of Starck’s very first design sketches for it, what (little) he has said about the conception of the lemon squeezer and what he has said about himself and his interests in various interviews.\n\nThe Alessi company had started a new series of products designed by internationally famous designers, including kettles and coffee pots by architects Michael Graves and Aldo Rossi, and cutlery and condiment sets by industrial designers Richard Sapper and Ettore Sottsass, when they invited Philippe Starck to offer a new product in this ‘designer’ series, a lemon squeezer. Philippe went to Italy to visit Alessi and discuss the project. He then took a short break on the small island of Capraia, just off the Tuscan coast, and went to dine in\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\na restaurant, Il Corsaro. He was obviously already thinking about the lemon squeezer project, because, as he waited for his food, he began to sketch on the paper place mat. At first, the sketches were just rough images of a fairly conventional form of lemon squeezer (see the centre-right area of the place mat, Figure 1.3), but then something happened to inspire a leap to making sketches of something quite different – his antipasto plate of baby squid had arrived, and Starck began to get his ‘vision of a squid-like lemon squeezer’. His sketches on the place mat now became images of strange forms with big bodies and long legs, and eventually (bottom-left in Figure 1.3) something emerged that is now recognizable as the Juicy Salif concept. The spiral body fluting for the lemon juice to flow down into a receptacle underneath was used in the first prototype but was modified to vertical fluting in the production version.\n\nLloyd and Snelders recount what probably went on in this quick process of creative sketching and thinking, as Starck drew for inspiration not only on the squid but also on his boyhood interests in sci-fi comics and spaceship imagery. ‘First he tries to make a conventional lemon squeezer out of a squid, but then he realises that\n\nFIGURE 1.3 Philippe Starck’s design sketches for the lemon squeezer on the restaurant place mat. Courtesy of Philippe Starck.\n\n17\n\n18\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nwon’t really work. The squid begins to evolve . . . into something with legs, but he doesn’t like it. It seems to be dragging, injured almost.’ Here, one might interject, Starck seems to be using his pencil, like Richard MacCormac, in a process of discovery and invention.\n\nHe keeps going, eating while he sketches. His sketches abstractly remind him of the old comics he used to read . . . Things begin to gel in his mind, and from the dragging creature emerges a lighter, three-legged form . . . He likes the form, it’s ‘working’ . . . The next morning he phones Alessi, ‘I’ve got a lemon squeezer for you’, he teases. Of course there are a few details to work out, exact dimensions, what material to use, how to get the juice out of the lemon efficiently. But . . . the main problem is solved.\n\nSo we see that the concept for the strange new type of lemon squeezer did not leap fully formed into Philippe Starck’s mind but emerged, albeit rather quickly, in a process of sketching inspired by seeing a squid shape as a potential source of form and driven by recall of other imagery. This other imagery comes from some of Philippe’s other interests, including aircraft design (his father’s occupation), space rockets, science fiction and comic strips. Lloyd and Snelders suggest that Philippe has retained a kind of juvenile enthusiasm for futuristic imagery of space rockets and alien invaders.\n\nIn deconstructing Philippe Starck’s design activity from his sketches, Lloyd and Snelders implied that the ‘squid-like’ concept was not an inexplicable flash of inspiration from nowhere, but that it arose rather more prosaically by applying an analogy (the form of a squid) to the problem that was on Philippe’s mind (a novel form for a lemon squeezer). This kind of analogy-making is often proposed as a means of encouraging creative thinking. What was particularly striking in this case was Starck’s ability to make such a leap of imagination from ‘squid’ to ‘lemon squeezer’. Thereafter, Lloyd and Snelders suggested, Philippe, in developing the concept, was doing what many designers do, which is to draw upon a repertoire of precedents, knowledge of other similar objects, remembered images and recollections; in this case perhaps images of tripodic alien creatures from science fiction, that helped him to give a more coherent form to the concept. This deconstruction of Philippe Starck’s design process is represented in Figure 1.4.\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\nFIGURE 1.4 The Juicy Salif design process deconstructed. Anti-clockwise from bottom right: initial thoughts around conventional lemon squeezers; analogical inspiration from the form of a squid; improvement of the form; recall of precedent forms from science-fiction; the final concept and the finished product. Courtesy of Philippe Starck.\n\nWatching what designers do\n\nA more direct form of enquiry into understanding what designers do is actually to watch them at work, observing their activities in real time. Such studies not only report on what was observed to happen but also try to add another layer of explanation of the nature of designing. Larry Bucciarelli made a series of extensive studies of engineering design projects in three different companies. Large projects demand an important aspect of design ability, that of reconciling the variety of interests – technical, financial, social, aesthetic and so on – that inevitably have to coalesce around a major project. In these cases, designing becomes not just a personal, cognitive process, but a collaborative, social process. The main conclusion that Bucciarelli stressed is how even engineering design, traditionally seen as a\n\n19\n\n20\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nstrictly technical process, is in reality a social process of interaction and negotiation between the different participants who each bring to bear their own ‘object world’, that is, their own specific knowledge and awareness of aspects of the object being designed. His thesis is that ‘the process of designing is a process of achieving consensus among participants with different “interests” in the design, and that those different interests are not reconcilable in object-world terms . . . The process is necessarily social and requires the participants to negotiate their differences and construct meaning through direct, and preferably face-to-face, exchange’. The social nature of teamwork, he suggested, results in acknowledging the inevitability of uncertainty and ambiguity, even within the process of engineering design. ‘Ambiguity is essential to design process, allowing participants the freedom to manoeuvre independently within object worlds and providing room for the recasting of meaning in the negotiations with others.’\n\nPeter Rowe made a set of observations of architects at work. These studies were of the design processes of three major buildings in American cities, designed by leading architects. Rowe noticed in all three studies that the architects’ attention switched regularly between solution concepts and problem exploration – between developing ideas for building form and investigating the implications of those ideas in terms of the design brief and technical feasibility. He characterized the progress of the design activity as ‘episodic’ or as a kind of ‘series of related skirmishes with various aspects of the problem at hand’. This episodic structure was manifest in a number of ways:\n\nFirst, there is the ‘to and fro’ movement between areas of concern . . . a movement back and forth between exploration of architectural form and evaluation of programme [brief], structure, and other technical issues. Second, there seem to be periods of unfettered speculation, followed by more sober and contemplative episodes during which the designer ‘takes stock of the situation’. Third, each episode seems to have a particular orientation that preoccupies the designer. We might say that the organising principles involved in each episode take on a life of their own, as the designer becomes absorbed in exploring the possibilities that they promise.\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\nThis sounds like the typically ‘exploratory’ approach of the designer – seeking opportunities that offer ways to progress, pushing ahead along promising paths and pausing from time to time to evaluate what has been achieved so far. But Rowe made a criticism of this way of proceeding; it seemed to him to be unnecessarily chancy, and inefficient. ‘These episodes’, he commented, ‘such as the various massing exercises with building volumes, often became very speculative as the designer “pressed on”, as it were, when information from another quarter might have resolved the problem at hand more economically. Such situations often subsequently gave rise to a certain amount of backtracking, as the designer retrenched to what seemed a more advantageous position.’ It is as though the designer adopts a blinkered approach, overly focused on a particular solution concept, and doggedly ‘pressing on’ when a more considered and reflective approach, and consideration of alternative solution concepts, might save time and effort in the long run. Why should experienced designers behave in this apparently restricted way? It could be that they have to invest significant cognitive effort in generating these concepts and so they are reluctant to let go of them.\n\nThe most influential study of a designer at work has been that by Donald Schön. The influence of the study is largely due to it being set within Schön’s broader series of studies of professional practice (ranging from psychotherapy to management) that he used to establish his theory of reflective practice, or ‘how professionals think in action’. The study has also been influential because Schön’s analysis of what he observed is acute and sensitive; designers and design researchers (those with personal design experience) recognize the veracity of the analysis. What is surprising is that such an influential study is based on just one, partial example of design activity – and even that is not a ‘real’ design example but is taken from observing an experienced designer tutor a student in a university architectural design studio.\n\nSchön established his theory of reflective practice as a counter to a more prevalent theory of technical rationality or the constrained application of scientific theory and technique to practical problems. He was seeking a new understanding that would help explain and account for how competent practitioners actually engage with their\n\n21",

In his analysis of the case studies that provided the foundations for his theory, he began with the assumption that ‘competent practitioners usually know more than they can say. They exhibit a kind of knowing-in-practice, most of which is tacit’. He identified a cognitive process of reflection-in-action as the intelligence that guides ‘intuitive’ behaviour in practical contexts of thinking and acting – something like ‘thinking on your feet’. At the heart of reflection-in-action is the ‘frame experiment’ in which the practitioner frames, or poses a way of seeing the problematic situation at hand, or finds a way into the problem, something like Jane Darke’s ‘primary generator’.\n\n‘a reflective conversation with the situation’, an interactive process based on posing a problem frame and exploring its implications in ‘moves’ that investigate the emerging solution possibilities. A designer, he argued, is faced with a situation of complexity.\n\nAccording to Schön, designing proceeds as\n\nBecause of this complexity, the designer’s moves tend, happily or unhappily, to produce consequences other than those intended. When this happens, the designer may take account of the unintended changes he has made in the situation by forming new appreciations and understandings and by making new moves. He shapes the situation, in accordance with his initial appreciation of it, the situation ‘talks back’, and he responds to the situation’s back-talk.\n\nThe design example that Schön analysed was that of a tutor, ‘Quist’, an experienced architect, helping a student, ‘Petra’, with her problem of designing a school on a sloping site. Because Quist has to explain his own thinking to Petra, his words, and the sketches he makes at the same time, give an insight into his cognitive processes, his reflection-in-action. The talking (i.e. the thinking) and the drawing go on in parallel, as other designers have said.\n\nPetra is ‘stuck’ in the early part of her design process: she has drawn a series of connected, L-shaped classroom blocks, but she has a problem fitting them to the site. ‘I’ve tried to butt the shape of the building into the contours of the land there – but the shape doesn’t\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\nfit into the slope’, she explains. Quist suggests that she stops trying to stick so closely to the site’s contours, and instead that she should seek to impose her building geometry onto the site. ‘You should begin with a discipline’, he says, ‘even if it is arbitrary . . . you can always break it open later.’ Quist starts to sketch in plan and section, exploring the implications of the ‘discipline’ of form that he is now imposing on the site. As he explores, he begins to find some of those ‘new appreciations and understandings’ in the design. With his more aggressive approach to the site, he sees how, in section, across the fall of the site,\n\nWe get a total differential potential here from one end of the classroom to the far end of the other. There is fifteen feet max, right – so we could have as much as five-foot intervals, which for a kid is maximum height, right? The section through here could be one of nooks in here and the differentiation between this unit and this would be at two levels.\n\nThe idea of ‘kid-height nooks’ is something that Quist discovers as a potential in his solution concept, not something that was in the design brief; it is an emergent property of his designing. In Schön’s terms, it is an ‘unintended change’ in the situation, which Quist interprets as a positive indicator of the appropriateness of the problem frame that he has set up. A little later, as he continues designing, other positive aspects are spotted and reinforced in the emerging design – and even the qualities of the site come back into play, as here: ‘Let the land generate some sub-ideas here, which could be very nice. Maybe the cafeteria needn’t be such a formal function – maybe it could come into here to get summer sun here and winter here.’\n\nOne thing Quist demonstrates is that he has the confidence to ask ‘what if?’ What if we carve the L-shaped blocks more deeply into the site? What if we work with a system of five-feet height intervals? What if we create a gallery-level circulation space? These ‘what if’ conjectures are the ‘moves’ that Schön identified:\n\nEach has implications binding on later moves. And each creates new problems to be described and solved. Quist designs by spinning out a web of moves, consequences, implications, appreciations,\n\n23\n\n24\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nand further moves . . . Each move is a local experiment which contributes to the global experiment of reframing the problem . . . As Quist reflects on the unexpected consequences and implications of his moves, he listens to the situation’s back-talk, forming new appreciations which guide his further moves.\n\nAs designing proceeds, the sketches become a record of the moves and their implications. Many things remain tentative, but some are selected as positive outcomes of the ‘what if?’ conjectures and are given temporary identities as features to be retained. Schön suggested that these are choice-points within the process.\n\nAs he reflects-in-action on the situation created by his earlier moves, the designer must consider not only the present choice but the tree of further choices to which it leads, each of which has different meanings in relation to the systems of implications set up by earlier moves. Quist’s virtuosity lies in his ability to string out design webs of great complexity. But even he cannot hold in mind an indefinitely expanding web. At some point, he must move from a ‘what if?’ to a decision which then becomes a design node with binding implications for further moves. Thus there is a continually evolving system of implications within which the designer reflects-in-action.\n\nWhat we gain from Schön’s analysis is a clear account of a typical, fast moving, ‘thinking on your feet’, live example of designing. The initial problematic situation is ‘framed’ by the designer. Quist’s framing adopts the given of Petra’s starting point of a series of linked L-shaped blocks (he is tutoring her in how to develop her solution idea, not starting from scratch with his own idea) and poses the implicit question, ‘How can we make these blocks fit into the sloping site in a coherent way?’ He works through a series of thinking-actions of moving-seeing-moving; that is, of posing a ‘what if?’ move, looking at what results (in his sketches), reflecting on the consequences (good or bad), and making another, related move. One move leads to another, through the medium of the sketches, which not only record the process of moves but also provoke thoughts and initiate new moves.\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\nSomething similar must have been happening in Rowe’s studies of architectural design, even though the design projects were on a much larger scale. The designers spin out a complex web of inter- related moves, reflections, decisions and further moves. They invest a great deal of cognitive effort in spinning and maintaining these webs, and so perhaps it is no wonder that they are reluctant to ‘stand back and adopt a fresh point of departure’. But sometimes it is necessary; a problem frame can prove to be inappropriate, or the designer lacks the ability to maintain a positive sequence of moves within the frame, and so a new departure point, a new problem frame becomes necessary.\n\nAn aspect of Schön’s study that helps to make it particularly informative is that it is based on the ‘live’ data of Quist’s talking and drawing. Because he is tutoring, Quist externalizes his thinking for the benefit of the student, when normally it would be a silent, internal cognitive process. This therefore provides an example of something like a ‘think-aloud’ protocol study, of the type which has come to be used extensively to investigate how designers think. The ‘protocols’ are the sequence of thoughts, reflected in the comments made by the designer. These protocol studies are normally conducted as a laboratory type of study, in which a designer is asked to ‘think aloud’ as he or she works through a short design project. Detailed evidence from these kinds of study will be used frequently in the later chapters of this book.\n\nThese various studies of design in action, based on watching what designers do, have tended to confirm what designers say about the nature of designing. There is the need to tolerate and work with uncertainty, to have the confidence to conjecture and explore, to interact constructively with sketches and models, and to rely upon one’s ‘intuitive’ powers of reflection-in-action.\n\nThinking about what designers do\n\nThe criticisms that Peter Rowe made of the way that designers tended to cling for too long to solution conjectures that were proving inadequate have also been reflected in comments by others. This and other early criticisms of the typical ways that designers work\n\n25\n\n26\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nled to attempts to provide design methods or guidelines that would encourage designers to work more ‘rationally’. Such guidelines generally outline a systematic procedure of first analysing the problem as fully as possible, then breaking this into sub-problems, finding suitable sub-solutions, evaluating these and then selecting and combining them into an overall solution. It is basically a process of analysis-synthesis-evaluation. However, this kind of procedure has been criticized in the design world because it seems to be based on inappropriate models imported from theories of problem-solving and ‘rational behaviour’, and therefore runs counter to designers’ more ‘intuitive’ ways of thinking and reasoning.\n\nSeveral theoretical arguments have been advanced in support of the view that design reasoning is different from the conventionally acknowledged forms of inductive and deductive reasoning. For example, Lionel March distinguished design’s mode of reasoning from those of logic and science. He pointed out: ‘Logic has interests in abstract forms. Science investigates extant forms. Design initiates novel forms. A scientific hypothesis is not the same thing as a design hypothesis. A logical proposition is not to be mistaken for a design proposal. A speculative design cannot be determined logically, because the mode of reasoning involved is essentially abductive.’\n\nMarch argued that the two conventionally understood forms of reasoning – deductive and inductive – only apply logically to analytical and evaluative types of activity. But the type of activity that is most particularly associated with design is that of synthesis, for which there is no commonly acknowledged form of reasoning. March drew on the work of the philosopher C. S. Peirce to identify this missing concept of abductive reasoning. According to Peirce, ‘Deduction proves that something must be; induction shows that something actually is operative; abduction suggests that something may be.’ It is this hypothesizing of what may be, the act of producing proposals or conjectures, appropriate to the situation that is central to designing.\n\nDeductive reasoning is the reasoning of formal logic: if you know a is the same as b, and b is the same as c, then you know that a must be the same as c. Inductive reasoning is the logic of science: you observe all the swans in a given region; you note that each and every swan is white; so you form a rule that ‘all swans are white’ (which you\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\nmay find is false when you move to another region and observe some black swans). Abduction is the logic of design: you are asked to design a telephone for mature people; you know that mature people like clarity and elegant forms and colours; so you propose a design with a smoothly contoured, silver case and clear, black buttons (one of many possible proposals for achieving clarity and elegance).\n\nInstead of ‘abductive’ reasoning, Lionel March preferred to call designing ‘productive reasoning’ because the designer has to produce a design. ‘Appositional reasoning’ also seems to be a suitable term to use, because the designer makes a proposal for a solution that, when juxtaposed with the problem, seems to be an apposite response. Unlike conventional reasoning, a design solution cannot be derived directly from the problem, but can only be matched to it. Unlike the scientist, who searches for many cases to substantiate a rule, and then one case to falsify it, the designer can be gratified in being able to produce just one satisfactory case that gives an appropriate result.\n\nA comprehensive analysis of why the classic methods of reasoning in problem-solving are inappropriate in design has been provided by Henrik Gedenryd. Working from a cognitive science perspective, and applying it especially in the context of interaction design, Gedenryd argued against the view of cognition as a purely rational, ‘intra-mental’ (i.e. solely within the mind) activity and in favour of recognizing it as a practical, interactive activity. He concluded that ‘the mind working on its own is only a circumscribed portion of the full cognitive system’; the full system comprises mind, action and world, or a combination of thinking and acting within a physical environment. The designer’s natural way of working encompasses that larger system through interacting with temporary models of the situation being designed for. The range of design techniques, such as sketching, prototyping, mock-ups, scenarios, enables the designer to make ‘an inquiry into the future situation of use’. These techniques ‘make the world a part of cognition’ and provide the designer with a set of ‘situating strategies’. Hence, Gedenryd provided a theoretical understanding of the important role of these techniques and strategies in design. He showed that abstract thought alone cannot satisfactorily perform the complex task of designing.\n\n27\n\n28\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nUnderstanding what designers do\n\nWhat designers try to express about their own processes of designing remains largely tacit knowledge – that is they know it in the same way that a skilled person ‘knows’ how to perform that skill. The most significant outcomes from the varied studies and research into what designers do have been not only the growth of more explicit and articulated knowledge but also a greater understanding of and respect for all the designerly ways of knowing, acting and thinking that are at the core of design ability. The studies, research and reflection have also contributed to building a view of design as a cognitive discipline – a way of thinking – as well as a professional practice. This view has grown from a research-based understanding of the nature of design ability, from analysis of its strengths and weaknesses, and from a desire to support and nurture that ability.\n\nAs we have seen, one way of studying design thinking that has helped particularly to develop that better understanding has been through case studies of designers at work. This approach tries to establish the strategies, the modes of thinking and acting that designers actually use in practice. This fieldwork and case-study approach accepts that there is much to be learned from the natural, learned and practised ways that designers actually think and work.\n\nThe next part of this book begins a series of case studies of designers and design activities that will occur throughout the book. The case studies are intended to provide resources for the study of high-quality design thinking, with information and data drawn from both interviews and experimental investigations. In the next two chapters we will study two outstanding designers; the chapters are based on my own interviews and conversations with the designers.\n\nSummary\n\nDesigners typically report their ability as being based on intuitive, almost unconscious ways of thinking, but their feeling of ease is likely to be a result of considerable experience. Some apparently intuitive designing can be understood as being much less mysterious, based\n\nDESIGN ABILITY\n\non techniques of creative thinking and designers’ prior knowledge. In design, problems and solutions are closely interwoven; a potential solution proposal may lead to rethinking the problem, and designers are used to accepting and coping with this kind of uncertainty. The use of external representations of solution ideas in the graphic language of sketches, drawings, and other kinds of models assists with the translation of abstract requirements into physical objects and may be a necessary part of the generation and exploration of ideas. The interaction between the designer and the representations has been characterized as ‘a reflective conversation with the situation’. Designers are solution-focused thinkers, using conjectures of initial solution ideas to provide a focus for further exploration. A possible problem with this is that conjectures might be made too early and become restrictive of wider exploration. Professional designing is a form of reflective practice, involving a process of framing a problem, pursuing a dialogue with and through the making of representations, and reflecting upon the implications and discoveries that emerge. The logic of design thinking is not that of the usual, well-understood formal logics but a form of abductive logic.\n\nSources\n\nFull citations are given in the References.\n\nLarry Bucciarelli: Designing Engineers.

He joined the Brabham Formula One racing car team as a designer-draughtsman and was rapidly promoted to chief designer. For twelve years he carried the major responsibility for the design of a series of innovative and frequently successful racing cars. Brabham cars designed by Gordon Murray and driven by Nelson Piquet won two World Championships. In 1987 Gordon Murray then moved to the McLaren Formula One team as technical director. Through the four race seasons from 1988 to 1991, McLaren cars designed by Murray and his team won three World Championships with driver Ayrton Senna and a fourth with driver Alain Prost. In total, Gordon Murray’s cars won fifty-one Grands Prix races.\n\nGordon Murray then became technical director of McLaren Cars Limited, an off-shoot of the Formula One team, and became responsible for the design and development of a completely new, road-going ‘supercar’ – the McLaren F1, designed on the same rigorous principles as a Formula One car. As well as many technical innovations, the F1 featured a novel seating arrangement, with the driver positioned centrally and two passenger seats beside but slightly behind the driver, in an ‘arrowhead’ configuration (Figure 2.1).\n\n32\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 2.1 (a) Gordon Murray’s sketch for the McLaren F1, showing the three-person seating arrangement with passengers slightly behind the central driver; (b) overhead view of the McLaren F1; (c) detail drawing side/ cutaway-view of the McLaren F1. Courtesy of Gordon Murray/McLaren Automotive.\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\nAfter leaving McLaren, Gordon Murray established his own automotive design consultancy and has extended his career into a wide variety of vehicle forms, ranging from high-performance sports cars to small, efficient city cars, autonomous vehicles and a flat- packed truck for developing countries.\n\nBackground: Formula One designing\n\nFormula One racing car design is significantly different from almost every other kind of design domain. Gordon Murray likens it to war. Engineering and technological development in wartime is the closest analogy to Formula One he can think of, with resources – human, financial and technical – being poured into the design and construction of machines that must have, and maintain, a vital performance edge over those of the opposition. Throughout the nine-month Formula One season there is a battle to be fought on a different field every other week, with a new campaign starting again every year.\n\nThis constant competitive atmosphere creates tremendous pressure, particularly on someone in the position that Gordon Murray was in for many years at Brabham of being totally in control of, and responsible for, the complete technical operation: designing, constructing, testing, racing and organizing, throughout the year, and from one year to the next. With the calendar of Grand Prix races fixed in advance, there is also constant time pressure, with no possibility of missing a race or practice session.\n\nThroughout a Formula One racing season there is constant work to make continuous improvements and adjustments to the current car design. These may be responses to obvious shortcomings, such as component failures, or to assessments of the car’s performance and handling, either in general or in relation to certain features of certain race circuits. The performance improvements aimed for may seem incredibly tiny by other standards – perhaps one-tenth of a second per lap – but they can make the difference between winning or losing the race. And at the same time, every other team is also making constant improvements, so the situation is never static.\n\n33\n\n34\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nRadical innovation\n\nBeyond continually making improvements during the season, there is a limit to what can be achieved with any car design before a jump has to be made to basically a new design. As Gordon Murray says, ‘Given the situation and the pressure at any one time, you do get to a brick wall. I mean, you’re doing all these normal modifications, you know you can’t go any quicker, you need to make the step forward.’ Typically, such a step forward happens during the short close-season, when every team seeks to start the coming new season with an advantage over its rivals.\n\nIn many instances, and for most teams, this will be a new version of the previous season’s car; perhaps a new chassis, new suspension or a new engine to be accommodated; perhaps a change in regulations to be met. For Gordon Murray it would often mean trying a ‘step forward’, a radical new concept. In the midst of the pressure, the fervour, the panic, he ‘used to get breakthroughs, I mean I used to get like suddenly a mental block’s lifted’. These breakthroughs would come as a sudden illumination: ‘I know it’s a cliché, but I really did have a lot of good ideas in the bath!’ But such illuminations came, again in classical form, after long periods of immersion in, and preoccupation with the problem.\n\nIn Formula One there are always strict design requirements to be met: the technical and sporting regulations, which minutely and precisely specify the physical and operational limits within which the teams must compete, and which can change from season to season. Gordon Murray regards the constraints (the regulations) of racing car design, along with its intense pressure and competition, as fundamental to the necessity to innovate. Outside of racing car design he thinks that there may not be enough pressure on the designer, nor tight enough regulations, nor strong enough competition, for such radical, innovative design thinking as in Formula One.\n\nAnother crucial factor is the necessity and the motivation to carry through the bright idea into detailed implementation. Again, intense pressure, even in the close-season, ensures that ideas that look certain to be winners will be pushed through to detailed implementation with the same fervour as in the racing season. Other possibly good\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\nideas are discarded on a rapid evaluation of their implications for a car’s weight, performance or handling. In Formula One design, it is a matter not just of having ideas but of really implementing ideas that are going to improve performance, of having to ‘do it’, as Gordon says, ‘You have the idea, but you have to do it, and that’s what cuts the bullshit out.’\n\nSelf-adjusting suspension\n\nAs one example of radical innovation, Gordon Murray refers to the development at Brabham of a novel suspension system. At the time, the then Formula One governing body, FISA, became concerned to reduce the designed-in ‘ground effect’ on the cars. This effect had been pioneered on the Lotus team’s cars; smooth underbodies lying very close to the ground, side skirts right down to the ground and careful aerodynamic design provided a low-pressure under-car area which increased the car’s grip on the track surface. This meant much higher cornering speeds were possible, to the extent that some people became worried about the heavy g-force effects that were being imposed on the drivers, which might cause them to loose consciousness. FISA decided to ban the ‘sliding’ skirts that kept the body-ground gap closed but allowed fixed skirts and set a minimum underbody ground clearance of 6 centimetres. For Gordon Murray this sudden change in regulations was a stimulus to innovation. His first World Championship-winning car, he said,\n\ncame absolutely from the regulation change. You sit there and you read the regulations and think, how we are going to do it? How the hell can we get ground-effect back? What [the regulations] said was ‘At all times the car will have a 6 centimetre gap between the bodywork and the ground . . . and there can be no driver-operated device to change that gap’. And everybody looked at it, and built cars with 6 centimetre gaps . . . and I looked at it and I thought, if that 6 centimetre gap could be a 1 centimetre gap I could double the ground effect on the car; and it’s going to go down to a 1 centimetre gap at some point, like [under braking] at the end of the straight. So if I can make a physical thing . . . that drives the car down on its own, and holds the car down on its own without\n\n35\n\n36\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nany mechanical aid or button or electrics or anything, it’s legal. So in three months we developed a hydro-pneumatic suspension system.\n\nGordon Murray’s thinking on this, and he says it came as a sudden illumination, was that the authorities had to accept that at some points during a race, any car’s ground clearance is going to be less than the 6 centimetres minimum simply because of the body dipping under braking, or rolling in corners and so on. Knowing that any driver- operated, mechanical device to alter the ground clearance was illegal, he focused on the physical forces, the ‘bits of nature’, that act on a car in motion. The downforce from air pressure on a moving car could, if the car was appropriately designed aerodynamically, push the car down over its whole length and width. The design challenge, therefore, was to let the natural downforce push the car down at speed, and then somehow to keep it down as it travelled around the circuit, but then allow the car to return to 6 centimetres clearance at standstill.\n\nThe ingenious solution used a hydro-pneumatic suspension system for the first time in Formula One, with struts at each wheel connected to hydraulic fluid reservoirs. As the car went faster, the natural downforce of airflow pushed the body lower on its suspension and the fluid in each suspension strut was pushed out into the reservoirs. The trick then was to find a way of letting the fluid return to the suspension struts only very slowly when the car slowed down. By the end of the first lap, the car body would be lower and would stay low, but on slowing down and stopping at the end of the race, the fluid would return from the reservoirs into the suspension struts, and the body would rise to the required 6 centimetres ground clearance.\n\nGordon Murray found how to achieve the required result in the\n\ntechnology of micro-filters, used mainly in the medical industry.\n\nThey were using these organic micro-filters which let the fluid through themselves but very, very, very, slowly. And we built the world’s tiniest throttle valve with one of these filters in it, and a tiny little pin – we were using drills that you couldn’t even see! We went and quickly developed what size hole we needed, so that it took a\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\nlap to push the fluid through these little holes – all naturally with the downforce – pushed the fluid into the reservoirs and the car was stuck on the ground, running with its skirts virtually touching the ground. And because it took so long for the fluid to get back through the same valves and filters, it held the car down there, and after the race you have the slowing down lap . . . and the car just slowly came back up. Nothing to do with the driver at all, just physical forces. And we went to the first race in Argentina and just blew everybody into the weeds, just totally; and everybody went bananas!\n\nOther teams protested that the Brabham cars must have been fitted with a driver-operated device. It was obvious that the cars were lower during racing than they were in the pits, but of course the scrutineers could find no illegal device. Under pressure from the other teams, the authorities pointed out that the Brabham cars were clearly lower than 6 centimetres when out on the circuit, which contravened the regulations, but Gordon countered that, at various points, so was every other car. To curb the protests, he suggested to the authorities that every car could have its underbody painted, and at the end of the race every car which showed that at some point the underbody had rubbed the ground should be disqualified; and of course, the other teams would not accept this. Some other teams experimented haphazardly with variable suspension systems, but, very frustratingly for Gordon, just a few races later in the season, FISA reversed its stance and allowed driver-operated devices for controlling suspension height.\n\nThe Brabham self-adjusting suspension system was an example of an innovation initiated by a change in regulations which forced Gordon Murray’s thinking on how to retain the ground effect. It is an example of radical design innovation, through thinking from first principles about the effects of natural forces and having the motivation to follow through from a basic idea into finely detailed implementation.\n\nPit stops\n\nAnother example of radical innovation by Gordon Murray was the Brabham team’s introduction of planned pit stops for refuelling during\n\n37\n\n38\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\na race, before this became normal practice (and was eventually ruled out from the 2010 season, although still allowed for tyre changes). This was not so much an innovation in the car design per se but reflects more of a systems approach to the overall goal of winning each race. At that time it was not normal to have pit stops as regular, planned parts of the race routine and team strategy. Pit stops were for emergencies such as changing a punctured or badly worn tyre. For Gordon Murray, the innovation of introducing planned pit stops was part of an overall strategy arising from taking his thinking back to a basic issue – how to make the car lighter. The lighter the car, the faster it is in accelerating and decelerating.\n\nGordon says his mind was ‘banging away’ at this issue for a long time. He looked at the regulations and realized that there was nothing in them about when you could put fuel into the car. So the idea dawned of running the car with only a little over half the normal, full-race fuel load and including a pit stop for refuelling. But that was only the starting point for a thorough investigation of the implications of such an idea and of working through the detailed implementation. The first thing to do was to evaluate the implications of the idea. A pit stop took a lot of time; not only was there the actual stopped time of the car at the pits, but there was also the time lost in decelerating and driving into the pits and also in accelerating away again on tyres that take a couple of laps to heat up to optimum operating temperature. Formula One pit stops eventually became refined down to an incredibly quick norm of about six seconds actual stopped time, in which time over 100 litres of fuel were taken on and all four wheels changed. The total racing time lost was perhaps some twenty seconds. Gordon calculated that if the total racing time lost by a pit stop was less than twenty-six seconds, there could be sufficient advantage gained elsewhere to make it worthwhile.\n\nThere were many factors that came into calculating the advantage. As well as the weight reduction, half-size fuel tanks also have an advantage over full-size ones in that the car’s weight distribution is lower, and is more constant throughout the race, and the roll-couple on corners is lower, allowing faster cornering. The complicated choices of harder or softer tyre compounds also become a critical factor, because a lighter car can run on softer compounds which also improve cornering speeds. Even the psychology of racing came into\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\nit, because a car with obvious advantages in the early part of a race could lead other competing drivers into pushing their cars harder, or into taking more risks. For all of the objective, measurable factors, fine calculations were made, leading to the conclusion that a pit stop had to lose less than twenty-six seconds of racing time to be worthwhile. At that time, a quick pit stop for tyre changes took about fifteen seconds of actual stopped time. Gordon Murray calculated that he had to get this down to about ten seconds and to reduce as much as possible the slowing-down and warming-up times. And so, ‘the innovation process continues, because you’ve got all these new things that nobody’s done before that you have to come up with’. An extraordinary development programme had to be undertaken in an incredibly short time.\n\nFrom having the first idea to having a pit-stop car running and doing a test was three or four weeks, and that’s all the time that you have. So you would take each individual thing and tackle it. Say, OK, how can we get thirtyfive gallons into the car in ten seconds? The only way you’re ever going to do it is using pressure, and then you have a crash programme to develop a system . . . That’s what is great about race car design, because even though you’ve had the big idea – the ‘light bulb’ thing, which is fun – the real fun is actually taking these individual things, that nobody’s every done before, and in no time at all try and think of a way of designing them. And not only think of a way of doing them, but drawing the bits, having them made and testing them.\n\nWithin three weeks, they had thought of, designed, made and tested a pressure-fed refuelling system. To improve pit-stop procedures, Gordon hired a film crew to film the team practising pit stops and then played back the film, stopping it to identify difficulties and errors, and devising ways to improve the procedures. The new systems, the improvements and the training of the pit team got the actual stopped time down to under the target of ten seconds. One ‘big killer’ remained:\n\nWhen you put new tyres on they were cold, and it always took two laps to get back up to speed, and the time you lost in those two\n\n39\n\n40\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nlaps killed the whole thing. So then I thought, well I know the tyres start working at seventy degrees centigrade . . . so we designed an oven, a wooden oven with a gas-fired heater, and we heated the tyres up, and ten seconds before the car was coming in we opened the oven door, whipped the tyres out, put them on, and the guy was instantly quick. Now every Grand Prix team has tyre heating; that’s where it started.\n\nPit stops to change all four wheels and tyres with varying hard or soft compounds (with a stopped time of just a couple of seconds) are now a key factor in race strategy for every Formula One team.\n\nThe example of the introduction of the ‘pit-stop car’ illustrates how a radical innovation was driven by the competitive urge to find a significant advantage within the constraints of the regulations; how the basic creative idea had to be evaluated on precise calculations; how a total systems approach was adopted; and how implementation had to be carried through to fine levels of detail.\n\nDesigning from first principles\n\nAs well as the competitive pressure and the tight constraints, Gordon Murray emphasizes that an important factor in innovative design is reconsidering the problem situation from first principles; he stresses the need to ‘keep looking back at fundamental physical principles’. His innovative suspension system was based on such fundamental physical principles as the natural air-pressure downforce on a fast- moving car. The McLaren F1 sports car was also conceived according to the principles of Formula One design – principles such as lightness of materials, rigour of construction and optimization of performance. These principles were proved when some GTR racing versions of the F1 were produced; at their first outing, in the 1995 Le Mans twenty- four-hours race, McLaren F1s came first, third, fourth and fifth.\n\nThe unconventional ‘arrowhead’ seating layout (see Figure 2.1) also came from first principles. It is based on the racing principle of placing the driver at the centre of the car and is something he has used again in other car designs. It was something that Gordon Murray had had in mind for many years, as evidenced by a sketch for a car\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\ndesign with the same layout in one of his student notebooks, some twenty-five years earlier. The seating layout is a very visible example of how he is prepared always to think anew about any aspect of the car that he is designing.\n\nSteering column\n\nAs a less-visible example of his approach to designing from first principles, Gordon Murray refers to a small, and perhaps seemingly insignificant, part of the McLaren F1, the steering column. ‘Conventionally, it would have been, right, steering columns are typically three-quarter-inch solid steel bars.’ He explained how this conventional solution arises because the column not only has to carry torsional forces from the resistance to the turning wheels but also bending loads from the driver leaning and pulling on it whilst getting in and out of the car. It also has conventional points of support, is mounted in rubber bushes to reduce noise and is encased in a plastic housing for reasons of appearance and convenience. But it does not provide the sort of direct steering feel that a racing driver needs and that feeling was supposed to be one of the principles embodied in the design of the McLaren F1.\n\nSo Gordon decided to start by separating the needs to carry both torque and bending loads. Whatever the form of the steering column itself, it still needs a cover to house electrical cables and to mount switches, ‘so if you’ve got to have that anyway, why not use the insect principle where the skeleton’s on the outside, and make that the structure that takes all the bending forces?’ This thinking led to the design of the steering column itself as an aluminium tube of just 1 millimetre wall thickness, possible because it is only taking torque and not tension or compression. The support point is closer behind the steering wheel rather than down at the dashboard, and the system is now much lighter but stronger than a conventional solution and also has the right racing feel (Figure 2.2). The design process stemmed from considering first principles – separating the torque and bending loads – and from an imaginative breakthrough – using the housing cover for structural purposes as well as appearance and practicality.\n\n41",

Courtesy of Gordon Murray.\n\nGordon Murray insists on keeping experience ‘at the back of your mind, not the front’ and to work from first principles when designing. For instance, in designing a standard component such as a suspension wishbone, he says, ‘It’s all too easy, and the longer you’re in design the easier it is to say, I know all about wishbones, this is how it’s going to look because that’s what wishbones look like.’ But if you want to take a step forward, if you’re looking for ways of making it much better and much lighter, then you have to go right back to first principles. He says it is like always designing things as though for the first time, rather than the n-th time.\n\nCase note: Analogical thinking\n\nIn his design of the McLaren F1 steering column, Gordon Murray\n\nused an analogy with the exoskeleton structure that some insects have. The use of analogical thinking is common in designing, with biological analogies often being used to inspire creative thinking\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\n(something like Philippe Starck’s analogical inspiration of the form of a squid for his lemon squeezer) or translated into technical applications.\n\nAnalogical thinking in design has been studied quite extensively. For example, Martin Stacey and his colleagues looked at idea creation by analogical transfer in a study of a team of designers who were generating ideas for a new product: a ‘digital pen’ using novel print-head technology. The envisaged pen might be a children’s toy or perhaps a craft or art tool. Some initial issues that were identified from an existing basic engineering prototype included keeping the print-head level and constraining the way it contacts potential printing media.\n\nHere is an extract of the team’s discussion of ideas on how to\n\ncontrol the print head and keep it flat on a variable surface:\n\nJack: A sledge manages to keep level by having quite a wide base and then a main force in the middle, unlike a set of skis which are quite narrow and you go up on an edge when you’re turning. A sledge is quite broad and you have the weight right in the middle so they manage to keep both runners on the snow.\n\nAlan: So would you potentially see some guiders down the side\n\nof it?\n\nJack: Well, I guess the easiest way to keep the pen at a right angle would be to have a set of stabilizers on it, like a bicycle. Chad: I was thinking of maybe like a flat base with a sort of universal joint like a windsurf mast. The face is quite big but it stays flat, but the bit you hold on to can be at different angles.\n\nThe analogies brought into play here are far removed from the immediate context of the design project, going from a sledge to children’s bicycle stabilizers to a windsurf mast. In this example they are all to do with controlling and guiding a flat object moving across a variable and low-friction surface. At other times, closer analogies might be used – at one point the team was discussing the unusually broad head of this pen:\n\nChad: So it’s more like a paintbrush isn’t it, like a DIY paintbrush Tom: It’s more like a roller, yeah\n\n43\n\n44\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nAnalogies are used in design thinking not only as inspiration for a specific solution idea but also as concise ways to suggest an underlying principle that might then lead to a range of solution ideas. As well as solution generation they are also used in problem identification and formulation and to explain or elaborate in communicating a concept.\n\nSource: Martin Stacey, et al.: From Ronchamp by Sledge, in About Designing.\n\nIntegrated design\n\nGordon Murray is known principally as a racing car designer. But for many years he nursed a very different concept of what a car could be: a small, cheap, efficient city car. After he left McLaren he began development of this very different kind of car in his own design company. The resulting concept was announced as the T.25 city car. The T.25 is a very practical urban-use vehicle that can carry a driver with two passengers or with a large amount of luggage or shopping; it is light and agile, with good performance and low fuel consumption, and occupies one-third of the road or parking space of a conventional car.\n\nFor this car Gordon Murray also developed an innovative manufacturing process, which is as important to the project as the innovative automotive design concept. This integrated thinking was essential to his approach to designing a low-cost solution, as he explained:\n\nYou need something that is small, light, radical, efficient, and it has to be cheap, because one thing you can’t do is build the world’s most sophisticated little city car that will save the world and then say to people it costs £20,000, because you won’t sell many – if you don’t sell enough it won’t make a difference, and the way you reduce the cost of producing a car and therefore the retail price is by first of all reducing the part count, the number of parts that go into the car, and that you do by design and by conceptual design.\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\nSo for Gordon Murray conceptual design, detail design and manufa- cturing are all tightly bound together.\n\nCity car\n\nGordon Murray’s motivation for designing the T.25 city car was not just the economic and environmental advantages it might offer but also a desire to design an efficient, small car that would be attractive and fun to drive and would radically impact traffic problems such as congestion. His aim was to develop not just a new type of car but a new concept of personal transport.\n\nJust as in his racing car design work, the city car is also designed from first principles. This is clear in some of Gordon’s earliest sketches for the car, in which he pays special attention to the suspension system (Figure 2.3). The suspension system is an important feature in early considerations because a tall, narrow car such as the T.25 tends to roll sideways on corners and that has to be countered in the suspension system. He also explained that, for economy, ‘I want to\n\nFIGURE 2.3 Some of Gordon Murray’s early sketches for the city car concept: (a) overall concept, (b) a very early sketch of suspension and other details, made in a pocket notebook, around the same time as the concept sketches. Courtesy of Gordon Murray.\n\n45\n\n46\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nmake a suspension with the least number of components and moving parts; this has only three parts in the whole suspension system’. The same kind of thinking applied also, for example, to the ‘frog-eye’ style of headlight design.\n\nIt’s not just styling, it’s a practical point of view because I only want to have one sub-wiring loop for cost, so I want to put the [wing] mirror in the back of the light, so you have headlamp, parking lamp, main beam, low beam, indicators, side repeater, heating element, adjusting element for the mirror, and the mirror, on one sub-loop with one plastic plug, so you have one moulded pod that does all those things, all those functions.\n\nEven a radical concept such as the easy access, lift-up opening canopy, rather than side doors, came from the same approach.\n\nGoing from seven openings to five makes a car a lot cheaper and more rigid and lighter; going from five to three and from three to two is magic, and going down to one you can’t get any better – you’ve got to get into the car. So that sort of stuff you think about from the beginning, and that applies to lights, mirrors, instruments, wheels, brakes, everything.\n\nAfter producing many dozens of small sketches of details and concepts over several years (Figure 2.4), and experimenting with performance, using different engines in some existing small cars, the design work took a major step forward when Gordon and his team built a very simple, full-size mock-up of the car, using wire and cardboard (Figure 2.5). The final version of the city car (Figure 2.6) bore a striking resemblance to that simple mock-up. The mock-up was also a useful design tool, as it began to suggest some new possibilities. For example, Gordon’s earlier idea for the seating arrangement was for two people sitting in tandem, the passenger behind the driver. But when the mock-up was built, ‘we discovered that you could, quite easily with the same width of motor car, for short journeys, you could take three people in it’, using a similar seating layout as in the McLaren F1. Another cost-saving idea also arose from exploring\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\nFIGURE 2.4 Later sketches by Gordon Murray for the T.25 city car. Courtesy of Gordon Murray.\n\nthe mock-up, when one of the team realized that the rear-located engine could be accessed from inside the car, so avoiding the need for external access. Gordon explained:\n\nAt one stage, we were looking at having to have a boot lid to access the engine, until one of the guys said, Come and look at this, if you stand in the car you can open what is effectively your boot floor from the inside of the car, you can get to the oil and water and stuff from there – you fold up the seats, open the hatch in the floor and you are there.\n\nThe T.25 had a 660 cc petrol engine, but a T.27 electric version was developed as well. Like Gordon Murray’s Formula One cars and the McLaren F1, both the T.25 and T.27 were also winners – but for energy economy rather than speed. In 2010 the T.25 won the Royal Automobile Club’s Future Car Challenge, with a 97 miles per gallon fuel consumption over the 60-mile course from Brighton to London, and the next year the T.27 won the electric car class and best overall, with an energy consumption of just 7 kilowatt-hours, equivalent to 340 miles per gallon. In the city car design we can see\n\n47\n\n48\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 2.5 The early wire and card mock-up for the city car, showing the single opening canopy. Courtesy of Gordon Murray. Photograph by Nigel Cross.\n\nthat Gordon Murray applied the same kind of design thinking as in his racing car designs. There is a breadth of approach towards an overall, high-level goal, complemented by close attention applied across all levels right down to fine details, and all interlocking into the overall concept.\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\nFIGURE 2.6 The first prototype version of the T.25 city car. Courtesy of Gordon Murray Design.\n\nCase note: Modelling\n\nSimple models and mock-ups such as the wire and cardboard\n\nmodel of Gordon Murray’s city car are often used in exploring solution ideas. For example, in early development of a new model of vacuum cleaner within the Dyson company, the team built a simple cardboard model that attempted to combine the best ideas that had emerged from earlier individual activity and group discussions (Figure 2.7). The model is largely made from corrugated cardboard, with a thin sheet of clear plastic bent around to give an impression of the transparent dust-cyclone casing. It represents some almost- fixed decisions about how big the motor might be and how big the dust collection cylinder might be. It helps in answering questions such as: are the wheels the right size, how is access to the filter arranged, where will the cable retract to? It also facilitates and enhances communication within the team, which can begin to debate subtle changes to configurations and identify strengths and weaknesses.\n\n49",

Allowing parts of the design to be vague or unresolved has advantages: it allows the maker and the viewers to focus their attention on those elements that are under discussion or are more or less resolved, and by only vaguely modelling components the designer can build in some ambiguity. Team members might view this ambiguity in many different and positive ways, resulting in a number of interpretations and ideas from the model.\n\nAs David Mlynski, the design engineer who built the model said, ‘When I’m modelling in card I’m still exploring the problem. It’s part of my creativity. Sometimes I can draw my ideas and I use this to clarify my own thinking and to share ideas with others. But at other times I’m thinking and making at the same time. I couldn’t ask someone to make the model for me because I’m designing it as I’m making it.’\n\nFIGURE 2.7 The Dyson DC05 vacuum cleaner. (a) An early development model, (b) the production version.

He suspects that many people have bright ideas, but that they lack the experience and the motivation to\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\ncarry them through to fruition: ‘They have this great idea and then they lose interest.’\n\nHowever, he also admits that not all his racing car design innovations have been successes; he has had a share of failures, too, and is willing to learn from the experience. One of his significant failures was the Brabham ‘surface cooling’ car. This radical concept was meant to be several steps forward at once: reduction in weight, improvement in driver safety and what was meant to be a long-term technical advantage over the opposition. His imaginative idea of surface cooling was to do away with normal radiators for cooling the engine, and instead to pass the water and oil through surface heat exchangers built integrally into the monocoque structure; the ‘skin’ of the car was therefore both structure and radiator.\n\nThere were innumerable detailed implementation problems with the surface cooling features, and trials soon showed that surface cooling was not going to work. So a revamped version of the previous season’s car had to be rushed out for the new season. However, Gordon was also working on another radical innovation, related not only to cooling the engine but also to increasing the car’s ground effect. Introduced in the middle of the season, this new version became known as the ‘fan car’ because it was fitted at the rear with a large fan, primarily for cooling the engine but which also happened to extract large amounts of air from underneath the car and therefore enhance the downforce. Driven by Niki Lauda, the car easily won its first race, but, as with the attempt to increase ground effect with the hydro-pneumatic suspension system, it faced immediate protests from the other teams. The use of the fan was controversial because although engine cooling fans were legal, devices for increasing downforce were not. Gordon’s argument was that ‘If we don’t have the fan then the engine will overheat’. However, the protests were so strong and influential that the Brabham team decided not to use the fan car again after its first race. It wasn’t exactly a failure, but Gordon learned from the experience of the fan car, and much later, in 2020, introduced a more sophisticated version of the concept in the design of his new sports car, the Gordon Murray Automotive T.50 (Figure 2.8). This supercar is claimed to have the most advanced aerodynamics of any road car, offering an ultra-smooth body shape and marking a new development in ground-effect innovations\n\n51\n\n52\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 2.8 The Brabham BT46B Formula One ‘fan car’ of 1978 (above) and (below) the Gordon Murray Automotive T.50 supercar of 2020 which also uses a rear-mounted fan to control underbody airflow. Courtesy of Gordon Murray Automotive.\n\nthrough active management of the underbody airflow, controlled by its rear-mounted fan – the same feature that had been introduced years before in the ‘fan car’.\n\nAnother innovative design that failed was the last one Gordon Murray designed for Brabham, before he moved to McLaren. This car was designed to be as low as possible, with the driver almost lying flat. It involved also putting the engine into a reclined position, and this was the feature that proved not to work. Gordon said, ‘We just could not get the lay-down engine to scavenge the oil properly, and we kept losing a lot of horsepower.’ But he learned from the failure, and two years later at McLaren he was able to develop the same concept more successfully:\n\nI did a lay-down McLaren, just like at Brabham but with a Honda engine that worked, and we won fifteen out of the sixteen races. So you do have things that don’t work; but in that case it wasn’t the idea that didn’t work, I just ran out of time and money, and I took on much too much in a very short period to get it to work properly.\n\nDespite having experienced some failures and disappointments, Gordon Murray learns from failures and retains a commitment to holding on to good ideas, and re-purposing them when an opportunity arises.\n\nDESIGNING TO WIN\n\nDesign process and working methods\n\nAlthough Gordon Murray carried immense personal responsibility for the design work of his racing cars, and of course for his city car, for which he founded his own company, inevitably it involved a lot of teamwork. Clearly he has been successful in inspiring others to work with him. He likes to involve team members in the design problems and for that reason prefers to recruit all-rounders to his team: ‘I never have engineers that aren’t designers.’ He also likes to work collectively, standing around a drawing board or a mock-up discussing problems and trying ideas. For the McLaren F1 design, he installed a five-metre long drawing board in the design office, so that the car could be drawn full size, and several team members could gather round to contribute. He likes to have people around ‘to bounce ideas off’, and prefers to give them enough freedom and responsibility to feel that they are really making a worthwhile contribution to the team. His personal motivation manifests itself in a dedication which he also expects to find in the other members of his design team; he expects to appoint people who ‘if you cut them, they bleed motor oil’.\n\nGordon’s personal design process is based on starting with a quick sketch of a whole idea, which is then developed through many different refinements. He said that,\n\nI do a quick sketch of the whole idea, and then if there’s one bit that looks good, instead of rubbing other bits out, I’d put that bit to one side; I’d do it again and expand on the good bit, and drop out the bad bit, and keep doing it, doing it; and end up with all these sketches, and eventually you end up throwing ninety percent of these away.\n\nHe also talks to himself – or rather, writes notes to himself on the sketches, notes such as ‘rubbish’, ‘too heavy’ or ‘move it this way 30 mm’. Eventually he gets to the stage of more formal, orthographic drawings, but still drawing annotated plans, elevations and sections all together, ‘Until at the end of the day the guys at Brabham used to call them “Gordon’s Wonder Plots”, because they used to say “It’s a wonder anybody could see what’s in them”!’\n\n53\n\n54\n\n3\n\nDesigning to please\n\nThis second case study is based on interviews with another\n\noutstanding designer, the industrial designer, Kenneth Grange. As with the previous chapter, the main purpose of making this study is to seek insight into the design thinking of someone who is a very successful, innovative designer.\n\nKenneth Grange is a well-known and very experienced designer of a great variety of products that range in scale from ball-point pens and shavers to taxi cabs and railway engines. His career has spanned over more than fifty years, and many of his designs became (and remain) familiar items in the household or on the street – or on the rail track. These designs include food mixers for Kenwood, razors for Wilkinson Sword, cameras for Kodak, typewriters for Imperial, clothes irons for Morphy Richards, washing machines for Bendix, pens for Parker, lamps for Anglepoise and the front end of the British Rail high-speed train engine. He is one of the RSA’s elite corps of ‘Royal Designers for Industry’, and his designs have won ten UK Design Council Awards and the Duke of Edinburgh’s Prize for Elegant Design. He has won the Gold Medal of the Chartered Society of Designers, and in 2001 he was awarded the Prince Philip Designers’ Prize – an award honouring lifetime achievement.\n\nBackground: The art of technical design\n\nKenneth Grange’s very successful career appears to have started and developed initially by a series of accidents. The son of a policeman, the\n\n56\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nfourteen-year-old Kenneth ‘volunteered’ at school for the opportunity to apply for a scholarship to art school. After four years at Willesden School of Arts and Crafts, London, where ‘all I really learned was draughtsmanship’, and a short job as a scene painter with the BBC’s television department, the principal of the art school recommended Kenneth to ‘go and see a woman he knew who was working in the Institute of Town Planning’. This contact in turn recommended him to some architect friends of hers, who turned out to be the firm of Arcon, a leading progressive architectural firm of that era. Kenneth recalls that ‘I had never heard of architecture, I hadn’t the slightest idea of what this meant, but they gave me a job in what they called their technical publications department’, making presentation drawings for clients.\n\nSoon after, at age nineteen, Kenneth Grange was then subject to two years of conscription into the British Army, where his ‘little portfolio’ of drawings got him allocated not to painting camouflage on tanks as he might have expected but as an illustrator producing drawings for instruction manuals. This work involved taking apart, usually by personal trial and error, various artillery mechanisms and then making drawings to illustrate the parts and their assembly. ‘You had to draw them in such a way, order the drawings in such a way, that it was a re-assembly process that you were explaining.’ This self-instruction in the assembly and re-assembly of military machines became Kenneth’s introduction to technical design, and the beginning of his fascination with the way things work, with the necessities of practicality and function that became underlying principles of his approach to design.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Kenneth returned to his architect colleagues for work. One of the Arcon partners, Jack Howe, encouraged Kenneth to undertake some independent work of his own. These private jobs were mostly ‘week-ends painting a mural or whatever. But somehow I picked up a little job which was doing an exhibition for the then [UK] Atomic Energy Authority’. This little job was so successful that the client called him again some months later, to say ‘We’ve taken space at an exhibition in Geneva, and would you like to design the exhibition stand for us?’ The new job turned out to be too large for Kenneth to be able to cope with on his own, ‘but within a month I’d got three people working for me full-time, and we were working in my flat, we’d taken over the living-room as well as the little office-workshop I’d got, and with every week the job increased. It turned into a big, big\n\nDESIGNING TO PLEASE\n\njob’. And so the Kenneth Grange design consultancy was accidentally up and running.\n\nLooking for improvement\n\nA significant feature of much of Kenneth Grange’s design work is that it often arises from a fundamental reassessment of the purpose, function and use of the product. However, this radical, innovative ability is not necessarily the reason why clients invite him to take on a new job. He says: ‘You are invariably brought in by somebody who has got a very elementary commercial motive in changing the perception of the product. It’s extremely unusual for someone to be brought in to approach it from this usability, this function theme.’ But he feels the need for a ‘secure foundation’ when starting a new project and that foundation is the product functionality: how things work and how they are used.\n\nI am never daunted by the blank sheet of paper because I know I can at least fill in my time by trying to sort out just the functionality, just the handling of it, and by-and-large out of that comes a direction, and then it’s a question of tuning. I think it’s due to what your temperament is, your personality. I think, with my background, and my own knowledge about my weaknesses, I am bound to need to have a secure foundation on which I stand when I am arguing about something, and I am not very comfortable when I find myself required to be the prima donna.\n\nHis practical attitude towards product functionality also extends into his normal, everyday life. ‘As I get older I get less and less tolerant of things that don’t work easily, and so I think I go around looking for trouble!’ As an example, he recounts an experience in a restaurant, specializing in serving mussels:\n\nThe waiter comes along and dumps on the table a big stainless steel bowl [of mussels] with a lid, and this is hot. My companion’s lid had handles on it, and mine didn’t have handles on it. That made me furious, and I alone in that restaurant – probably they have never had anybody else complain about it – but not Grange: he\n\n57",

I can’t resist it, because I find that so much like a real affront!\n\nSewing machine\n\nBeing affronted by the poor usability of a product means that in his own design work Kenneth Grange inevitably puts ease of use at the forefront of his thinking. A clear example of this is provided by his design of a sewing machine for Frister & Rossman, a firm based in Germany producing high-quality, well-engineered machines, who were looking for new designs to update their product range. In this case, Kenneth’s attitude led him into trying out the existing sewing machine and looking for ways in which to improve it from the user’s point of view. From those insights he was able to generate a completely new version of a standard product. His resulting design incorporated the existing machinery but repackaged it in novel ways that made the machine easier to use and gave it a new and distinctive form and style (Figure 3.1).\n\nThe origins of the new design features lay in Kenneth’s functional, practical approach and on his personal experience. His starting point was his own use of the sewing machine: ‘I chose to use it, actually making things with a sewing machine, so I did fairly quickly come to understand just fundamental strengths and weaknesses.’ He found what he regarded as a ‘contradiction’ in the conventional design. The sewing machine mechanism is conventionally located centrally over its base platform, whereas the user needs more surface space on their side in front of the needle, rather than behind it. He explained that, ‘In front of the needle, the deeper the table on which you can actually assemble and lay and just get the tension of the fabrics right, the better. Once the work is behind the needle you can do nothing about it, it’s sewn, therefore you don’t need any more space for the fabric.’ Kenneth therefore simply moved the sewing machine mechanism rearwards on its base, creating an off-centre layout with more base-table space in front of the needle than behind it. To him, this appeared a virtually self- evident improvement to make: ‘This is such a straightforward thing to do, but the reason it had not been done before was because the sewing machine had been designed as a very straightforward, basic piece of engineering which needed stability. Therefore the mechanism\n\nDESIGNING TO PLEASE\n\nFIGURE 3.1 The Frister & Rossman sewing machine designed by Kenneth Grange. Courtesy of Kenneth Grange.\n\nwas from the very beginning put centrally upon the base and nobody had thought about challenging the space beyond and the space in front of the needle.’ Once this challenge had been met, and the benefit of an off-centre layout perceived, then ‘the rest of the shape follows, the rest of the shape just absolutely falls into place from that’.\n\nAnother radical change in this particular sewing machine design was also a result of a simple, fundamental assessment of how the machine is used. Kenneth gave the base of the machine rounded lower edges, which might look like a mere ‘styling’ feature, but in fact also arose from function.\n\nThere was something that they told me, which is that a frequent problem with sewing machines, particularly when you are sewing a new fabric, is that a lot of lint comes off the fabric, loose fibres and so on. This gets down into the bobbin and at worst stops the machine, at best will get itself sewn back into the thing, so you haven’t got an absolutely clean stitch, which affects the tension, the thread, etc. And they said, this is a problem, and their way of dealing with it was to make sure you could open the front and get the bobbin out.\n\n59\n\n60\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nThis was achieved by the user tilting the machine away from them into a rather unstable position that only allowed restricted access to the shuttle mechanism in the underside of the base.\n\nTo Kenneth Grange, this was simply inadequate. ‘I thought, that doesn’t seem to me to be very clever, why don’t we make sure we can open the thing and really get at it? So I tilted the thing sideways, I rolled the whole thing back so it stood up and was very firm, and you could get the whole of the guts apart and get at the lint and so on, and that in itself generated a shape because then the back edge of the machine naturally had a roll to it.’ The rounded edge made it easier for the user to tilt the machine, it rested more stable and secure, and the underside was accessible for cleaning and oiling the lower mechanisms. A rounded top front edge was also provided to the base plate, to allow the fabric to slide over it more easily, and various other features were added, such as small drawers for holding accessories. Kenneth’s sketches, illustrating his approach, are shown in Figure 3.2. The sewing machine design demonstrates how Kenneth Grange approaches design from a functional viewpoint. The innovative ‘style’ and features of the new machine were generated from considering and responding to the normal patterns of its use. He says, ‘I think it’s a question of what your attitude is towards anything, any working thing. My attitude is to want it to be a pleasure to operate. I’m a great believer in pleasure in products.’ But it is not only the product’s user he seeks to please, it’s also important to please the client who commissioned it: it’s about ‘wanting to please the consumer and the client’.\n\nAnother aspect of this approach is that he considers the whole pattern of use, as exemplified by considering the requirements for periodically cleaning the machine, and by considering how the user prepares and introduces the fabric into the stitching mechanism, thus requiring more make-up space in front of the needle than behind it. It is a fundamental part of his interest in how things work: ‘Those are the things that intrigue me, recognising that there is a difference between what happens after a particular process and what happens before it, and so on, and preparing yourself for those two stages.’\n\nThe case of redesigning the sewing machine is an example of Kenneth Grange’s attitude of frustration with poor design, as evidenced in his account of the handle-less mussels pot. Like most designers, he has an attitude of discontent towards many existing products: they can always be improved. He says, ‘The designer should be inquisitive\n\nDESIGNING TO PLEASE\n\nFIGURE 3.2 Kenneth Grange’s sketches summarizing some of the principles underlying his design of the sewing machine. Courtesy of Kenneth Grange.\n\nand incurably unsatisfied, because the majority of things around us do not work as well as they should.’ This designerly form of constructive discontent arises from having a critical attitude of looking at products to spot weaknesses in their designs, and not just criticizing them but finding ways of improving them through constructive design thinking.\n\nCase note: Constructive thinking\n\nKenneth Grange’s designerly attitude of constructive\n\ndiscontent derives from noticing that many products are poorly designed: the designer has an appreciation that things could be designed better. This constructive thinking is often triggered by observing how things are actually used by people and noticing the difficulties, large or small, that they experience but perhaps take for granted.\n\n61\n\n62\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nIndustrial designer Sam Farber noticed that, because of the arthritis in her hands, his wife was experiencing difficulty and discomfort whilst using a vegetable peeler. Conventional vegetable peelers were ugly as well as difficult and uncomfortable to use. Sam might have taken over the peeling himself but, as a designer, he realized there was a need to develop new kitchen utensils for the many people who had difficulty handling conventional kitchen utensils, and that they could be more effective and aesthetically pleasing. Sam’s idea was for a new peeler that would be comfortable and secure to grip and manipulate when both dry and wet, attractive and moreover an inclusive design usable by a broad range of users.\n\nSam worked on this concept with the Smart Design consultancy. They developed a design for the peeler based on an oval handle form with soft, flexible fins carved into it to provide the required improved grip for finger and thumb (Figure 3.3). They used a neoprene material that is squeezable and has a comfortable, soft feel with a slight friction to help the grip. The design for the vegetable peeler was the start of a whole new range of kitchen products produced by OXO, a company that Farber started. The products have won awards for usability, appearance and innovative use of materials. Sam has been quoted: ‘It’s hard to think of a vegetable peeler as a radical innovation. But I guess it was!’\n\nFIGURE 3.3 (a) The OXO GoodGrips vegetable peeler; (b) typical pre-OXO peelers. Courtesy of OXO. Photographs by Nigel Cross.\n\nSource: Jonathan Cagan and Craig Vogel: Creating Breakthrough Products.\n\nDESIGNING TO PLEASE\n\nGoing beyond the brief\n\nKenneth Grange was initially very unsure about presenting his sewing machine design proposal to his clients. These were actually the directors of the company that owned Frister & Rossman, the Maruzen company, based in Osaka, Japan. After being carefully briefed by them in Osaka, he returned to England to start the design work and actually developed two different designs. One was the radical new design and the other was more conservative – ‘It created a new form, but followed the brief precisely and did not alter the basic layout of the mechanics.’ Kenneth returned to Osaka with models of both designs.\n\nThe night before I was due to present my proposal, I looked long and hard at the two versions. I was afraid of looking foolish should some blindingly obvious reason be revealed for not deviating from the original brief. Only when I left my room the following morning did I decide to opt for excitement and take them the non-briefed model. In the event, they were very impressed.\n\nGoing well beyond the requirements of the original brief was also a major feature of one of Kenneth Grange’s most prestigious and long- lasting designs, the front bodywork of the high-speed train introduced into passenger service by British Rail in the 1970s, and still in use. It was perhaps surprising for an industrial designer, usually working on much smaller machines and devices, to find himself involved in the design of such a major engineering work, but again it illustrates Kenneth’s functional approach, eagerness to make improvements and to do what seems necessary, rather than just what is asked for.\n\nKenneth recalls that ‘They didn’t call me up and say, We’d like you to design a locomotive’. It began much more modestly, as a result of some smaller jobs that he had undertaken for the railway company, such as redesigning their timetables.\n\nI had done a number of jobs for the railways, all quite modest jobs, but one or two of them quite important; like I was responsible for changing the basic format of timetabling. When I was asked to redesign a timetable for them, it was one of those printed sheets\n\n63\n\n64\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nthat you got, organised from purely the point of view of the driver, which is the way the railways grew up. They were actually drivers’ schedules; they didn’t start by telling you where the train was going, they started by telling you what time the trains went out, and which track, the departure track. Further down was where the thing was going, if you took the time to read it all; it was a list of where the stops were, which is not the way to organise a timetable. The person rushing in to the station, the only thing he knows is where he is going, you want to be able to look up your destination and then see the time of the train, but it was exactly the other way around.\n\nSo Kenneth redesigned the timetable simply to improve it, so that ‘Where you are going comes first, and after that comes the time the train leaves’, and that is how all railway timetables are now organized.\n\nLocomotive\n\nThe High Speed Train (HST) was a project developed within British Rail as a kind of internal company rival to the much-vaunted Advanced Passenger Train (APT) being developed during the same period, which used radical new technologies such as tilting carriages to increase running speeds. The APT project eventually failed altogether, whereas the HST, using evolutionary developments of conventional engineering (and some APT innovations), became hugely successful and, in its prototype version, with a Kenneth Grange-designed front end, set a world speed record for diesel locomotive traction of 230 kilometres per hour.\n\nAfter some small jobs for British Rail, such as the timetable redesign, Kenneth Grange was approached by their Head of the Design Department, James Cousins, about ‘a paint job, the painting of the outside of a train’. This train was the new HST.\n\nSo I went in to see him and he had a model there, and it was a model of a very crude bullet-nosed train, and he said to me, This is being produced by the Engineering Department, this is the train they intend to make, but I can’t possibly let them get away with this awful paintwork. It had zig-zags on, and so he said, Please\n\nDESIGNING TO PLEASE\n\ncome back with a proposal for the painting of this train. I went away and I did that but I also thought, I could improve the shape of this.\n\nThe brief, therefore, was for a styling contribution – a paint livery that might improve the appearance of the train. But Kenneth was not satisfied with such a restricted, paint job contribution; he wanted the styling to emerge from the function, and so, without telling his client, he found an aerodynamicist and managed to get use of a wind tunnel test facility at Imperial College, London, and began to make a series of models of the front of the train, gradually developing a better, more efficient, overall shape.\n\nSo bit by bit we developed an evolution of the shape of the train, based upon wind tunnel testing. I then went along to Cousins with this information and I said, Here’s some photos of a shape that’s not your bullet-nose, but it’s a shape that I think is much more elegant – and by the way, here’s the paint job. And he went into a meeting with the Board, and when this thing came up on the agenda he said, Here’s the model and here’s the livery I propose, but we have taken the liberty of doing some preliminary work on the shape; we believe that the shape proposed – nothing to do with the [engineering of the] running gear, with the actual motor, and so on – but we believe the shape actually could be more efficient. And he had the wind tunnel photographs and the Engineering Department had never been near a wind tunnel! I wish I had been in the meeting, I’m sure it was a real landmark meeting, when the Board was persuaded by these photos from the wind tunnel. Then afterwards he came out of the meeting and came back and said, Well, we have a job to do! But the rest was then relatively easy.\n\nA successful prototype was developed to Kenneth’s design, but the story did not end there.\n\nI had kept strictly within the technical terms of the brief. This dictated a window made of exceptionally strong flat glass, which severely limited its size, and a single driver’s seat positioned centrally. But instead of production going ahead with my design, a\n\n65",

This had a profound effect on the design, since our aerodynamics, vindicated by the speed record, relied on a smooth flow of air to left and right of the front window.\n\nThere was a number of inter-related problems raised by the necessity of providing for two, side-by-side operators at the front of the cab, instead of the one central operator. The central, relatively small window in the prototype would have to be replaced by two windows with a central bar, and the extra window width inevitably flattened the front profile, thus reducing the aerodynamic efficiency. Even when the glassmakers found that a larger, single sheet of the toughened glass could be produced, the aerodynamic problem was still there.\n\nOne way of regaining the aerodynamic efficiency appeared to be to elongate and lower the rake of the cab front, so as to direct more air up and over the top rather than around the sides. But this option was denied by the technical requirement of providing the locomotive’s buffers at the front, which were located in a fixed position relative to the wheel bogies and could not be fully enclosed. Train buffers are necessary not, as is often thought, to cushion the train’s stop at the end of the track but to assist the locomotive to shunt carriages around in the assembling of complete trains.\n\nKenneth was unhappy about losing the aerodynamic efficiency\n\nand pursued the matter with the railways’ chief engineer.\n\nCredit is due to the chief engineer, because I wasn’t welcomed by these guys, but to this man’s everlasting credit I was sitting in a meeting with him, going over this fact that this new design was not as efficient as the one that they originally bought, and which had already set a world record. But there is no way you can have the geometry and have the wide window and get the same effect, and we were backwards and forwards over this. I suppose I knew that if we didn’t have buffers I’d get a different shape, so I said to him, Tell me again, tell me about buffers, how they work; thinking there might be some way I could sleek them in somehow or other. But you see, you’ve got this great plate and you’ve got probably fifteen inches of movement on the springs because of the shunting, and\n\nDESIGNING TO PLEASE\n\nall that’s got to be on its own stalk, you can’t have that inside a housing, really it’s got to be outside of the housing. And he said, Well, it is true that with this vehicle, which we’ve never, ever made before, we’ve never, ever made a train where the coaches are always attached, with this, of course, they’ll always stay coupled. And he said, So if it’s always coupled, it can’t be used for shunting, and therefore the only thing we need is a hard link. And so he said, So really we don’t need the buffers. To his credit he was prepared to say, We’ve overlooked it. They’d never, ever made a complete train like that before; they made locomotives, and they made carriages.\n\nThe HST was to be a fixed formation of passenger carriages between powercars at each end, which would not require shunting to assemble and disassemble trains. The development of the HST nose design is illustrated in Figure 3.4.\n\nKenneth’s perseverance had led to the vital breakthrough. The buffers on this locomotive for a new, permanently coupled train could be dispensed with. The aerodynamic efficiency could be retained by diverting the airflow from around the sides to over the top of a sleeker, more stylish, cab front. British Rail had a completely new, modern image, arising from its original request for ‘a paint job’. The HST train is still in service, and on its fortieth anniversary in 2016 one of the locomotives was named the ‘Sir Kenneth Grange’ in honour of its (recently knighted) designer (Figure 3.5).\n\nThe acceptance of the convention of having buffers on a locomotive is an example of fixation – a kind of unconscious, blinkered thinking in\n\nFIGURE 3.4 Development of the nose of the High Speed Train to improve aerodynamics: (a) rounded nose with buffers; (b) raked nose without buffers.

In both the sewing machine and the high-speed train, Kenneth Grange was able to create innovative designs by questioning some conventional aspects of existing designs that were taken for granted as being essential. As Gordon Murray said, a creative designer has to keep their previous experience, and their knowledge of existing designs, at the back of their mind, not the front.\n\nCase note: Fixation\n\nBrian Meek was designing a new version of an existing,\n\nsuccessful fret saw for the Knew Concepts company. This kind of saw is used for precise, intricate cutting of wood and metal, for example in marquetry or jewellery, and its frame needs to be light and also stiff both longitudinally (along the blade) and in torsion (around the blade). The existing saw had a frame of titanium with holes cut into it to reduce weight (Figure 3.6.a). Because of rapidly rising material costs, Brian was looking for a new design that would use less material. A way to do that would be to assemble the saw from smaller, separate pieces, in place of the single-piece frame\n\nDESIGNING TO PLEASE\n\ncut from a large sheet of material. Brian began experimenting with making the frame from three separate pieces (two legs and the top) which could be cut with less waste from a smaller sheet of material. The problem then was how to join the pieces together into a form that was sufficiently stiff. A prototype was made with a two- piece top riveted to a pair of legs (Figure 3.6.b). Brian commented: ‘We tried for about six months to figure out some way to puzzle- piece a basically 2-D frame together, with no luck. Most of those designs were rigid in tension, but had no torsional rigidity at all.’\n\nThen, in the midst of some tinkering, Brian almost accidentally came upon a three-dimensional truss structure. ‘I took home some test parts that I’d been fiddling with one night. I got completely sick of looking at them, and bent them outwards to form the basis of the truss that you now see [on the final product]. I zig-zagged a bit of strip across the top as bracing, just to see what would happen . . . Bingo! It didn’t deflect at all, and a design was born’ (Figure 3.6.c). The final design, with a more refined top part, was named the ‘birdcage saw’ (Figure 3.6.d).\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Evolution of the fret saw frame: (a) the prior one-piece frame; (b) a multi-piece frame; (c) the top frame parts spread into a 3-D truss; (d) the final ‘birdcage’ design.

He even mounted a whole exhibition of ‘Those that got away’ – more than forty design proposals and prototypes that were rejected by his clients or failed to go into manufacture, including a postmodern-styled toaster and a wine bottle shaped deliberately to provide a ‘glug’ sound as it poured. One of them was a design for the Channel Tunnel Eurostar train, running between Britain and continental Europe. Kenneth was one of four designers invited to submit proposals, and he felt confident of winning the competition, given his previous experience with the HST. He worked on two designs, one with a ‘bubble’ windscreen for the driver, and one much closer to the HST shape. He says that, ‘Because I thought the train was a sort of natural son of the HST, I abandoned the bubble idea’. But the competition was won by someone who produced a design based around just such a ‘bubble’ windscreen. Kenneth suspects that his design may have been rejected because it looked somewhat similar to his design of the earlier British HST train. ‘The real blunder for me was to have even thought of a reference to the HST. Clearly the French and the Belgian partners most certainly would not have wanted a son of the British national train on “their” railways!’\n\nAnother railway-related design failure for Kenneth was the ‘net chair’ he designed for British Rail. The goal was to produce a very\n\nDESIGNING TO PLEASE\n\nlightweight seat that would make a significant contribution to reducing the overall weight of a railway carriage, thereby reducing both capital and running costs. Kenneth found a net fabric used to make astronaut couches in spacecraft. Through a lot of experimentation with frames for holding this fabric, he produced a highly ergonomic, comfortable and very lightweight seat in which the stretched net fabric was the primary support for the user. But unfortunately the seat fabric was realized to be highly vulnerable to vandalism. Some train passengers were not the sort of people that Kenneth was seeking to please with his elegant design. ‘We had reckoned without the spite of the travelling yobbo who, with one quick slash of a knife, could destroy the seat.’ This was a lesson about realizing the whole wide range of people who are likely to be the ‘users’ of a new design.\n\nDesign process and working methods\n\nThe examples of the Frister & Rossman sewing machine and the British Rail High Speed Train illustrate Kenneth Grange’s approach to design, which seems predominantly to be based on generating style and form from function and use. This seems to be the natural way for him to work, even though his clients sometimes do not realize this, and approach him as a ‘stylist’. ‘They think’, he says,\n\nWe need a new design, we need a new style. They’re sharp enough to realise the style is outdated or whatever, and they assume because of what they have seen that it’s a purely artistic thing, it’s a fashion thing only to do with style. I can’t get to a solution from that beginning, so I start entirely from the point of view of, can I make the use of the thing better. Eventually, by some extraordinary piece of good fortune, I wind up with a style that they think is terrific and how it got there they are not interested. It does become interesting when we then start to develop it because I find I’m defending bits of the mechanical process and they don’t want me to, particularly the engineers don’t want me to!\n\nHe says he always has a concern with ‘the nitty-gritty’ of products and their use, including not only their primary function but also\n\n71\n\n72\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nsecondary aspects such as their cleaning. And yet he rejects what he sometimes sees in others as ‘a highly moral stance where function is all’. There has been a temptation, he says, for some designers ‘to scorn the elements of style, fashion and pleasure. That, in my view, is the road to righteous boredom’. His view is that ‘Design should solve a problem, work well, last, and, of course, look good’.\n\nIn addition to this personal commitment, however, he frequently refers to the ‘happy accidents’ that seem to have dominated his career.\n\nI keep saying accident, but it is – I happen to be on the scene when people need a particular skill, and I am of the good fortune to be on the doorstep, passing the front door when that particular skill is needed. An example of this casualness, as I call it, is in both the train and in the design I did for the Chef [the Kenwood Chef food mixer – one of Kenneth’s earliest and most well-known designs, Figure 3.7], which eventually led me to 35 years of working with Kenwood. I got the job of designing the Chef because I said I’d do it in three days, and my fee was probably the lowest of the three people they were talking to. And the casualness, by which the thing was accepted, and then goes into production, and my whole life opens up, is that with only three days in which to do it, and the only method I knew, because I’d never had any training as a designer, although a good draughtsman I’d never had any of the skilful training about presentation drawing, so I wasn’t good at flashy drawings and things and I did everything with model making, every single thing I did with model making because I could do it, personally do it. But I didn’t have enough time, I only had time enough to make half a model, just could not make a whole model, so I made a half and I took a mirror with me [to place alongside to give the effect of seeing the symmetrical whole]. Now, it wasn’t artifice on my part, at least it wasn’t a trick, it was just a practical way of showing them a whole thing with half the effort. Kenneth Wood [the company owner] loved it, and I think he loved it because he thought it was salesmanship. For me, it was a pure bit of good luck.\n\nDESIGNING TO PLEASE\n\nFIGURE 3.7 The Kenwood Chef kitchen machine was one of Kenneth Grange’s earliest and most successful designs.

Although their examples stem from very different domains of design – Formula One, city car, sewing machine, locomotive – the two designers can be seen to have similarities in their approaches. Some of these similarities seem to stem from their backgrounds and personalities, and they obviously share personal, highly motivated attitudes towards their work and the achievement of success. I will compare their approaches with those of other successful designers and offer an overview of the strategic thinking practices that appear to be common to these designers. I will also introduce some other studies that focus on the nature of creative thinking in design.\n\nMotivation and attitude\n\nGordon Murray thinks that innovative design, certainly in motor racing, starts with ‘a certain type of person’, like himself, who has a strong desire to beat the opposition: ‘All you want to do is go back next time and blow them all into the weeds.’ Not all racing car designers are like that, he agrees, but he has always had that strong competitive urge. The strength of his personal motivation cannot be doubted; it would have been essential to carry him through so many innovations, through failures as well as successes, in such a highly\n\n76\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\npressured environment. He has also had a strong personal interest and practical involvement in motor racing and car design throughout his life, including designing, building and racing his own sports car as a young man. The novel three-seat driver/passengers layout of the McLaren F1, used again in the city car, in which the driver is central and two passengers are side by side slightly behind the driver, is something that appeared in his design sketchbooks as a young man, and he says that other ideas are still there in his various sketchbooks waiting for an opportunity to be realized.\n\nKenneth Grange’s approach to design also seems to be rooted in his early experiences of ‘learning by doing’ – of learning to take apart and re-assemble artillery mechanisms so that he could make the drawings that would explain to someone else how to do it. Another relevant aspect of his time in the Army, he believes, was that it helped develop his physical health and strength, which he regards as a key to the hard work and long hours he later put into building and running his design practice. This physical aptitude is part of the strength of leadership, he believes:\n\nI think a large part of the ability of any team to achieve anything is a mixture of resources – obviously intellectual resource is a very important part, but then there are resources which are simply to do with whether you can stay awake, and stay awake at a keen, high, top level of concentration. So I think inevitably there’s a question of teams following the physical and behavioural examples of the leader.\n\nKenneth also has strong personal motivation and what he calls an ‘I can do it’ attitude: ‘I think there’s a bit of me that is a commercial animal I suppose, a bit of me that’s certainly an “I can do it” man, under any circumstances. I always say yes, and of course it gets me into trouble!’ This personal commitment also helps in the leadership of his design teams, he believes. ‘I think that’s what builds the team; they know back at the ranch that this man Grange is out there saying, “Yes we can do it tomorrow”!’\n\nAs chief designer, it seems necessary to have a lot of self-confidence to carry through new ideas in a highly pressured environment. It involves taking risk and shouldering a lot of responsibility. Gordon\n\nHOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\nMurray finds that this personal responsibility naturally brings intense psychological pressure: ‘There are patches of loneliness really, when you sit there and think, I’m committing all next year’s budget, there are all the mechanics relying on me, all the team, all the sponsors, all the drivers, friends, family – I mean, the car’s got to go well, and I’m committed to this loony idea, you know?’ Even he admits to feeling sometimes very nervous about the risks he was taking: ‘Occasionally you wake up in the night and think, phew, maybe I’ll do a normal car!’ But for him, that risk-taking is the difference between the innovative and non-innovative designer. The speed and pressure and commitment of racing car design are such that adrenalin and an almost physical exhilaration kept him going: ‘It’s like surfing on top of a wave, and you know you can’t get off.’ It’s clear that he also carried this attitude through into designing the city car, self-imposing the pressure to produce a radical new concept of personal transport.\n\nIn explaining his approach to innovative design, Gordon Murray stresses the need constantly to work from ‘first principles’. In Formula One racing, he was often surprised to find that other teams were not taking such a basic approach and that they would frequently merely copy the successful innovations of someone else. Working from first principles and working in a highly organized way seem to come naturally to him, but his personal design process is much less structured than the results might suggest. Although he can tightly organize his team and run a complex racing organization, his personal ways of designing are relatively unstructured, based on annotated, thumb-nail sketches. ‘I don’t sit down and say, OK, now I’ve had the idea, let’s see, this is a solution, these are the different ways to go, if I do this, and do that; I do lots of scribbles just to save it, before I forget.’\n\nFor Kenneth Grange, his innovative design work often stems from going beyond the original brief, and that experience helped form his sceptical attitude towards developing and following a tight initial specification. The designer’s job, he says, is ‘to produce the unexpected’. And that does not happen by trying to ‘get the brief right, go through the process in an orderly fashion, check that you have done what you have been told to do’. Instead, ‘It’s the little bits of inspiration, the little sort of byways and the unlikely analogies and things that eventually produce what you recognise as being the right\n\n77\n\n78\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nthing to do’. He suggests that ‘No brief of itself ever produced an unexpected market leader. Success lies in finding the chinks in the specifications and reaching through to the concealed plums.’\n\nIt is as though his ability is primarily perceptual, a way of seeing; not something that he has to work and worry at until he gets an idea, and not something that emerges in the process of designing so much as the process of initial problem formulation. He agrees with this interpretation: ‘You do have to ferret around, which is like an intellectual bit of it, to see, to find that which is then suddenly obvious to you, and I think that has happened very often. Sometimes you almost have to fabricate the problem.’ He reinterprets, or brings a fresh perception to the design problem so as to prompt a new concept, and the rest is working this through; the perceptive insight gives ‘a direction, and then it’s a question of tuning’.\n\nTheir adoption of first principles is one way that helps these designers repel the enemy of creative thinking – fixation on standard solutions or conventional ways of doing things. They maintain a constructive discontent with the way things are and keep the experience of standard practices at the back of their minds, not the front.\n\nOther outstanding designers\n\nThese two case studies also reinforce and resonate with many of the observations that have been made in other studies of successful, innovative designers and extend even further across the range of fields of design in which they practice.\n\nIn Chapter 1, I drew upon the interviews that Bryan Lawson conducted with some highly successful, creative architects. He drew attention to similarities in the working methods of the architects he studied, which also have similarities with the engineering designer Gordon Murray and the industrial designer Kenneth Grange. One such is the need to maintain periods of intense activity but interspersed with periods, usually away from the normal work environment, of more reflective contemplation. Lawson’s architects also are characterized by a dedicated sense of purpose, which they share with small, highly motivated teams of co-workers.\n\nHOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\nOne thing that emerges strongly from Lawson’s studies that resonates with the study of Gordon Murray is the architects’ use of drawing as a design aid. Lawson observed that, ‘Frequently, drawings are overlaid and mixed together. Two-dimensional plans or sections can be seen with sketches and more diagrammatic marks all on the same piece of paper in what appears a confusing jumble’. These sound very much like Gordon Murray’s ‘Wonder Plots’. The architects also use their drawings as a means of ‘thinking aloud’, or ‘talking to themselves’, as Gordon put it. For example, as the architect Richard MacCormac said, ‘I use drawing as a process of criticism and discovery’, which sounds very similar to Gordon’s approach. The common elements in these similar approaches are the use of drawing as a means not only of externalizing cognitive images but also of actively ‘thinking by drawing’ and of responding, layer after layer and view after view, to the design as it emerges in the drawings. Another study of an innovative designer, by Linda Candy and Ernest Edmonds, is particularly relevant because, like the study of Gordon Murray, it was also based upon the design of race-winning competition vehicles. Candy and Edmonds studied the design process of the racing-bicycle designer, Mike Burrows. His innovative, carbon-fibre, single-piece ‘monocoque’ frame design of 1985 was at first banned by the cycle racing authorities as illegal, but later became the basis of the LotusSport Olympic pursuit bicycle on which Chris Boardman won the 4,000 metres individual pursuit race in world record time at the 1992 Olympic Games (Figure 4.1). Interestingly, as well as working outside or around the regulations, there are many features of Mike Burrows’s design approach that are similar to that of Gordon Murray.\n\nLike Gordon Murray, Mike Burrows is an enthusiast for his sport and has participated as a racing cyclist. They both therefore have a very high personal motivation that drives their work, and both are steeped in the knowledge and expertise of their domains. They both constantly keep abreast of progress and current developments in their own and related fields, simply out of personal commitment, and this can often lead to insights and the transfer of technology from one field to another. A significant difference in working methods, however, is Mike Burrows’s limited use of sketching as a design medium; he prefers to move quickly to immediate physical realizations of ideas in models and mock- ups. This is rather more like Kenneth Grange’s approach of building\n\n79\n\n80\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 4.1 The Lotus Type 108 (LotusSport Olympic pursuit) bicycle used a carbonfibre monocoque frame developed from a design by Mike Burrows.

Nevertheless, his approach to arriving at the ‘monocoque’ cycle design reflects Gordon Murray’s approach of concentrating on a major objective and designing from first principles. In Mike Burrows’s case it was a concentration on pursuing the dominant goal of going faster, which meant minimizing aerodynamic drag. He said, ‘You only knew what the goal was – how fast can you go. You knew you solved that by making it more streamlined. To be very fast, you have to be aerodynamic.’ Single-minded concentration on that goal made Burrows prepared to completely re-conceptualize the conventional bicycle frame. Candy and Edmonds described the resulting design as ‘an integrated holistic design in which all the individual components contributed to the main goal of achieving maximum aerodynamic efficiency’. They suggested that ‘Taking a higher level view of the problem space proved to be a critical change that enabled him to step outside the existing constraints and dare to be radically different’.\n\nRobin Roy interviewed the industrial designer James Dyson, who reported that he almost never solved problems by getting ‘brainwaves in the bath’, but more often when doing some practical work, ‘welding\n\nHOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\nor hammering something in the workshop’. However, this practical work may in itself be a way of letting the mind relax. Two of James Dyson’s most well-known design innovations, the Ballbarrow wheelbarrow, which has a large, ball-shaped wheel to improve handling, and the Cyclone bag-less vacuum cleaner (one model of which is shown in Chapter 2, Figure 2.7), which collects dust in a container by means of a centrifugal cyclone effect. Both of these innovations came from practical experience and from drawing on technology transfer from other fields. The Ballbarrow drew from his experience with balloon tyres on amphibious vehicles, and the Cyclone drew from his installation of an industrial extract cyclone to remove fine powder from the air of the factory where the Ballbarrow was being produced. Roy suggested that, for James Dyson, creative design and innovation ‘is a matter of having good ideas based on experience and careful observation of the real world, followed by hard work involving practical skills, technical expertise and design ability to convert that idea into a marketable product’.\n\nA broader study of several highly innovative engineers was made by Michael Maccoby, based on interviews with eight such people, nominated by their peers. Maccoby identified the life- long commitment of the innovators he studied, extending back to examples of interests stemming from their childhood or youth; the fact that innovators are not put off by failure, but expect to learn from failure; and that they have ‘the courage to innovate’. He also pointed to several examples amongst these innovators of their experience of solutions arising from sudden illumination of problems that they had been worrying about. For example, the engineer-inventor Jacob Rabinow reported that ‘flashes of inspiration come to him while shaving, driving, or partaking in other activities. Solutions are usually sudden’. Not all the innovators reported examples of sudden illumination, and for some, solutions only come from continuous hard work, but it is clear that sudden illumination (within a well-prepared mind) is a frequent element in creative design thinking.\n\nCommon features\n\nThere appear to be sufficient striking similarities between these various studies of creative designers and other innovators for us\n\n81\n\n82\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nto be able to draw some conclusions about common features of a successful approach to innovative design. We see in particular the immensely strong commitment of the innovative designer to their chosen field of endeavour, based on a personal motivation that has been within them since youth. Added to this is a personal courage to take risks, even in the face of huge consequences for failure. The innovative designer is prepared to fail (occasionally) but is not afraid of failure and of course seeks fanatically to avoid failure.\n\nBeyond these personality characteristics, there are some useful observations to be made about the methods and approaches adopted by successful, innovative designers and which might perhaps to some extent be transferable to others. A key aspect of the approach lies in defining or framing the problem to be solved, which is not always the same as ‘the problem as given’. The goal is set at a high level, with clear objectives and in direct terms which might even seem to be simplistic. It is this simple clarity which might make other people conclude that the goal is simply impossible. There is a holistic, systems view of the problem encapsulated in the goal. A clear concept of how to reach this goal is devised, sometimes by means of a sudden insight which comes when relaxing after deep immersion in the problem, and the solution details then cascade from the concept. Intense work is needed to develop, evaluate and refine the solution details; creativity is still ‘1% inspiration and 99% perspiration’. The clear, generative concept is not simply ‘found’ in the problem as given, but largely created by the designer; it is a matter not of recognizing a pre-existing pattern in the data but of creating a pattern that re-formulates the problem and suggests directions towards a solution.\n\nThis approach seems to require, or is synergistic with, a particular style of working. Some aspects of this style arise from the innovative designer’s personality characteristics – for instance, their personal motivation means that they are steeped in their chosen domain, and they are prepared when necessary to work obsessively at their chosen problem and solution. The working style is based on periods of intense activity, coupled with other periods of more relaxed, reflective contemplation. This working style may not be a reflection of a particular personality trait but a necessary aspect of creative work, which requires alternating intense effort with relaxation. The",

      "content": "HOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\ninnovative designer also likes, perhaps needs, to work with a small team of committed co-workers who share the same passions and dedication.\n\nThe innovative designer seems to be too involved with the urgent necessity of designing to want, or to need, to use formal creativity or other design techniques.\n\nTheir design approach is more strategic than tactical. An important feature of their strategy is parallel working – keeping design activity going at many levels simultaneously. The best cognitive aid for supporting and maintaining parallel design thinking seems to be drawing. Drawing with conventional tools of paper and pencil gives the flexibility to shift levels of detail instantaneously; allows partial, different views at different levels of detail to be developed side by side or above and below and overlapping; keeps a record of previous views, ideas and notes that can be accessed relatively quickly and inserted into the current frame of reference; and permits and encourages the simultaneous, non-hierarchical participation of co-workers, using a common representation. The drawing of conjectures, partial solutions or representations also aids the designer’s thinking processes, and provides a form of interactive ‘talk-back’. As well as drawing, innovative designers frequently like to undertake practical work related to the design solution, such as building models or mock-ups, or participating in construction.\n\nStrategic thinking\n\nThree key strategic aspects of design thinking appear to be common across all these studies: (1) taking a broad systems approach to the given problem, rather than accepting narrow problem criteria (system design and going beyond the brief); (2) framing the problem in a distinctive and sometimes rather personal way (creating a focused viewpoint on critical or potentially promising aspects); and (3) designing from first principles (using the framing to identify and employ relevant fundamental knowledge).\n\nFirst, there is the systems approach adopted by innovative designers. From his studies of innovators, Maccoby suggested that ‘The innovator has a systems mind, one that sees things in\n\n83\n\n84\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nterms of how they relate to each other in producing a result, a new gestalt that to some degree changes the world’. This sounds similar to the approaches adopted by Gordon Murray and Kenneth Grange. Maccoby continued with an example which might almost be describing Murray’s approach: ‘For example, one can think about a car in terms of all its parts working together to make it go . . . In contrast, most engineers do not think in systems terms. They are concerned about designing a good piece-part, like a clutch.’ This sounds like Gordon Murray describing how his approach is different from conventional, piece-focused, engineering design. It also sounds similar to the approach adopted by Kenneth Grange, in his re-perceptions of the problem as given, usually from the user’s point of view, and considering the user’s overall task for which the product is being designed. This systems approach is evident, for example, in the way he designed the Frister & Rossman sewing machine so as to facilitate the whole process of sewing and the maintenance of the machine. Gordon Murray’s introduction of pit stops also illustrates how a total systems approach was adopted – a focus not just on the design of the car but on the larger picture of winning the race.\n\nSecond, the designers appear to explore the problem from a particular perspective, in order to formulate or frame the problem in a way that stimulates and pre-structures the emergence of design concepts. In some cases, this perspective is a personal one that they seem to bring to most of their designing; for example, Kenneth Grange has a strong, emotional distaste for what he considers to be ‘contradictions’ in design, where the object is not well-adapted to its user and the patterns of use. As he said, ‘My attitude is to want it to be a pleasure to operate.’ And it was from operating the sewing machine that the new concept of an asymmetrical layout emerged, and the rounded edges, which gave the clients the re-styling that they wanted. In the case of the design of an auto-variable suspension system, Gordon Murray’s problem frame was governed by his focus on ‘How the hell can we get ground effect back?’ in order to achieve his goal of the fastest car, whilst satisfying the constraints set by the regulations. For these designers, therefore, their framing arises from the requirements of the particular design situation, but is strongly influenced by their personal motivations, whether they may be\n\nHOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\naltruistically providing pleasure for the product user, or competitively achieving the fastest car.\n\nThird, these designers either explicitly or implicitly rely upon ‘first principles’ in both the origination of their concepts and the detailed development of those concepts. For example, Gordon Murray stresses the need to ‘keep looking at fundamental physical principles’ for innovative design and in his design to regain ground effect he focused on the physical forces that act on a car at speed. Also we saw in his city car design work that fundamental principles in details such as suspension and in manufacturing were part of his thinking from the very beginning. Kenneth Grange is less explicit about first principles, but it seems clear that he adheres to the modernist design principle of ‘form follows function’; he approaches design problems ‘by trying to sort out just the functionality, just the handling of it, and by-and-large out of that comes a direction’. This approach is evident in the examples of his product designs, which are based very much on the ‘first principles’ of function and usability. It was also evident in his design of the HST, which he based on aerodynamic analysis. In both the big HST and the little sewing machine he questioned the established, underlying, standard engineering ‘requirements’ that had dominated the previous solutions.\n\nFinally, it seems from these examples that innovative design arises especially when there is a conflict to be resolved between the (designer’s) high-level problem goals and the (client’s) criteria for an acceptable solution. Creativity is often stimulated when there is a conflict to resolve, and it may be that these successful designers recognize this and seek the stimulus of conflict. Such conflict is particularly evident in Gordon Murray’s design strategy in Formula One, which was to challenge and, if necessary, somehow to legally circumvent the criteria set by the technical regulations. In Kenneth Grange’s case, the potential conflict is often with the client’s criteria for a product re-styling job, whereas his goal is to provide the product’s user with an enhanced affordance of use from the product. As he said, ‘You are almost invariably brought in by somebody who has got a very elementary commercial motive . . . It’s extremely unusual to be brought in to approach it from this usability, this function theme.’ And yet, of course, the client’s criteria still have to be satisfied.\n\n85\n\n86\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 4.2 A model of the design strategy followed by creative designers.\n\nThese similarities in design thinking are illustrated in Figure 4.2. In each case, at the upper, systems level there is a conflict, or potential conflict, between what the designer seeks to achieve as the highest goal and what the client sets as fundamental criteria. At the intermediate level, the designer frames the problem in a personal way and develops a solution concept both to match that frame and to satisfy the criteria. The designer applies that problem frame at the lower level, in order to identify and draw upon first principles of physics, engineering and design that help to bridge between the problem frame and a solution concept.\n\nAt the lowest level is explicit, established knowledge of first principles, which may be domain-specific or more general scientific knowledge. At the intermediate level is where the designer’s strategic knowledge is especially exercised and where that knowledge is more variable, situated in the particular problem and its context, tacit and perhaps personalized and idiosyncratic. At the higher level there is a mix of relatively stable, but usually implicit goals held by the designer, the temporary problem goals and explicit solution criteria specified by the client or other domain authority.\n\nCreative thinking\n\nSo far, we have been looking at how highly successful, innovative designers think and work, especially focusing on how their creative\n\nHOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\ninsights occur. But all designers experience and rely on such moments of creative thinking. Our evidence so far has come from interview studies, but there are also some experimental studies that have focused on the normal episodes of creativity in designing. In one such study, Kees Dorst asked nine experienced, practising industrial designers to each work on the same design problem and to ‘think aloud’ about what they were doing. (We will see more of these kinds of studies in the next two chapters.)\n\nThe problem assignment that Dorst set for the designers was to create a concept for a ‘litter disposal system’ to be provided in a new train in the Netherlands. The client for this project was a plastics products company which already made litter bins, and so that was a major influence on the designers’ approach to the problem brief. The nine concepts that the designers produced were all different but were all essentially variants of a litter bin.\n\nThe designers were asked to complete the assignment within two and a half hours. They were given a design briefing document and they could also access a file of relevant information sheets which included aspects such as interviews with the client, technical information about materials and production techniques and surveys that had been conducted of train users with respect to litter. The designers’ comments and actions as they worked were audio and video recorded for analysis.\n\nIn his analysis, Dorst noticed that all the designers exhibited the same kind of creative thinking insight into the problem and its solution. In the various information sheets that the designers could access, problems to do with the newspapers that people leave in trains occurred in several separate places, for example:\n\nnewspapers make up 40 per cent of the contents of the bins –\n\nthe largest single type of train litter\n\nsometimes the newspapers are left behind on the seats or\n\nluggage racks\n\nthe train cleaners complain about having to collect the\n\nscattered newspapers\n\nthe railway company wants to attain an environmentally\n\nfriendly image, and they are thinking about ways of recycling the waste collected in trains\n\n87\n\n88\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nDorst reported:\n\nAll nine designers found most of these four issues in their exploration of the assignment, amongst many other issues to which they had to attend. These loose bits of information can be combined into the idea that newspapers should be collected separately from other litter. All nine designers had this idea, and all of them reported upon it as an original idea, a key concept in their solution. The designers were very enthusiastic about this idea. It was a real ‘aha!’ event for them.\n\nEach designer seemed to think that this was an original concept and indeed it was original in the sense that it was a different concept from the existing litter bin, and it was also original to each individual designer. All the designers took this idea as one of the key features in their subsequent design process, even though it led to a number of different designs. For instance, the system level on which they incorporated this idea in the end differed amongst designers: it is possible to consider the level of the whole train, a single railway carriage or just a compartment within a carriage as the scope of the design, or simply add a newspaper rack to a litter bin. For most designers, their product solution worked at a very local level (incorporating a specific newspaper container in the litter bin), whilst another designer included a newspaper rack to be placed at the end wall of each passenger compartment, and one designer made the collection of waste to be possible from outside of the train carriage.\n\nProblem framing\n\nThese designers’ identification of newspapers as a particular feature of the design problem, resulting in the design goal of ‘keeping newspapers separate’, is a typical example of problem framing by experienced designers. How did the designers come to their framing of the problem? They all appeared to have a similar strategy. With respect to the ‘keep newspapers separate’ idea, a common recognition emerged of a cluster of related information. The designers checked through the information related to the assignment to build\n\nHOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\nup a general perception of the problem, but also to look for surprises. This process led them to an overview of the project (and of the priorities of the stakeholders) together with a collection of ‘interesting points’ – for instance, the designers were all seen to select and make a small stack of information sheets that interested them or make a list of these interesting items.\n\nAs I discussed in Chapter 1, Donald Schön characterized designing as ‘a reflective conversation with the situation’ which depends very much on acts of problem framing. According to Schön, ‘In order to formulate a design problem to be solved, the designer must frame a problematic design situation: set its boundaries, select particular things and relations for attention, and impose on the situation a coherence that guides subsequent moves.’ Schön suggested that the skilled, reflective practice of designers proceeds through acts of naming, framing, moving and reflecting. In the example of the litter bins, the designers selected features of the problem space to which they chose to attend (naming – ‘interesting’ or ‘surprising’ items of information), formed a specific scoping which they chose as a basis for exploration (framing – a focus on ‘keep newspapers separate’), generated ideas in the solution space (moving – partial solution conjectures), considered the possibilities and implications of those conjectures (reflecting) and proceeded to re-iterate until reaching a definitive design concept.\n\nKees Dorst used Schön’s reflective practice schema of naming- framing-moving-reflecting to analyse the data from his experiments, using the recordings of the designers’ ‘think aloud’ comments. An example of a section of the analysis of one designer is shown in Table 4.1. This thirty-minute section begins just before the designer has the ‘keep newspapers separate’ idea, whilst he is considering the train carriage wall as the location for a bin. He suddenly says, ‘Just had a flash – would it be good to make separate bins?’ Combining separate aspects of the problem together in this way to form a pattern is an example of emergence happening in the problem space. For this designer, and all the others, this emergent pattern became their initial problem frame.\n\nThe designer then refers back to the problem information on the types of litter and other aspects such as client preferences, use by passengers and cleaners, refines the ‘separate bins’ idea and then\n\n89\n\n90\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nTABLE 4.1 Reflective practice analysis of one designer’s activities, based on their ‘think aloud’ comments (naming and framing) and sketching (moving) during the experiment\n\nProblem space\n\nSolution space\n\nNaming\n\nFraming\n\nMoving\n\nCarriage walls construction\n\nSeparate bins for different kinds of litter\n\nTypes of litter\n\nSeparate bins for different kinds of litter, small bins for non- paper litter\n\nExperiments with the position of the bin\n\nBin to protrude into the passenger space as little as possible\n\nOutlines shape and size of current bin\n\nHeight of bin\n\nBin and chair\n\nExperiments with position and integration of the bin\n\nBin and wall\n\nSeparate bins for different kinds of litter, integrated into wall\n\nExperiments with different configurations\n\nOpening lid and emptying bin\n\nExplores possible ways of opening the bin\n\nHOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\nProblem space\n\nSolution space\n\nSeparate bins for different kinds of litter, make the product as shallow as possible\n\nSize of the mouth of the bin\n\nReachability for passengers\n\nSpace between the seats\n\nSeparate bins for newspapers and other litter and the bins in the walls\n\nExplores different configurations of bins for newspapers and litter\n\ngoes on to make sketches of the bin size and possible forms. He continues to transition between the problem and solution spaces, considers the wall and the passenger seat as possible bin locations, makes the final decision in favour of the wall and then continues to the end of the session solely in sketching and finalizing his design concept and its component parts (Figure 4.3).\n\nKees Dorst had all of the nine design proposals produced in this study evaluated by a panel of independent judges and this example was graded the highest. He commented on this designer’s process that it\n\ndoesn’t start with a problem definition, and the designer doesn’t seem to have a structured way toward reaching a solution . . . But if we take the initial idea [separate bins] as what it was – a frame idea that works as a ‘primary generator’ in guiding a possible interpretation of the problem situation – and we follow the twists and turns of the designer closely, it reads as a very coherent story.\n\n91\n\n92\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 4.3 The designer’s sketches for the litter bin.

Courtesy of Kees Dorst/‘Designer 4’.\n\nCo-evolution\n\nIn the example of the litter disposal project all nine designers used their insight of ‘keep the newspapers separate’ to then structure and guide their design concept. It illustrates how an understanding\n\nHOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\nFIGURE 4.4 A diagrammatic representation of the co-evolution of problem and solution.\n\nof the given problem develops towards a framing that suggests a way forward towards potential solution ideas. This interactive process of discovery between problem and solution in designing has been characterized as a process of co-evolution.\n\nIn co-evolution terms, in the ‘keep newspapers separate’ insight, there is the recognition of a pattern of connections between some diverse but related information items that enables the designers to make a partial structuring of the problem space. That gives them a problem frame, and they use that to begin to construct a partial structuring of the solution space – that is a solution could be based around forms of container that keep the newspapers separate from the other litter. As the designer pursues that solution idea they uncover aspects or issues that direct them back into the problem space, which in turn leads to a re-structuring, and so the designer’s understanding of the problem and their conjecturing of a solution co-evolve (Figure 4.4). In this interpretation of design as a co-evolution of both solution and problem, the designer’s attention oscillates between the two, forming partial, related structurings of the problem and solution spaces, linked through framing. Dorst and Cross observed from this study:\n\nThe designers start by exploring the problem space, and find, discover, or recognise a partial structure. That partial structure is then used to provide them also with a partial structuring of the solution space. They consider the implications of the partial structure within the solution space, use it to generate some\n\n93",

They transfer the developed partial structure back into the problem space, and again consider implications and extend the structuring of the problem space. Their goal . . . is to create a matching problem-solution pair.\n\nThe identification of ‘a matching problem-solution pair’ is the creative act of cognition when a designer concludes: this is my understanding of the problem, and this is my matching proposal for its solution.\n\nThe co-evolutionary transfer of perceptions and insights between solution and problem spaces was also recorded by Masaki Suwa and his colleagues in their study of an experienced architect at work. They focused on the emergence of ‘unexpected discoveries’ during the design process – that is, instances when the designer perceived something ‘new’ or ‘interesting’ emerging in a previously drawn element of a solution concept – and noticed that these led to the generation of further issues or requirements within the design problem. They found a strong bi-directional correlation between unexpected discoveries in the developing solution and the elaboration of issues and requirements within the problem. The instances of unexpected discoveries were facilitated by the designer’s sketching: Suwa suggested that ‘drawing sketches, . . . perceiving visuo-spatial features in sketches, and conceiving of design issues or requirements are all dynamically coupled with each other’. The designer’s perception of emergent features in their solution ideas leads to reconsidering their understanding and defining of the problem.\n\nSo designers use solution conjectures as the means of developing their understanding or interpretation of the problem. Since the problem cannot be fully understood in isolation from consideration of its solution, it is natural that solution conjectures should be used as a means of helping to explore and understand the problem formulation. Solution conjectures often prompt the further consideration of problematic issues, and so the problem and solution co-evolve.\n\nStefan Wiltschnig and his colleagues extended the study of co-evolution from laboratory studies of individual designers into real- world team design processes. They studied a team of designers working on a project in medical product design, and found that co-evolution was significantly present in teamwork just as in individual work. They identified many episodes of co-evolution where team\n\nHOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\ndiscussion moved rapidly back and forth between elements within the problem space and solution generation activity, as the team members collaboratively formed acts of problem-solution pairing. These episodes revealed close links between co-evolution and creative processes, and they concluded that ‘the evidence points to co-evolution episodes as being the creative engine of everyday design practice’.\n\nSummary\n\nOutstanding designers have strong motivation and commitment, often with deeply immersed personal backgrounds and extensive experience in their chosen fields. They have an attitude of constructive discontent, paying critical attention to existing designs to see and suggest how they could be improved. Their creative approach extends across all design levels, including detail design as well as broader conceptualization throughout the design process. An element of risk-taking and courage is necessary in innovative designing. Innovative design arises from challenging the given brief, the assumed constraints on what is achievable, and the influence of standard solutions. Focused, persistent work usually contributes more to creative insights than sudden, unexpected illumination. Innovative designers frame the given problem in a challenging way, forming high-level systems goals and drawing on fundamental technical first principles. Creative insights in design can feel highly personal to the individual but may be common across different designers approaching the same problem. The creative design process is one of co-evolution, developing problem and solution together: explorations of possible solutions lead back to reconsidering the problem.\n\nSources\n\nFull citations are given in the References.\n\nLinda Candy and Ernest Edmonds: Creative design of the Lotus\n\nbicycle, Design Studies.\n\n95\n\n96\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nKees Dorst: Describing Design and Frame Innovation.

This experiment technique involves asking designers to think aloud as they tackle a design task. The designers’ statements and actions are recorded for later analysis, in which they are subdivided into short ‘protocols’. The next two case studies are derived from these types of experiments.\n\nThis case study is of the expert, highly skilled and very experienced American engineer Victor Scheinman, who agreed to act as the participant in a protocol study. Victor had been a pioneer in designing modern robotic devices and won several awards from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for his work in the design of mechanical and electro-mechanical machines – an accomplished engineering designer, outstanding in his field. Although Victor came with a wealth of design experience in complex machines, the design task set in the experiment was a much simpler but still novel task for him. The task was to design ‘a carrying/fastening device that would enable you to fasten and carry a backpack on a mountain bicycle’.\n\nThe case study provides a detailed record of one example of Victor Scheinman’s design process, in which his concern with product usability figures prominently. Although the study comes from an experimental and artificial situation, there are some interesting observations that somewhat parallel those from the previous two case studies of expert designers.\n\n98\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nThe experiment\n\nProtocol analysis relies on the verbal accounts given by participants of their own cognitive activities. One of the most direct ways in which we can try to know what is going on inside people’s heads is by asking them to tell us what they are thinking. Of course, this is fraught with difficulties. People do not necessarily know what is going on inside their own heads, let alone have the ability to verbalize it. Also, there may well be side effects of the verbalization, such that it actually changes the participant’s behaviour and their cognitive performance. Or the participant may, quite unintentionally, give irrelevant accounts, reporting parallel but independent thoughts to those that are actually being employed in the task. These disadvantages weigh particularly heavily on the validity of protocol analysis in studying design thinking, where non-verbal processes are a significant feature of the relevant cognitive activities and where the use of sketches and similar externalization of thought processes seem to be fundamental.\n\nNevertheless, people do normally find it relatively straightforward to give a verbal account of what they believe they are thinking or what they were thinking recently. Retrospective verbal accounts (i.e. recalling what one was thinking recently) offer one means of getting at cognitive activity which is frequently used not only in research but also in everyday interchanges, such as ‘What were you thinking when you were doing that?’ Concurrent verbal accounts (i.e. ‘thinking aloud’) offer the researcher the hope that they really do externalize – or allow insight into – at least some of the participants’ cognitive activities. Of all the empirical, observational research methods for the analysis of design activity, protocol analysis is the one that has received the most attention and application. It has become regarded as the most likely method to bring out into the open, at least to some extent, the somewhat mysterious skills of design thinking.\n\nFor this study, Victor Scheinman was invited to participate in a research project into design thinking. He was told that the research would involve him undertaking a short (two-hour) design exercise, within the engineering product design domain. The experiment was conducted in a design project room supplied with table and chair, drawing pad, pens and pencils and whiteboard, and equipped\n\nDESIGNING TO USE\n\nwith video and audio recording facilities. Also in the room were a mountain bicycle and the specific backpack to be used for the design assignment. An experimenter was present in the room, who had a file of various sheets of relevant information and data that Victor could ask for if he wanted to. At the start of the experiment, Victor was given the design brief, to design a device for carrying a backpack on a mountain bicycle, as in Figure 5.1.\n\nDesign in action\n\nIn the following analysis of Victor Scheinman’s design process, quotations are taken from the transcript of his ‘think aloud’ comments, preceded by the timestamp for the quotation. After some preliminary remarks and questions, the substantive experimental session began at timestamp 00:15 minutes.\n\nQuite early in the session Victor began to identify particular features of the problem that would influence his approach to developing a design concept. For example, commenting on the preliminary design that had been developed for the purposes of the experiment (a feasible but deliberately rather poor design, with the backpack mounted vertically on a pannier rack behind the saddle) and which was available in the information store together with a user evaluation report on that design, he surmised that:\n\n(00:22) [The report] probably says the backpack’s too high or something like that, and that bicycle stability’s an issue.\n\nHe was also able to draw on some personal experiences that helped him to formulate some of the implicit requirements for a good design solution:\n\n(00:26) Having used a backpack on a bike in the past and having ridden over many mountains, unfortunately not on a mountain bike but I can imagine that the situation is similar, I learned very early on that you want to keep it as low as possible.\n\n99\n\n100\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nHiAdventure Inc. is a fairly large US firm (some 2,000 employees) making backpacks and other hiking gear. They have been very successful over the last ten years and are well known nationwide for making some of the best external-frame backpacks around. Their best selling backpack, the midrange HiStar, is also sold in Europe. In the last one and a half years, this European activity has suffered some setbacks in the market; in Europe internal- frame backpacks are gaining a larger and larger market share.\n\nAs a response, HiAdventure has hired a marketing firm to look for new trends and opportunities for the European market. On the basis of this marketing report, HiAdventure has decided to develop an accessory for the HiStar:\n\nA special carrying/fastening device that would enable you to fasten and carry the backpack on mountain bikes.\n\nThe device would have to fit on most touring and mountain bikes, and should fold down, or at any rate be stacked away easily. A quick survey has shown that there is nothing like this on the European market.\n\nThis idea is particularly interesting for HiAdventure, because the director, Mr Christiansen, has a long-standing private association with one of the chief product managers at the Batavus bicycle company (one of the larger bicycle manufacturers in northern Europe, based in Holland). Mr Christiansen sees this as a good opportunity to strike up a cooperation and to profit from the European marketing capabilities of Batavus.\n\nThe Batavus product manager, Mr Lemmens, is very enthusiastic about putting a combination-product on the market, a mountain bike and a backpack that can be fastened to it. The idea is to base the combination-product on the Batavus Buster (a midrange mountain bike), and to sell it under the name Batavus HikeStar.\n\nThe design department at Batavus has made a preliminary design for the carrying/fastening device, but both Mr Christiansen and Mr Lemmens are not very content with it. The user's test performed on a prototype also showed some serious shortcomings. That is why they have hired you as a consultant to make a different proposal.\n\nYou are hired by HiAdventure to make a concept design for the device, determining the layout of the product, concentrating on\n\nease of use\n\na sporty, appealing form\n\ndemonstrating the technical feasibility of the design\n\nmaking sure to stay within a reasonable price range\n\nYou are asked to produce annotated sketches explaining your concept design.\n\nFIGURE 5.1 The design brief for the experiment.\n\nHe then continued by calling for advice from others. In the information file held by the experimenter were examples of some commercially available bicycle luggage carriers and racks, including those of the Blackburn company, which Victor asked to see. But it seemed\n\nDESIGNING TO USE\n\nthat Victor would normally also make use of personal contacts. He commented:\n\n(00:33) Alright here’s what I would do at this time if – I would get on the phone, call up some friends. I have a friend who happens to have worked in the bicycle business for many years, and I would probably call him and pick his brain a bit. I happen to know that the Blackburn company is local, so I will call them up.\n\nVictor telephoned the company and said that he was seeking advice about what sort of bicycle luggage carriers he should use for carrying a backpack on a mountain bike. For example, he asked:\n\nI wanted to know what’s the trade off between carrying panniers on the front versus the rear, which is better on a mountain bike?\n\nWhat happens if the centre of gravity is pretty high up above the bike, do you have a stability problem?\n\nWhat happens if you put it in the front, it looks like you could put things high in the front, or is that worse? That’s the worst, OK.\n\nWithin a ten-minute telephone conversation, Victor gained valuable knowledge of existing solutions to the design problem type, advice about the implications of some options (such as front versus rear mounting) and confirmation of some of his own prior knowledge.\n\nVictor also drew upon his own personal experience to make the final decision that the location for the backpack would be over the rear wheel:\n\n(00:51) My first thought is, hey the place to put it is back here; there’s another advantage by the way of having it in the back I can see immediately, and that is it’s off the side in the front, and if you’re on a mountain bike trail and you hit something you’re out of control in the front wheel.\n\n(00:52) With downhill work on mountain bikes, I know you want to keep your weight back rather than forwards.\n\n101",

This is a different situation to that of everyday, smooth-surface, level-grade riding, and it accentuates the need to position the backpack low and to the rear. The view that Victor had of the design task was significantly different from a view that might be formed from considering the bicycle and backpack in a static situation, or without considering the effects on the rider’s ability to control the bicycle with a mounted backpack. Victor’s understanding of the dynamic situation therefore enabled him to formulate a broad view of the design task.\n\nFrom this overview of the total dynamic system of rider + bicycle + backpack, Victor identified stability as a key issue, and framed the problem as ‘how to maintain stability’. Given that a heavy backpack had to be carried over the rear wheel of the bicycle, and given his experience of the ‘wobbling’ that can occur in the riding situation, this problem framing and his prior experience led him to conclude that he must design a rigid carrying device:\n\n(00:59) The biggest thing that I remember in backpack mounting is that it’s got to be rigid, very rigid.\n\nHe then developed this viewpoint into the requirement that the structural members of any carrying device must be stiff:\n\nDESIGNING TO USE\n\n(01:06) Making the carrier stiff enough for holding the backpack, that seems to be a big issue.\n\nFirst principles\n\nSo, at about halfway through the session, Victor had derived a framing of the problem which directed him to design a stiff, rigid carrier, mounted as low as possible over the rear wheel. Having established a need for rigidity, Victor was able to utilize his knowledge of structural engineering principles as he developed a concept design for the carrying device – in particular, knowledge that a triangulated structure is inherently rigid. At this time, Victor began to develop his design concept through a series of drawings, shown in Figures 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4.\n\nWhilst sketching a rear view of the basic position and layout for\n\nthe device (Figure 5.2), Victor commented:\n\n(01:07) One of the problems with a bicycle carrier where the frame is mounted out here and it goes to that, is that you end up with a parallelogram – bad thing, bad thing!\n\nHis knowledge of structural design principles led him to avoid designing a rectangular, parallelogram structure, which was the form that rather naturally seemed to arise from considering the basic shape of the carrier and the location of its supporting structure on the bicycle. Here we can see that Victor, like other designers, is using the act of drawing as ‘a process of criticism and discovery’.\n\nHe expanded on this critical comment, emphasizing his concern\n\nwith stability as a key requirement:\n\n(01:08) If I were to make a frame that looked like this, that would be a very poor design because basically what I’ve got is, I’ve got a parallelogram which has very little lateral stability.\n\nHe then drew a triangular form onto the layout, introducing the structural design principle of triangulation, which offers inherent stiffness:\n\n103\n\n104\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 5.2 Victor Scheinman’s early sketch, in which he identified triangularity as a key structural principle. Courtesy of Victor Scheinman.\n\n(01:09) It would be nice if I could, for instance, run these rods up here to some point and therefore create a triangle, this would give me great stiffness – good idea!\n\nDesigning for clients and users\n\nSoon after, another viewpoint emerged, which arose from considering the client’s needs as well as those of the user and of\n\nDESIGNING TO USE\n\nFIGURE 5.3 Victor’s later sketch, as he develops the concept. Courtesy of Victor Scheinman.\n\na rigid structure (which had dominated Victor’s thinking so far). Like Kenneth Grange, Victor knew that it is important to satisfy the client who has commissioned the project, as well as to please the potential users of a product. In this project, the client for the design task was a manufacturer who wanted to sell the carrying device in conjunction with their already-existing backpack. The device therefore needed to have unique, positive features that differentiated it from other, similar products. During the development of his design concept, Victor kept in mind that he needed the product to have a ‘proprietary feature’. He used the client’s requirement of a unique selling proposition to help guide and reinforce his decision to seek a design based on triangular structures:\n\n(01:10) That is going to be our proprietary feature, a triangular, rigid structure with no bends in it; these rods are then going to be in tension and compression, no bending.\n\n105\n\n106\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 5.4 Victor’s final design sketches for a tubular aluminium structure with folding legs to attach to the bike frame and rising to a triangular point. Courtesy of Victor Scheinman.\n\nThe principle of triangulation subsequently guided Victor’s generation of the basic form and the detailed design features of his carrier. As he drew his design in more detail, he commented:\n\n(01:16) We’re going to have this as a triangular structure here to provide the lateral stability.\n\nDESIGNING TO USE\n\nAs he continued to develop his design, he constantly referred to structural principles, seeking to avoid ‘bad’ configurations and to generate ‘good’ ones, making comments such as:\n\n(01:42) My detail here is going to have to be something like this because my forces along this tube are this way . . . good, this is good; and then this detail is going to be, er, let’s see . . . alright that’s bad, that’s bad . . . that’s bad, so I’m going to need something like that.\n\nAt the same time, as noted earlier, Victor also used the client’s requirement of a unique selling proposition to help guide and to reinforce his decision to seek a design based on triangular structures:\n\n(01:41) I want to make sure that this rod here comes to a point, not stop right there . . . that’s to a point; that’s going to be my feature.\n\nHere we see another example of co-evolution in designing, as Victor begins to develop some solution ideas and then moves back into the problem space to relate those to his understanding of the client’s requirements. In his comments, Victor demonstrated that he regarded the pronounced triangular form at the rear of the carrier as something to be retained as a feature that would help give the product an attractive and distinctive appearance. His design for the carrying device was therefore based on an integrated concept in which user requirements are addressed through the problem frame of stability, leading to the use of triangularity as the guiding first principle, which he then also used to address the client’s goal of having a proprietary, unique selling feature to the product.\n\nDiscussion: Design strategy\n\nHaving the benefit of a ‘think aloud’ transcript, we can see that Victor’s creative process has similarities with the earlier example of designers in a similar experiment, designing a litter bin. It includes a clear ‘ah-ha!’ moment of inspirational framing of a solution based on a triangular form, and we see co-evolutionary development of the\n\n107\n\n108\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nproblem and solution spaces. Also, like other designers discussed earlier, his thinking involves working simultaneously across several different levels of generality and detail.\n\nHis strategy included forming a broad, system’s view of the required product in its situation; from that, developing a particular perspective or frame for guiding the solution concept; using that framing to identify relevant first principles of engineering design to embody the concept; and also maintaining in mind the satisfaction of the client’s goal of a commercially successful consumer product. This strategy seems remarkably similar to that identified as common in the case studies of expert designers Gordon Murray and Kenneth Grange.\n\nFirst, all three designers develop a broad, high-level, systems view of the problem that they are given, in many senses ‘going beyond’ the basic problem and its initial narrow criteria. For Victor Scheinman the broader view was that of the whole situation of using the product, of the dynamic system of rider + bicycle + backpack.\n\nSecond, all three designers explore the problem and formulate a particular perspective in order to frame the problem in a way that stimulates and helps to structure the emergence of design concepts. Victor Scheinman used a distinct usability perspective in his problem structuring for the backpack carrier, for which, like Kenneth Grange and the sewing machine, he drew upon his personal experience of using such a device.\n\nThird, all three designers use the problem-solution framing to identify basic design principles that trigger the origination of their concepts and assist in the detailed development of those concepts. For Victor, it soon emerged that ‘bicycle stability’s an issue’, and so ‘it’s got to be rigid, very rigid.’ Victor then relied strongly on the basic structural principle of triangulation to achieve the rigidity and stiffness that he considered important in the design of the backpack carrier. This led him to the triangularity of his design concept, which he then used to establish a distinctive appearance for the product, to satisfy the client’s need for a unique selling feature. Victor’s design concept integrated the user’s need for a stable, rigid product with the client’s commercial need for a product that had some distinctive marketing feature. As in the sewing machine example we also see here an example of how the designer’s personal framing and use of\n\nDESIGNING TO USE\n\nfirst principles led to a concept that reconciled the designer’s goals (on behalf of the user) with the more commercial goals of the client. Victor Scheinman’s design process therefore seems to fit with the pattern and model of strategic thinking of expert designers identified in Chapter 4 (Figure 4.2). It is perhaps surprising that there appear to be such major commonalities between the case studies we have examined, which vary across real-world accounts and experimental observations, as well as across very different design domains, from Formula One racing cars to bicycle backpack carriers. Perhaps this also does suggest that there are indeed some underlying, fundamental aspects that reveal the nature and skill of expert design thinking.\n\n109",

In this experiment, a small team of three designers tackled the same design problem as did Victor Scheinman in the previous one, a carrying/fastening device for transporting a hiker’s backpack on a mountain bicycle and in the same two-hour experiment situation. However, this was not a ‘think-aloud’ protocol study, but all the team’s actions and natural conversation verbalizations were recorded for analysis. Because it involves teamwork, the design process in this case study has some significant differences from the previous study. Teamwork is of considerable importance in normal professional design activity and has become of even greater importance as design becomes a more integrated and inclusive activity involving collaboration amongst many different professions, and extended into co-designing with other project stakeholders such as clients and potential end-users. Understanding how design thinking operates in a teamwork context is therefore fundamental. The team in this study were three experienced product designers from the California office of the international, renowned design consultancy IDEO, who volunteered to participate in the experiment.\n\nTeamwork in design\n\nWorking as a member of a team introduces different problems and possibilities for the designer, in comparison with working alone. An\n\n112\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nobvious difference from single-person work is that the team members have roles and relationships within the team, relative to each other. In a normal work situation, some of these roles and relationships may be formally established; for instance, there may be seniorities of position established within the team, there may be a team leader appointed by a higher authority within the organization and there may be particular job roles or specialisms.\n\nWhether working alone or in a team, it would seem necessary to have to plan one’s activities to fit within the available time. This may be easier for an individual than for a team, but in fact explicit planning of activities is not always evident in either individual or teamwork. Furthermore, it seems to be necessary in design for unplanned, ad hoc exploratory activities to be pursued when they are perceived as relevant by the designer. This particular team did explicitly plan its activities, but if unplanned, exploratory activities are a normal feature of design activity, it becomes interesting to see how planned and unplanned actions are handled within a team.\n\nAs we have seen, it is also normal, indeed necessary, in design to interpret and re-formulate the problem given as the task. The nature of design problems means that analysing and understanding the problem is an influential part of the design process. Individual designers can form their own, possibly idiosyncratic interpretation of the problem, but a team has to reach some shared or commonly held understanding of the problem.\n\nFurthermore, in any design task, information relevant to the task has to be gathered from a variety of sources. A particular feature of the experiment design of this study was that a file of information on aspects of the problem was held by the experimenter, with relevant segments to be given to the designers if and when they asked for particular information. This helped to make explicit and observable some aspects of the necessary gathering and sharing of information that any team would have to undertake.\n\nSince a design task also means that the goal is to produce a design proposal, it is necessary to generate some ideas or concepts for what that proposal might be. An advantage of teamwork over individual work might be that a greater number and variety of concepts are generated. Again, in teamwork it will be necessary to communicate and share such concepts and ideas. It will be interesting to see how\n\nDESIGNING TOGETHER\n\nactivities of proposing and developing design concepts are handled in teamwork.\n\nA disadvantage of teamwork is likely to be that conflicts may arise between team members. Different interpretations or understandings of the problem may become evident, and different design concepts may be favoured by different members of the team. An inevitable part of design teamwork would therefore seem to be identifying, avoiding and resolving conflicts.\n\nThese aspects of teamwork will be considered here in the context of the experimental study, drawing on examples of how these issues became manifest in the team’s design activities.\n\nRoles and relationships\n\nWe do not know the normal working background of the team members of this experiment (identified anonymously as I: ‘Ivan’, J: ‘John’ and K: ‘Kerry’). We do know that they all worked for the same design consultancy firm, each had several years of previous design experience, and had similar job roles within their firm. We can assume that they were all approximately equal in the hierarchy of their normal work situation, and that there were no pre-determined roles that they brought with them to the experimental session. However, it became clear from the video recording that different roles within the team were implicitly adopted, and some of this role-adoption became semi-formalized. Some other potential role-adoption behaviour was not acknowledged and formalized within the team. Informal role- adoption is evident through repeated patterns of behaviour or types of comments by an individual.\n\nThis can be illustrated by just a few examples of the ways roles and relationships were established and played within the team, and influenced what happened. For example, immediately after the initial reading of the brief, Kerry suggested that they begin by reviewing the design of the existing prototype:\n\nK: What do we need? I guess we should look at their existing\n\nprototype, huh?\n\n113\n\n114\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nBut John suggested a different activity – checking that they all share the same understanding of the problem:\n\nJ: Yeah, em, we could also just sort of like try to quantify the problem, because, what’s your understanding of the problem first of all?\n\nThis ‘problem quantifying’ activity (clarifying the requirements in the brief) was then adopted as the first shared activity of the team; Kerry’s suggestion was implicitly over-ridden. Then, during the problem quantifying activity, Kerry suggested that gathering information from a user evaluation report of a preliminary design would be a useful activity:\n\nK: They’re not pleased with it so far, and the users’ tests have some – in fact it would be nice if we could see those users’ tests to see what the shortcomings were.\n\nShortly after, during a time-scheduling activity, Ivan mentioned the use of ‘information’ in the context of refining initial concepts. At this, Kerry again suggested that the user evaluation report might be a source of useful information, and again, this suggestion was not acted upon and was dismissed as irrelevant to the task in hand:\n\nI: Information or K: Yeah we wanna look at the em customer feedback or the users’\n\ntesting\n\nJ: Oh, yeah, so maybe, yeah, wherever that comes in, in this list\n\nAfter the ‘problem quantifying’ discussion, Ivan suggested that they should prepare a process and time schedule, and John and Ivan proceeded to do this. Later, Ivan began to sort out the various documents on the tabletop, and John took the opportunity to pick up on Ivan’s interest in scheduling:\n\nI: Let’s get this stuff sorted out J: OK you were talking about schedule stuff before, do you\n\nwanna\n\nDESIGNING TOGETHER\n\nI: Yeah, I think we should just figure out J: Just set some time limits for ourselves?\n\nLater again, when Ivan was planning the schedule, this role was confirmed for him by John, Ivan adopted the scheduler/timekeeper role and played it throughout the session:\n\nI: Five-thirty we’ll move on to the final cost and presentation, let’s\n\nleave ourselves a little bit of time\n\nK: mm mm J: Ivan’s gonna be Mister Schedule I: Yeah . . . on time, under budget\n\nIn these examples, we see that Kerry apparently experienced difficulty in getting the team to engage with the information gathering that she would prefer; that Ivan apparently accepted quite readily a facilitator role as timekeeper; and that John apparently had a strong influence on what happened in the team. These examples demonstrate some of the patterns of roles and relationships within the team that were evident throughout the session. However, these roles and relationships were not always fixed and simple. For instance, each member at times took a leadership role, although playing that role in a personal style. It seems inevitable that different ‘role playing’ behaviours will emerge in any team activity, depending on personality, experience and the task in hand, and it seems that team members could be more sensitive to each other’s preferences.\n\nPlanning and changing activities\n\nWithin the team there was a consciousness of planning the design process; members of the team were particularly aware of planning their activities and of keeping their activities to a schedule. This may seem like normal procedure for a team, but in fact not all teams in similar situations construct such an explicit procedure as this team did. Much design activity, particularly in the conceptual design stage, is unplanned and ad hoc. Other studies of designer behaviour have\n\n115\n\n116\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nidentified the spontaneous, opportunistic behaviour of designers, which occurs when they deviate from current or planned activities in order to pursue ideas as they occur. However, this creates difficulties in teamwork, where activities need to be coordinated, and an opportunistic deviation initiated by one member may be seen as irrelevant by another. In the analysis here we can observe how this team dealt with these aspects of both adhering to and deviating from planned activities.\n\nExplicit planning of the design process was initiated when Ivan suggested that the team should prepare a schedule of activities, rather than just pursuing unplanned activities. Ivan and John then proceeded to list the following design procedure (Figure 6.1):\n\nQuantify the problem Generate concepts Refine concepts Select a concept Design Present\n\nThis procedure seems to be derived from conventional models of a design process. Ivan and John seemed to share a view that this is an appropriate design process to adopt, and this process was in fact broadly followed through the rest of the session.\n\nAs noted earlier, Ivan seemed to ‘volunteer’ as the scheduler, and at important points he would draw attention to schedule and time, for example:\n\nI: We have to start making decisions, we’re already at five-fifteen\n\nAnd towards the end of the session Ivan kept the time pressure on the others; for example:\n\nI: OK um keep moving along, we have fifteen minutes to finish\n\nour design\n\nIvan’s role of scheduler/timekeeper appeared to be important to the progress of the team and having a plan for their design process meant\n\nDESIGNING TOGETHER\n\nFIGURE 6.1 The team’s design process plan. Courtesy of ‘Ivan, John and Kerry’.\n\nthat individuals could keep a check on that progress and legitimately call attention to the agreed activities when progress seemed to be drifting. Nevertheless, some activities were initiated tacitly, rather than there being an explicit decision to undertake the activity. For example, when Ivan suggested it was time to move on to the ideation phase, John agreed, but then began reading aloud from the brief in order to check that the listing of requirements was complete:\n\nI: OK shall we move into ideation? J: Yeah; I think we’ve, have we covered the, all the stuff? I’ll just\n\nread some of this out loud\n\nAlthough they had seemingly agreed that it was time to move to ideation, there was no overt decision about how to do that and in fact John began reading from the marketing report. Whilst he was\n\n117",

Nothing prior was said: there appeared to be a tacit agreement between Ivan and Kerry that they would work directly with the bike and the backpack at this point. They rather ignored John, who concluded reading and then went to join the others at the bike, and immediately entered into the activity.\n\nJohn sat astride the bike and began to talk about placing the backpack within the central open space of the bike frame. Kerry pointed out the impracticality of that; instead, she again held the backpack in position behind the saddle. John then suggested positioning it in front of the handlebars. Ivan began to record these suggestions on the whiteboard (Figure 6.2). The team had now entered upon an activity of considering alternative mounting positions for the backpack, but there was no overt decision made to adopt that activity.\n\nOne form of opportunistic deviation from a plan is a serendipitous shift of attention. For example, during discussion of weights (of the backpack and of the product that is to be designed), Kerry asked for\n\nFIGURE team’s early ‘concepts-positions’ list. Courtesy of ‘Ivan, John and Kerry’.\n\n6.2 The\n\nDESIGNING TOGETHER\n\ninformation on existing products (to check the weight of comparable products). But when this information was made available, it became more interesting as a source of design ideas, as Kerry indicated the structure of one of the existing products and Ivan realized the implication:\n\nK: This looks a lot like the little backpack frame doesn’t it? I: Yeah; you see we’ve been, it seems like mentally trying to just, because of a similarity in size and shape between the two, thinking of ways to use the same product for the same thing but I dunno that we necessarily – I mean we’re on a target for fiftyfive dollars, I mean if they’re able to sell that one for fortytwo ninetyfive . . . and if we just add a plastic part\n\nThis discussion then continued into talk based on Ivan’s experience with having a child seat on his own bike. These tacit and unplanned, drifting and discontinuous changes of activity mean that it is not always easy to track what is actually happening in teamwork. Some of the activity naturally becomes more like a conversation than a formal debate, and topics drift in and out of the conversation.\n\nGathering and sharing information\n\nThe experiment design, with its controlled access to the available information, meant that gathering information was a more overt activity than it might otherwise be. Relevant information not only had to be gathered, as in any design task, but also extracted from its source and somehow shared amongst the team. In contrast to their rather formal approach to planning and scheduling their design process, the team had a more informal approach to information gathering.\n\nThe team relied heavily on any personal experience and knowledge that members had that was relevant to the problem. For example, Kerry used her own experience to offer an opinion on off-centre loading:\n\n119\n\n120\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nK: Well I’ve done a lot of lake touring and I’ve done front panniers\n\nand I’ve done rear panniers\n\n[. . .]\n\nK: Yeah, front panniers, you could, you could set it up so you could have one of these on each side – there’s no guarantee you’d always have two – but it’s actually not as bad as you’d think to have just one\n\nDuring the earliest, problem-clarifying activity, we saw that Kerry suggested that gathering information from the user evaluation report would be a useful activity. Despite the difficulties she had in persuading the others to agree to gather information, within the first fifteen minutes of the session Kerry asked for, and received information on the target selling price, the user evaluation report and the prior prototype design. For example, she interrupted the listing of the ‘Functional Specification’ (Figure 6.3) on the board by Ivan and John to ask for information on the target selling price when this was mentioned as an item for the specification:\n\nJ: Cost target, we don’t really know what that is K: Maybe they have a – do we have that information, let’s see – do we have any specification on what the reasonable price range is?\n\nThrough her emphasis on information gathering, Kerry effectively might have been ‘volunteering’ to be the information-gatherer for the team, in the way that Ivan ‘volunteered’ to be the scheduler/timekeeper. But no formalized method for gathering and sharing information was instituted by the team, apart from the listing of requirements and concepts on the whiteboard. Perhaps because there was no formal role assigned for information gathering, some misunderstandings and errors became evident. For example, there was no suggestion in the design brief that anything other than the specific, ‘HiStar’ external- frame backpack is the backpack for which the carrying/fastening device has to be designed. But both Ivan and John were confused about this, and Kerry had to correct their misinterpretation:\n\nJ: I thought I picked up that they were going to, that they were conceiving of making an internal-frame pack, but I guess that’s\n\nDESIGNING TOGETHER\n\nFIGURE 6.3 The team’s ‘functional-specification’ and ‘features’ lists. Courtesy of ‘Ivan, John and Kerry’.\n\nnot what they’re saying; you’re saying that they make external- frame packs currently?\n\nK: mm-hmm they make external J: Does it say that they want to stick with that? I: Well it doesn’t say anything about going external or internal, so that I think that you raised a good point. Yeah, that we have that freedom right now\n\nJ: OK maybe we could get something that we’re gonna propose to them, that if it has any advantage in this application, right?\n\nI: Sure K: But they wanna use it with this external-frame backpack, it looks like . . . Because the HiStar, this is a best-selling backpack – the mid-range HiStar – they’ve decided to develop an accessory for the HiStar\n\nLate on in the session, as details of the concept design were being resolved over a drawing, Kerry and Ivan forgot that a requirement\n\n121\n\n122\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nmentioned in the brief was that the device ‘should fold down, or at any rate be stacked away easily’:\n\nK: What, the rack has to fold? J: Yes the rack has to fold K: Where does it say that? J: It says that in our spec I: Where? J: Says right here K: (reads from brief) Should fold down or stack away easily\n\nIt also became evident that the team members could misunderstand what were apparently shared concepts. For example, throughout the session, Ivan and John made several references to the ‘rooster tail problem’. Kerry did not query this until quite late in the session, when it became evident that she had not shared the same concept as the other two. She asked if they were referring to a particular tail-strap on the backpack, whereas they were actually referring to the spray of water/mud from the rear wheel of the bike that can come up onto the rider’s back:\n\nK: We’re calling this the rooster tail, this little tail? J: No, the rooster tail – when you ride in the rain and it goes\n\nwhoosh all over you\n\nThe errors and misunderstandings suggest that the team did not have a very effective strategy for gathering and sharing information. The fact that this was a short, experimental design session and that there was relevant personal knowledge available within the team probably significantly affected the team’s strategy. However, the reliance on personal knowledge, rather than public and more formalized knowledge sources, could again create misunderstanding. Even when information is apparently shared, misinterpretations and misunderstandings are evident, which means that common, shared understanding cannot always be assumed in teamwork.\n\nDESIGNING TOGETHER\n\nGenerating and adopting concepts\n\nClearly, it was necessary for the team to generate design concepts and jointly build those concepts into a specific design proposal. The team therefore had to develop initial concepts into more detailed and robust versions, and it had to decide to adopt certain concepts from amongst the several that were proposed.\n\nA design proposal may begin life as a rather vague concept that has to have a lot of development work put into it. Concepts need to be built up, with additions and variations being developed to turn the initial idea into something more robust. There were many examples of this concept building by the team members, cooperatively adding to and refining an initial concept.\n\nIn one example, Kerry suggested adapting the carrier to be used also as a form of integral locking mechanism, and this concept was further developed by the other two team members into a device for supporting as well as locking the bike:\n\nK: Maybe if you could flip it out and it becomes a bike lock, because you know, lock up your bike while you go on a hike, that would be kind of a neat feature so you could justify some extra cost maybe.\n\nI: Right, right J: Kick-stand alternative I: Pull it around your tyre and now you can stand the bike up\n\nIn another example, the team began to brainstorm from an idea that the carrier or rack device could ‘wear’ the backpack, utilizing the existing backpack straps, and proceeded into flights of fancy (another form of analogical thinking):\n\nJ: Maybe the rack wears the backpack straps just like we wear\n\nthe backpack straps\n\nK: Sure J: (laugh) K: Why not? See, like you mount shoulders back here J: Yeah, yeah, just maybe, maybe you just mount a child seat back there and you give them a child (laugh) and make him wear the backpack\n\n123\n\n124\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nI: Or a manikin K: A manikin . . . Harry the backpack holder\n\nPlastic tray\n\nOne concept appeared that was eventually adopted as the key concept that drove their final product design proposal – forming the carrier as a plastic tray. After generating some random concept lists, the team then reviewed each list to eliminate unsatisfactory concepts and identify their preferred ones (Figure 6.4). One of the significant issues that the team had identified was that the backpack’s shoulder straps, and so on, could become hazardous if they dangle down into the bicycle wheel. As they went through their pack-to-rack connector subset list, a ‘bag’ concept was stressed as a solution for holding all the loose straps, and then the ‘tray’ concept suddenly appeared:\n\nFIGURE 6.4 The team’s final ‘concepts-joining’ list. Courtesy of ‘Ivan, John and Kerry’.\n\nDESIGNING TOGETHER\n\nI: We’ll just call it that for now, bag, put it in a bag, we’re gonna need some sort of thing to do something with those straps\n\nK: To get this out of the way J: So it’s either a bag or maybe it’s like a little vacuum-formed tray\n\nkinda for it to sit in\n\nI: Yeah a tray, that’s right OK J: It would be nice I think, I mean just from a positioning standpoint, if we’ve got this frame outline and we know that they’re gonna stick with that, you can vacuum-form a tray.\n\nI: Right, or even just a small part of the tray or I guess they have\n\nthese\n\nK: Something to dress this in J: Yeah. Maybe the tray could have plastic snap features in it so\n\nyou just like snap your backpack down in it\n\nK: Snap in these rails J: It’s a multifunction part K: You just snap in these rails J: Yeah snap the rails into the tray there I: OK J: It takes care of the rooster tail problem on your pack I: uh uh, what if your bag were big, er what if you’re on er, if this tray were not plastic but like a big net you just sorta like pulled it around and zipped there\n\nJ: Maybe it could be part, maybe it could be a tray with a net and\n\na drawstring on the top of it, I like that\n\nI: Yeah, I mean em J: That’s a cool idea I: A tray with sort of just hanging down net, you can pull it around\n\nand zip it closed\n\nK: It could be like a window shade so you can kinda, it sinks back\n\nin so it just\n\nJ: Oh yeah I: It retracts, yeah K: You pull down, it retracts in J: A retracting shade I: Right, right K: So that’s not dragging in the spokes if you don’t have anything\n\nattached\n\n125",

As well as securely holding the backpack, the proposed concept solved two particular problems: the dangling straps problem and the ‘rooster-tail’ problem, which would dirty the backpack unless it is protected. The conceptual strength of the tray idea seems to lie in the way it embodied a potential solution form that, once it had been expressed, recognizably satisfied certain key problems and also recognizably could be modified and refined to accommodate other problems and requirements in a satisfactory way. It was an example of a co-evolutionary formation of a matching problem-solution pair. Interestingly, when John introduced the concept, at one hour and twenty minutes into the session, it was the first instance of the use of the word ‘tray’ and from then on ‘tray’ was repeatedly used as the defining concept for the team’s design proposal. The word ‘tray’ subsequently occurred thirty-five times in the last forty minutes of the session, thus emphasizing the key role that it played in defining the product design (Figure 6.5).\n\nPersuasion\n\nAs well as cooperating in the building and refining of concepts, team members may find it necessary to persuade the others of the value of a concept they particularly favour (often a concept they generated themselves). It is common for designers to become committed to particular concepts, even to the extent of becoming emotionally attached to a concept. There were two clear examples within this team of the need to persuade others to accept a preferred concept. In the first, John persuaded the others that his ‘tray’ concept was the best to adopt; in the second, Ivan and Kerry persuaded John to\n\nDESIGNING TOGETHER\n\nFIGURE 6.5 The team’s final design sketches for a plastic tray with folding legs to attach to the bike frame. Courtesy of ‘Ivan, John and Kerry’.\n\naccept the use of the fixed, brazed-on mounting points already on the bike frame.\n\nAs we have seen, the tray concept was quickly adopted and discussed, with ideas being added to it, but John took care to ensure that it was added to the public list of solution concepts:\n\nJ: I think tray is sorta a new one on the list, it’s not a subset of bag\n\nJohn also confirmed that he was emotionally attached to the concept:\n\nJ: Yeah I, I really like that tray idea (laugh)\n\nLater, when it became time to proceed with one preferred concept, John was quick to nominate the tray idea:\n\nJ: Well OK, well we know we like this tray idea, right?\n\nThe second example of persuasion was based around using the brazed-on mounting points on the bike frame. This was strongly\n\n127\n\n128\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nsupported by Ivan and Kerry; John had some reservations, but deferred to Kerry’s ‘expert knowledge’:\n\nJ: I guess my point is, I think if you designed it specifically around mounting points, known mounting points on this bike, you might get yourself into trouble by limiting your market\n\nK: But these are pretty standard though J: The lower ones I would agree, but the uppers? K: That’s pretty standard too J: The uppers are? K: It’s getting to be, yeah, I mean it’s not on this one; but actually\n\nsome mountain bikes are pretty scoopy and weird, but\n\nJ: We can assume Kerry has expert knowledge\n\nWhen it came to the team finally making a decision, Kerry conveyed her commitment and attachment to the braze-ons with an enthusiastic response:\n\nI: We’re gonna go with the rack, let’s go with uh, talk about braze-\n\nons – these braze-ons?\n\nK: Yeahhh!\n\nIt is quite normal for designers to become emotionally involved with their ideas; their design concepts are not merely abstract ideas, but personal insights that emerge as a result of some considerable cognitive effort. It is no wonder that these conceptual ‘babies’ are defended against other, competing concepts. This emotional commitment has to be recognized and allowed for in teamwork; creative design is unlikely to happen without it. However, team members also have to be able to recognize that some suggested concepts are just jokes (‘Harry the backpack holder’), or half-serious ideas that are intended to help the creative process along and to which the originator has no serious commitment.\n\nAvoiding and resolving conflicts\n\nIt is probably inevitable that disagreement will arise between members of a design team. We have already seen that disagreement\n\nDESIGNING TOGETHER\n\narose within this team over whether to use the existing brazed-on mounting points. More serious disagreement might have arisen if there had been competing design concepts to which different members of the team were committed. However, provided that a team collectively desires to reach an acceptable conclusion to their design task, it will have to find ways of resolving, or perhaps avoiding conflicts.\n\nIn this team, there were instances where the team members acquiesced in a kind of non-committal ‘agreement’ until one of them found an argument that closed the disagreement, and others where they postponed agreement and seemed to ‘agree to disagree’. For example, a disagreement became evident over designing for adjustability in the rack. John proposed that the support legs of the rack should be adjustable, but Kerry felt sure that this was not necessary:\n\nJ: You know one of the things that seems problematic, and it would be great from a manufacturing standpoint if you could get around it, is this distance is going to vary with frame size\n\nI: Right J: But so, y’know, we were talking about maybe those legs could extend before so that you could get some adjustability on your rack, maybe you need that anyway just so that you can adjust to different rack styles – like a telescoping tube here\n\nK: I don’t think you really need it I: (laugh) OK K: Because this is a twentysix-inch wheel, or whatever, it’s pretty standard and so if this distance – you’re right it does vary a lot, but what’s gonna change is maybe your angle on your rack is gonna change, what really is gonna happen is this is gonna be a fixed distance because if we go onto a braze-on or something down here, and you want to make sure that there’s clearance here, and then as the bike grows it might pivot up a little bit more\n\nLater, John returned again to the adjustability issue, appealing to the authority of ‘good human factors’. Both Kerry and Ivan made rather non-committal ‘agreement’ responses; Kerry just shrugged\n\n129\n\n130\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nher shoulders, Ivan said ‘OK’. Their doubt was evident to John, who admitted that what he was suggesting was ‘opinion not fact’. Ivan resolved the issue for the time being by suggesting that they can ‘look at ways of making it adjustable’ when they are finalizing their design. But the non-committal ‘agreement’ over adjustability was not permanent. At a later point John proposed a way of incorporating adjustability into the design, but Kerry came up with an argument that resolved the disagreement in her favour: if adjustability were necessary then it would feature in the already commercially available products of the Blackburn company:\n\nJ: One way to get that adjustability for the seat post height and all that stuff is if this, say this was a single bar and it went like this K: mm mm J: And it could slide along here, that way if you need to come up more, y’know pivots around the braze-ons if it needs to come up more for a taller person or for better wheel clearance or whatever, you just kinda slide it forward and put little lock- downs on it\n\nK: Yeah yeah, I don’t think you need to change this length because the wheel is fixed enough that you can rotate about the braze- on, and I mean if you really need adjustment I think all these Blackburn racks would have adjustments\n\nThese examples of deferred agreement or non-committal apparent agreement reflect normal aspects of human discussion and verbal interchange. But design team members need to be aware of when they are close to reaching actual agreement and when they are just deferring making a committed agreement. Even when there is no overt disagreement, individuals may still nurse a contrary viewpoint and return to it when the opportunity arises.\n\nDiscussion: Design cooperation\n\nThe picture that emerges from this study is probably typical of normal team design activity. We have seen how the design process\n\nDESIGNING TOGETHER\n\nproceeds by sequences of both planned and unplanned activities; how frequently there may be mistakes and misunderstandings of the brief and external information sources; how the design problem becomes understood in terms of solution concepts that are proposed and developed in a mixture of personal and cooperative endeavour; how emotional commitment becomes attached to design concepts; how conflicts of ideas arise between team members; and how such conflicts are resolved or deferred.\n\nIt is clear that teamwork is a cooperative social process, and therefore social interactions, roles and relationships cannot be ignored in cases of design activity performed by teams. It is a collaborative process and, in this study, the conventional whiteboard and drawing paper tools allowed, and were used for, shared drawing and listing activities, including different team members drawing and re-drawing over shared sketches. This sharing of representations seems fundamental to collaborative design activity. We will explore more of these issues around team working and collaborative designing in the next chapter.\n\nGiven some apparent inconsistencies and difficulties in the progress of this design team, it is perhaps important to conclude with the observation that this particular group of designers was actually a very good team. They worked cooperatively and productively, and reached a successful conclusion to the set task, within the prescribed time. Despite some of the observations made about the roles, relationships and social interactions within the team, there were no overt signs of frustration or dissatisfaction within individual members of the team. In the debriefing after the experiment they reported that they were reasonably happy with what they had achieved in the available time, and that ‘it was fun’.\n\n131\n\n132\n\n7\n\nHow designers work\n\nIn the previous two chapters we have looked quite closely into the\n\ndetails of how designers actually tackle a design problem. This was made possible through the use of laboratory ‘protocol study’ experiments that were in many senses far removed from the reality of everyday design practice. In this chapter, I will develop a broader summary and comparison of these two experimental studies, and try to draw evidence and conclusions about the way designers work when confronted with a design task. The fact that these two experimental studies have been the subjects of detailed analysis by several researchers (in an international conference on Analysing Design Activity) will help to make the comparisons and summaries, but first we must acknowledge the problems and limitations of such studies.\n\nIt was clear in some of Victor Scheinman’s ‘think aloud’ statements that he felt constrained in the experimental situation; for example, he referred to what he would do in a normal situation, such as call an expert friend, but which wasn’t possible to do in the experimental situation. (He did manage to go ‘outside’ of the experimental situation and do something that surprised the experimenters, when he telephoned for advice from a company making similar products.) However, there were other, more subtle clues within the recordings of the experiment that indicated that we cannot rely totally on ‘think-aloud’ statements as records of mental processes. Some researchers have pointed out that non-verbal thought seems to be intrinsic to design thinking and that the forced verbalization of protocol studies must interfere with non-verbal thought processes.",

On one occasion, he had to be prompted by the experimenter to resume his thinking aloud. Commenting on Victor’s silent moments, Peter Lloyd and his colleagues suggested that ‘it seems obvious that in these short periods of silence he is thinking deeply about something’, and that these silent periods ‘seem to be points of value where decisions are made, but we have no idea of the thinking behind these decisions’.\n\nSo we have to be careful about drawing very strong conclusions about deep cognitive processes from such experiments, in which a designer works alone and tries to verbalize their thinking. The second experiment, in which the three-person team of designers worked more naturally, although still within tight experimental constraints, obviously also contains many gaps in the individual thought processes, when a team member is silent, where again we can make little assumption about what the individual was thinking. However, there are lots of useful observations that can be made from such experiments as these, and in fact both these experiments have been analysed quite considerably and in depth by a number of independent researchers.\n\nCreative working\n\nWe have seen previously, in Chapter 1 and the earlier case studies, that experienced, successful designers have ways of working that enable them to reach creative insights and make promising conjectures that drive the design process forward. Whilst maintaining a deep involvement with details within a particular project, they also have a way of keeping up an apparently higher level of awareness for spotting constructive opportunities that may emerge during the process. In Victor Scheinman’s design work there were several points at which he clearly recognized breakthroughs or significant concept generation points, using expressions such as ‘Ah-ha!’ and ‘Good idea!’ These expressions indicate that he feels he is ‘on to something’, that a way forward is opening up.\n\nHOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\nÖmer Akin and Chengtah Lin analysed Victor’s work and identified a number of what they called ‘novel design decisions’: that is, non-routine decisions that ‘turn out to be critical for the progress of the entire design’. Whilst there was a large number of ‘routine’ design decisions in Victor’s protocol, Akin and Lin identified just ten novel design decisions (NDDs), which were characterized by three features: an NDD resolves a problem or bottleneck, it does not follow from previous assumptions and the designer identifies the NDD as an important feature of the overall design. A particular example is the emergence of Victor’s decision to base his design on a triangular frame, when he said: ‘It would be nice if I could, for instance, run these rods up here to some point and therefore create a triangle, this would give me great stiffness – good idea!’\n\nAkin and Lin sorted Victor’s working activities into three categories: examining (such as reading information, inspecting the available bike or backpack), thinking (whether verbalized or silent) and drawing. They then went on to record the frequency with which Victor switched between these activities and found an interesting correlation between the frequency of switching and the occurrence of NDDs. In almost all cases, they found Victor was alternating between the three activity modes in rapid succession at the point of reaching a novel design decision. Akin and Lin were rightly cautious about drawing any inference that rapid succession between different activities actually causes or produces NDDs. Their observation was only that the two seem to go together. They concluded only that ‘Our data suggest that designers explore their domain of ideas in a variety of activity modes when they go beyond routine decisions and achieve design breakthroughs’, and that ‘The designer appears to be decidedly engaged in all three major activities at the time of the NDD’. What their analysis suggests is that a designer’s level of engagement rises, and they work across a wider span of attention to different facets of the problem and solution, as they sense the achievement of a critical, creative point in the process.\n\nSome other studies have also noted the apparent importance of frequent shifts of attention or between activity modes in influencing either the creativity or overall quality of the design concepts produced. For example, in protocol studies of industrial design students, Henri Christiaans segmented the students’ activities into the three modes\n\n135\n\n136\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nof gathering information, sketching and reflecting. He suggested that the students who were more successful in producing creative design concepts were those who showed evidence of rapid alternation between the activity modes. Also, Cindy Atman and her colleagues, from studies of engineering design students, found that the overall quality of the design concepts that the students generated was related to evidence of more fluid and rapid transitions occurring between different activities in the design process, such as gathering information, generating ideas and modelling. We will look at these findings in more depth in Chapter 8.\n\nOf course, there can be no suggestion of causality; simply flitting more quickly between activity types is not necessarily going to help a designer to be more creative. It seems rather that creative working is associated with a high level of concentration and engagement, especially at points when a designer senses a critical moment in the progress of the project.\n\nTeam working\n\nDesign work is rarely a matter of a single individual working alone, as in the protocol study of Victor Scheinman. A lot of designing involves collaboration with other people, such as specialist consultants, clients or potential customers for a new product, and most design work takes place in a collaborative studio environment with and alongside colleagues. In a study of graphic designers, for example, Dianne Murray recorded the very social nature of design in practice and emphasized the openness and richness of activities within a design studio: ‘Briefing sessions take place in the studio in clear sight and sound of everyone. Work in progress is left on drawing boards; discarded sketches, photocopies, printouts and transparencies are left lying around on desks or on the light box.’ She commented that ‘Design is not hidden, it is constructed in public so other people can read it, and accepting commentary on it from somebody else is part of a tradition they embody’.\n\nSo a valuable aspect of the teamwork study here is that it enables us to observe how designers work together with one another. We have seen in that experiment how the three designers successfully worked\n\nHOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\ntogether collectively, whilst tending to play somewhat different roles. Some researchers who analysed this experiment noted the different styles and approaches that were shown by the three, and especially the differences between Kerry’s and John’s approaches. Particularly in the early part of the session, Kerry tended to want to gather specific information and to engage with the available hardware and some of its details, whereas John tended to want to step back from details, work at a more general level of the overall process and gain a broad view of the problem.\n\nThe different approaches of Kerry and John were summarized by Margot Brereton and her colleagues as wanting to pin down a solution (Kerry) and wanting to preserve ambiguity (John) (Table 7.1). Having two such complementary emphases within a team can be good, but of course it has to be managed to avoid conflict and achieve a constructive outcome. Brereton pointed out that, to resolve or avoid conflict, ‘The designers masterfully invoke the support of neutral parties such as common sense, higher principles or theories, and expert or standard practices to support their opinions. These serve to depersonalise the debate, in addition to being means of persuasion and explanation of rationale.’ These experienced designers seem to have had some effective strategies for working together that built on each other’s preferences for ways of approaching the design task. Brereton concluded that ‘the collaboration is successful because the group is well balanced in their roles and manages their negotiation well. Kerry seeks to pin down solution alternatives, John seeks to preserve ambiguity and characterize the ongoing process, and Ivan keeps the solution progress on track and acts as an arbitrator between John and Kerry’ (Table 7.2).\n\nTABLE 7.1 Different design approaches of Kerry and John\n\nKerry: Pin down solution\n\nJohn: Preserve ambiguity\n\nDesign specifically for the given backpack and bicycle Focus on rear placement (most promising candidate) Design for a fixed position Use emerging industry standard attachment method\n\nDesign for various backpacks and bicycles Consider all possible placements\n\nMake device adjustable Use attachment method usable by all bikes\n\n137\n\n138\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nTABLE 7.2 Different roles adopted by the three designers\n\nIvan\n\nJohn\n\nKerry\n\nWhiteboard manager Arbitrator Timekeeper – keeps the team on track\n\nTheorist: abstracts process from context Uses process rationale as commentary to keep team on track\n\nBike expert and user- advocate Seeks out context and detailed knowledge Seeks to ground the design with specific solution alternatives\n\nDespite the differences between the individual designers, analyses of the experiment have shown that their individual contributions to the session, whilst different in content, were quite similar in terms of quantity. Whilst John produced more solution variant ideas, equal to those of the other two together, all three contributed equally in analysis comments on solution variants, and John and Kerry each contributed exactly the same number of decisions in choosing between solution variants (Ivan rather less). Ivan, as we might now expect, made many more comments on organizing the process, in contrast to Kerry who made very few such comments.\n\nAn individual designer working alone has no one to collaborate with, so how does the work of an individual designer compare with that of a team? These two experiments, using the same design task, allow us to make such a comparison, and the question was explicitly addressed in an analysis by Gabriela Goldschmidt. She pointed out that the cognitive tasks within design can be shared out between team members, whereas a designer working on their own has to produce the full range of tasks of inquiring, formulating, suggesting, evaluating, modifying and so on. She compared several key sequences of activity between Victor and the team, and found some significant similarities, with Victor’s activities often ‘shadowing’ those of the team. She observed that\n\nHe oscillates between overviews and technical details, between functional aspects of the design product and issues related to human factors. He thinks of features, product identity and aesthetics along with stiffness, strength and ease of production.\n\nHOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\nTeam members do the same, but they can let a colleague answer a question they raise, or pick up someone else’s line of thought and build on it. The single designer has only him or herself to rely on, and he or she must act as a team and give all the answers while also asking all the questions.\n\nThese comments indicate some of the complexity that there is in the task of designing. Goldschmidt’s conclusion is that Victor implicitly ‘plays’ several roles and acts as ‘a team of one’, as in this extract from his think-aloud comments about adding some plastic clips to his rack design that would grip and hold the backpack frame: ‘Why do we want clips? Because we want to take advantage of the fact we’re using an external-frame backpack. An internal frame can’t use clips.’ Here, she suggests, Victor1 asks, Victor2 answers and Victor3 gives the design rationale. In this, there is an echo of designers ‘talking to themselves’ implicitly through their drawings and in their scribbled comments. In both Victor’s and the team processes there are also echoes and perhaps a confirmation of Donald Schön’s characterization of design as ‘a reflective conversation with the situation’.\n\nTeam leadership\n\nSome of the researchers who analysed the team’s work regarded John as acting in a ‘team leader’ role, partly because he seemed to be the ‘ideas person’ but also because he would make comments intended to focus and direct the conversation. Ivan also showed leadership in organizing the process by acting as whiteboard manager and timekeeper. We do not know what relationships or roles the team members may have brought with them from their normal work environment (they were all members of the same large design office), so there might have been some built-in hierarchies within the team. In some situations the leader might be pre-assigned to that role, or it might emerge informally through the course of a teamwork project. However, most real-world design teams do have some form of hierarchy, particularly where one member is clearly identified as being the team leader. That person is usually charged\n\n139\n\n140\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nwith responsibility for achieving a satisfactory outcome and steering the progress towards that outcome.\n\nLeadership is not just a matter of being a dominant personality, or ‘having the most to say’. Andy Dong made a very detailed analysis of the conversational patterns of this team and others in similar experiments, and suggested that the constructive influence of a member in a design team is due to the way they interact with the others and articulate shared concepts. He observed that, ‘while John is a productive individual idea generator, he also builds upon Ivan’s and Kerry’s ideas’. For example, Dong refers to points in the conversation where John ‘accumulates the discourse’ and characterizes a shared concept at that point, such as ‘maybe it’s a pack conversion kit’ or ‘maybe it’s a little vacuum-formed tray’. To ‘accumulate the discourse’ means not just to sum up but to make a constructive contribution that focuses the previous discussion onto a type of solution concept and suggests a way forward. Dong referred to this as ‘deriving a representation of the team’s shared language that frames the design concept’.\n\nHowever, in successful team design work, this constructive approach is not due to just one member of the team. Dong also looked at other teams and found that, in the more successful teams, the whole pattern of their conversation was more focused. A successful team’s discussion showed more ‘coherent’ development, in which the team members built upon each other’s contributions, progressing in a coherent form of conversation. The evidence for this lay in measuring how closely team members’ contributions to the discussion followed on from previous contributions, rather than diverging from them.\n\nThe importance and the nature of the role played by a team leader were identified by Chih-Chun Chen and colleagues in a study of a team of experienced designers in a real-world, cross-cultural (Europe/ China) automotive accessories design project. Their conclusion was that ‘the role of a leader in collaborative design can be vital to team success’. This success is based on how the team leader controls team progress by coordinating team discussions, helping the team to build up shared understandings of the problem situation and to collaborate in accumulating and progressing solution ideas. They suggested that team leadership shapes collaborative designing\n\nHOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\nthrough two principal mechanisms: guiding the team’s design process strategy and ensuring effective communication within the team. A key aspect of effective communication is the role of the leader as a ‘communication hub’, receiving ideas and opinions from team members and relaying them back to the speaker and the rest of the team for clarification, exploration and confirmation. For this to be effective, team members need to feel comfortable in sharing their comments and proposals; when a team is working well members do not respond negatively to each other’s comments and proposals but by proposing re-interpretations or constructive alternatives.\n\nFrom their study of teamwork in medical product design, mentioned in Chapter 4 with respect to co-evolution, Stefan Wiltschnig and his colleagues also emphasized the role of the team leader in initiating constructive, co-evolutionary creative design episodes. This was particularly so with regard to making changes in the initial problem requirements that subsequently led to solution proposals. These initiatives were often purposefully introduced by the team leader. Witschnig reported that ‘many design conversations were initiated by the team leader mentioning or amending a design requirement. Other members of the design team would then contribute useful ideas, either by way of developing the interpretation of the requirement or by way of generating and evaluating solution possibilities.’\n\nAn example of this was an episode initiated by team leader K and progressed by team member M. They are discussing product features for the ease and safety of use in a type of ostomy bag, which is worn by the user to hold fluid draining from their body:\n\nK: What else have we got . . . we’ve talked about whether we could do something to avoid making it impossible to fold it this way. But that’s a problem for\n\nM: The ones who’d like to – yes, it’s a problem for those who want to fold it that way while emptying. If you could make something so it was not so high up\n\nK: So you couldn’t fold it\n\nHere, team leader K initiates a discussion on how the user might mishandle the bag and how the fastening of the bag might be designed to prevent that. Team member M confirms the problem and suggests\n\n141\n\n142\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nnot a specific idea but a generic approach of making it ‘not so high up’, and K confirms the implicit intention of making the mishandling impossible. Over the next few minutes the team pursued a string of related solution suggestions involving changing the bag closure in several ways to overcome the folding issue, such as incorporating colour coding or adding text, or changing the user instruction manual.\n\nThe researchers commented that ‘These episodes did not seem to involve great leaps in creative discovery regarding how the formulation of the problem should change, but rather entailed minor increments being introduced by the team leader in order to change the focus to another part of the design problem space.’ However, they added that the team leader’s role ‘seems to be vital for the achievement of organisational goals relating to the delivery of high-quality, innovative design solutions’. In initiating and coordinating changes of focus the team leader is performing acts of metacognition – which means thinking about one’s own thinking or reflecting on the team’s process and progress and making changes as necessary. Individual designers working alone also perform these acts of metacognition in working as a ‘team of one’.\n\nDesign process\n\nExperienced designers know that it is possible to go on almost forever gathering information and data about a design problem, but that they have to move on to generating solution proposals, which in themselves begin to indicate what is relevant information. In a design project it is often not at all clear what ‘the problem’ is; it may have been only loosely defined by the client, many constraints and criteria may be undefined and everyone involved in the project may know that goals may be redefined during the project. In designing, ‘problems’ are often defined in relation to ideas for their ‘solution’, and designers do not typically proceed by first attempting to define their problems rigorously, which they know may be impossible. Of course, this can mean that important information is overlooked or might be discovered only very late in the design process, causing disruption and delay. For these reasons, there have been attempts to set out formal, metacognitive models of an ideal design process and\n\nHOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\nsuggestions for methodologies or structured approaches that should lead designers efficiently towards a good solution.\n\nIt is therefore interesting that, in our team design experiment, the team did set out a model for their process and tried to stick to it. Their model process consisted of the following stages:\n\nQuantify the problem Generate concepts Refine concepts Select a concept Design Present\n\nSome analysts have looked at the actual process that the team (and Victor) followed. For example, Joachim Günther and colleagues analysed the individual statements in the team’s conversations into three types, concerned with (1) clarifying the task, (2) searching for concepts and (3) fixing the concept. Charts of their analyses of the team’s and Victor’s processes are given in Figure 7.1. We can\n\nFIGURE 7.1 Principal phases of the team’s (top) and Victor Scheinman’s (bottom) design processes.

For the team, throughout the first half of the session there was a lot of iteration between ‘clarifying the task’ and ‘searching for concepts’. What the team was actually doing through this period was generating lots of partial concepts and then considering the implications of those concepts. In that way they were exploring the problem through possible solutions. They did not spend very long on their initial task of ‘quantify the problem’ in isolation from generation of concepts, but after about twenty minutes they began to consider specific aspects of solution concepts and then (thanks to Ivan) organized this into searches for ‘joining concepts’, divided into joining ‘pack to rack’ and ‘rack to bike’. The chart in Figure 7.1 (top) shows clearly that ‘searching for concepts’ dominated most of the team’s process, but came to a fairly quick stop soon after they identified the ‘tray’ concept, at around eighty minutes. Overall, they followed the activities that they had set out in their model process but not in a strict sequence of separate activities.\n\nIt might seem surprising that ‘clarifying the task’ is an activity that recurs throughout so much of the session, as it did in the team’s process. But it is quite normal in the design process that there is an ongoing interactive, co-evolutionary exploration and development of both the problem and the solution. A pattern similar to this team’s activity pattern has been found in other studies and is not a-typical. For example, Vinod Goel found, in protocol studies of architectural design, that ‘problem structuring’ could constitute as much as 30 per cent of the overall task time, and although it was concentrated near the beginning of the task it could recur constantly until almost the very end of the session.\n\nThe chart of Victor’s process in Figure 7.1 (bottom) shows more clear-cut separation of activities, especially in the first half-hour, in which he concentrated on ‘clarifying the task’ by reading the brief and the evaluation report on the previous prototype solution, and telephoning a company that makes similar products. Victor spent some time in familiarizing himself with the task, including considering his own personal experiences of riding with a backpack as well as collecting information from others. A concern with user issues was more evident in Victor’s process than it was in that of the team. He ‘internalized’ the problem information, rather than making\n\nHOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\nexternalized lists (perhaps because he did not have to share and agree it with anyone else), decided on a preferred mounting position for the rack and implicitly on its material (tubular aluminium) and began a process of designing by drawing – making sketches of the bicycle and evolving a structure that met his user requirements for stability and stiffness (and the client’s requirement for uniqueness). In fact, much of his design activity was similar to that of the team, in that he made progress by proposing a partial solution concept and then analysing its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nVictor commented at one point that ‘scheduling my time on these things, that’s the hard part’, and he frequently commented on the time constraint he was working under. Organizing a design process is quite a difficult task, because there has to be allowance for free- flowing activity within an overall schedule of things to be done within a time limit. The team’s design process seemed quite complex; it was free-flowing, but it was also quite controlled. Brereton et al. concluded that ‘the designers are continuously engaged in multiple activities at different levels. Although they focus in on issues, they continuously monitor the progress of the solution from the point of view of various requirements and solution alternatives. They reflect on their course of action, monitoring and modifying their process.’\n\nThe differences, such as they are, between the design processes of Victor and the team seem to be more to do with the differences between individual and team working processes. Victor was ‘a team of one’ and he was not subject to the pressures and constraints of working with other people, such as we considered in the analysis of teamwork in the previous chapter.\n\nStructure versus spontaneity\n\nSome other studies have identified that designers usually start with a structured plan for their design process, as our team did, but frequently slip from the plan into opportunistic pursuit of issues or partial solutions that catch the designer’s attention, again as our team did. It has been argued that opportunistic behaviour, often derogatorily regarded elsewhere, is appropriate behaviour for designers because it allows the flexibility to deal with design\n\n145\n\n146\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nproblems and the ‘opportunities’ that emerge in the design process. For example, Willemien Visser made a study of an experienced mechanical engineering designer who claimed to be following a structured approach, but Visser found frequent deviations from this plan. She noted that ‘The engineer had a hierarchically structured plan for his activity, but he used it in an opportunistic way. He used it only as long as it was profitable from the point of view of cognitive cost. If more economical cognitive actions arose, he abandoned it.’ Thus Visser regarded reducing ‘cognitive cost’ – that is the mental load of maintaining a principled, structured approach – as a major reason for abandoning planned actions and instead, for example, delving into pursuing a partial solution at a relatively early stage of the process.\n\nRaymonde Guindon also emphasized the opportunistic nature of design activities, which was evident in her protocol studies of three experienced software system designers. Guindon stressed that ‘designers frequently deviate from a top-down approach. These results cannot be accounted for by a model of the design process where problem specification and understanding precedes solution development and where the design solution is elaborated at successively greater levels of detail in a top-down manner.’ Guindon observed the interleaving of problem specification with solution development, ‘drifting’ through partial solution development, and jumps into exploring suddenly recognized partial solutions, which were categorized as major causes of ‘opportunistic solution development’. However, rather than regarding this opportunism as a weak feature of design behaviour, Guindon suggested it might be inevitable, because ‘These deviations are not special cases due to bad design habits or performance breakdowns but are, rather, a natural consequence of the ill-structuredness of problems in the early stages of design’. Like Visser, Guindon also referred to ‘cognitive cost’ as one possible explanation for such behaviour: ‘Designers find it advantageous to follow a train of thought temporarily, thus arriving at partial solutions at little cognitive cost.’\n\nClearly, whether it’s a single designer or a design team they have to monitor and adjust their own design process as they move through a project; they must occasionally take a step back from the activities they are directly engaged in to reflect on their progress. Dagny Valgeirsdottir and Balder Onarheim studied a team working\n\nHOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\nin automotive design and observed that ‘Process awareness is a cognitive creativity skill that individuals in a design team use to facilitate a creative process’. They identified the operation of this metacognitive skill occurring where someone in the team uses phrases such as ‘we need to’, ‘we should’, ‘I think we’ or words related to process awareness such as ‘insight’, ‘focus’, ‘fixated’ or ‘incubation’. In the short account earlier of the problem of users potentially mishandling an ostomy bag, the team leader initiated a change of focus with the phrase ‘so what have we got?’, suggesting a summarizing and progress review point in the process.\n\nCollaborative designing\n\nIt seems especially hard in teamwork to follow a tightly prescribed process because individual members may have individual preferences for ways of working. There is often a natural flow to design processes that can run counter to a prescription for what should happen when. The team process in collaborative designing therefore requires particular attention to how natural conversation can be guided into a constructive, productive and creative process. One means of helping to do this is to externalize aspects of the conversation into a shared public space.\n\nWe saw in our team design experiment how they used a whiteboard for listing process steps, problem structures and solution ideas. The whiteboard is a means of externalizing and recording thoughts, and also supports moments of reflection when the team pauses and considers what they have on the whiteboard. Through this kind of externalizing, a design team is able to share and deal with complex structures and relationships that are very difficult or impossible to hold solely within the brain. The use of sticky notes, either on a whiteboard or some other flat surface, has now become almost ubiquitous in team processes of all kinds for this kind of externalization. In design teamwork, they have joined other common supportive media for designing such as sketching, modelling and prototyping.\n\nThe use of sticky notes in collaborative design has been studied to identify how they support particular aspects of design thinking.\n\n147\n\n148\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nLinden Ball and his colleagues pointed out that ‘sticky notes can be used quickly, easily and informally to generate many potentially relevant – albeit somewhat disconnected – ideas without designers needing to possess full insight into where the generated information might be leading. In a short amount of time a blank workspace can thus become populated with a multitude of visually distinct ideas’. They argued that ‘to disregard the humble sticky note as a key support material in creative design is to ignore a whole sphere of cognition that underpins effective real-world design practice’.\n\nBall suggested that the properties of sticky notes make them not just an easy means of recording and structuring ideas, but that they are inherently supportive of design thinking in collaborative processes. The visual and adjustable display of sticky notes supports perceptions and other cognitive design processes in identifying and modifying conceptual relations amongst the parts to form wholes. Ball proposed that the use of sticky notes makes it possible for a design team ‘(i) to consider the parts as “variables” in a system, thereby enabling the exchange of parts, while retaining the structural whole; (ii) to restructure the whole representation into new representations by re-configuring the parts; and (iii) to explore and establish dynamically new possible structural links to existing concepts, thereby gradually and generatively “building-up” or advancing a conceptual whole with new emergent properties’. That outline might be regarded as offering a neat summary not only of collaborative designing processes but also of design thinking more generally. Like drawing and sketching in design (as I commented in Chapter 4), sticky notes permit and encourage simultaneous, non-hierarchical participation in collaborative designing, using a common representation.\n\nFrequently, collaborative designing includes designers working with a wide range of participants or stakeholders, including end-users of the proposed design result. This involves different attitudes towards and patterns of design activity that have to be accommodated within the design process. In user-centred workshops in communication design for sustainable cleaning in childcare centres and for asthma management and awareness, Simone Taffe found that non-designer participants were happy to engage in idea generation but reluctant to evaluate the collected ideas. For example, ‘the childcare staff were reluctant to place evaluation dots on the cleaning moodboard\n\nHOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\nas they did not want to criticise their co-workers’ ideas or have any form of disagreement about their co-created posters’. She also found that a ranking method often used by communication designers was resisted by the asthma staff because\n\nthe words to be sorted presented a mix of negative and positive issues. Seeing printed cards displaying the negative aspects of [their own] work practices created an immediate barrier for the asthma staff, preventing them from participating in the card ranking activity. The designer technique of ranking was perceived as confrontational whereas discussion was more conducive to forming a consensus towards good ideas.\n\nCollaborative designing is therefore clearly a social process and so progress can be influenced by normal issues of social interaction, such as reluctance to criticize others in a group. Externalizing aspects of the process, through the use of whiteboards, idea cards, sticky notes and other modelling, is a way of opening up the design process and making social interaction cooperative and creative. However, collaborative designing has to be carefully managed to create a successful process of social and creative interaction that enhances group knowledge and skill.\n\nCreative designing\n\nIn making an analysis of our backpack-carrier team design experiment, David Radcliffe spotted a weakness in the team’s process that constrained their creativity. They decomposed the overall problem into sub-problems of joining ‘pack to rack’ and ‘rack to bike’, as shown in Ivan’s whiteboard lists of the various concepts (Figure 6.4). At the core of their problem structuring was the concept of a ‘rack’. But the design brief that the team was given asked for ‘a carrying/fastening device’ – something much more open than directly specifying ‘a rack’. This particular interpretation severely limited much of the team’s exploration of the problem.\n\nRadcliffe noticed that this decomposition of the problem made it difficult for the team to consider solution concepts that arose naturally\n\n149\n\n150\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nin the conversation but that did not fit the agreed decomposition. At separate times both Kerry and John commented on the fact that the existing external frame of the backpack was in itself a structure something like a rack. Kerry commented that ‘We’ve already got that frame on the pack; it would be nice if we can take advantage of that’. A little later, John commented that ‘there’s a kind of other class of solutions outside of our design problem [structure], and that’s that you could somehow use the external frame and wouldn’t need the rack’. Just a little later again, Kerry formulated a solution concept for a simple device, suggesting that ‘maybe the attachment is kind of a leg that attaches right to the external frame’. Radcliffe notes that, ‘Ivan records the concept on the whiteboard as “legs on frame” under the “pack to rack” heading . . . There is no explicit acknowledgement that this concept falls outside the pack-to-rack/rack-to-bike dichotomy. In terms of the recorded work of the team, listing concepts under suitably decomposed headings takes precedence over capturing less structured or controllable emergence of design ideas.’\n\nA ‘no-rack’ concept clearly does not fit anywhere within the team’s problem decomposition. Although the team went on to consider some more ideas for such a ‘no-rack’ concept, eventually it was lost as they returned to their more orderly sequence of planned activities. This loss of a potentially radical, creative solution was precisely due to the team creating, and sticking to, a specific structuring of the problem. In collaborative and co-designing, which often has a broad brief and can include heterogeneous teams comprising not only designers but also clients, customers and other specialists, leaving the problem structure as open as possible for as long as possible can help to avoid premature fixation and the unnecessary restriction of solution types.\n\nDavid Radcliffe also concluded from his analysis that the team’s progress to a solution concept demonstrated that the emergence of creative ideas cannot be constrained to a particular place or sequence within a design process. He pointed out, ‘It is clear that design ideas emerge where they will in the continuum of the design conversation . . . Ideation cannot be constrained to occur only during the prescribed time for this activity as dictated by notions of due process and proper sequence of phases in design.’ To provide a specific emphasis, Radcliffe pointed out that the team’s decisive ‘tray’ concept was\n\nHOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\ngenerated during what was supposed to be the evaluation phase to ‘select a concept’.\n\nThe creative bridge\n\nThere seemed to be the classic notion of a ‘creative leap’ in the team’s design activity when John proposed that ‘maybe it’s like a little vacuum-formed tray’, and this tray concept became key to developing the team’s final design proposal. Did the tray idea just come ‘out of the blue’ or was it an ‘accumulation’ of previous ideas and contributions? It was certainly the first instance of the use of the word ‘tray’, but some possibly related concepts that had been mentioned earlier included references to plastic as a possible material and flat, solid forms for the rack device. In fact, nearly twenty minutes earlier than he first expressed the tray idea, John had referred to a similar kind of rack idea that he recalled: ‘Actually a friend of mine suggested, a couple of years ago, a product that he would do, an injection-moulded rack that would kind of like fold down.’ And Ivan immediately responded with recalling a similar bicycle luggage device that he remembered: ‘It’s like a little rack that was flat, it had these panels . . . but these panels were solid, it had little wheels . . . and it would come off and then it would be like a little trailer.’ Ivan went on to explain how it worked when folded up on the back of a bicycle by over-drawing it on a sketch that Kerry had made (silently) much earlier of something very like a ‘tray’ on the back of a bike (Figure 7.2).\n\nSo ideas related to the device as a tray-like, flat sheet, probably of plastic, had been suggested earlier, both explicitly by John and Ivan and implicitly by Kerry in her sketch. The significant difference seems to be the overt expression by John of this concept as a ‘tray’ – that is a flat surface with a raised lip around its circumference. The strength of the ‘tray’ concept seems to be that it identified and summarized an easily recognizable, appropriate solution form, in a way that was significantly different from the earlier concepts of a ‘flat’, ‘folded’, ‘panel’. We can see that it drew upon those earlier concepts that, in retrospect, seem very similar, but that lacked the apparently critical feature of ‘containment’ that a tray has. Its generation was perhaps aided by the immediately prior consideration of a more extreme form\n\n151",

Like the bag, the tray concept seemed to focus on one particular problem (containing the backpack’s straps) as the most significant consideration, but it was quickly elaborated to satisfy a range of other problems and functions. John’s expression of the concept was also timely – it came at the point when the team was trying to ‘select a concept’ and move on from problem exploration and concept generation to final design work.\n\nIt might seem that John’s apparently sudden expression of the ‘tray’ concept is an example of a ‘creative leap’. However, our analysis has shown that the expression of the concept actually ‘accumulates’ a lot of prior concepts, examples and discussions within the team. It is more like the key frame of ‘keep newspapers separate’ that occurred for the litter bin designers in Chapter 4. Creative designing is not necessarily the making of a sudden ‘leap’ from the problem space into the solution space, from requirements to solution, but is the formulation of an apposite proposal. Once the proposal is made, it is seen to be an apposite response to the given, explored and framed problem situation. It is an abductively reasoned conclusion that creates a resolution of the design requirements on the one hand and the design structure of a potential new product on the other, a matching problem-solution pair. The apparent sudden illumination that\n\nHOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\ncan occur in creative designing is therefore more like constructing a ‘creative bridge’ between the problem space and the solution space than like taking a ‘creative leap’ from one to the other.\n\nSummary\n\nDesigning is usually a social process of teamwork, with members playing different roles; a designer working alone has to internally play the different roles. The leadership influence of a member in a team arises from how they interact with the others, articulating shared understanding of the problem and accumulating and progressing solution idea concepts. A successful team’s discussion shows coherent development, with the team members building upon each other’s contributions. Process awareness is a cognitive creativity skill that facilitates progress. In initiating and coordinating the process, a team leader is performing acts of metacognition. A design team may set up a planned procedure, but they recognize that this is a framework that will be adapted as the work progresses. Externalizing aspects of the process, through the use of sticky notes, drawings and other modelling, are ways of opening up the design process and making social interaction cooperative and creative. When a key concept is voiced other members of the team recognize it as important and apposite, combining a resolution of the design requirements on the one hand and the structure of a potential design solution on the other: a proposal of a matching problem-solution pair. The apparent sudden illumination is more like constructing a creative bridge between the problem space and the solution space than like taking a creative leap from one to the other.\n\nSources\n\nFull citations are given in the References.\n\nÖmer Akin and Chengtah Lin: Design protocol data and novel design\n\ndecisions, Design Studies.\n\n153\n\n154\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nCindy Atman, et al.: Comparing freshman and senior engineering\n\ndesign processes, Design Studies.\n\nLinden Ball, et al.: Sticky notes as a kind of design material, Design\n\nStudies.\n\nMargot Brereton, et al.: Collaboration in Design Teams, in Analysing\n\nDesign Activity.\n\nChih-Chun Chen, et al.: The Importance of Leadership in Design\n\nTeam Problem-solving, in Analysing Design Thinking.\n\nHenri Christiaans: Creativity in Design.

In the main, my approach has been one of empirical investigation, based on reported experience or observation and analysis. In explaining and relating these various studies, I have tried to build an evidence-based understanding of how designers think and work, and the nature of expert performance in design. In this final chapter I will consider design expertise more generally, its development from novice to expert, and suggest that the developed cognitive skills of design thinking can be regarded as a particular form of intelligence.\n\nExperts and novices\n\nMany of the classic studies of expertise have been based on examples of game-playing (such as chess) or on comparisons of experts versus novices in solving routine problems (e.g. in puzzle solving). These studies are generally examples of solving what are called well-defined problems, whereas designers characteristically deal with ill-defined problems, where there is no definitive, complete formulation of the problem and no single or verifiably correct solution. Some of the standard results from the classic studies of expertise do not match with results from studies of expertise in creative domains\n\n156\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nsuch as design. For example, creative experts might reformulate the given task so that it is more problematic – that is deliberately treat it as ill-defined – which is contrary to the assumption that experts will generally solve a problem in the ‘easiest’ way or certainly with more ease than novices. In some ways, therefore, experts in creative fields treat problems as ‘harder’ problems than do novices. We saw examples of that in the discussion of design ability in Chapter 1 and in the case studies of Gordon Murray and Kenneth Grange: examples of designers going beyond the brief or ‘given’ problem.\n\nExperts will often see a given problem as more complex than do novices, partly because of their greater experience. In studies of problem-solving, novice behaviour is usually associated with a ‘depth-first’ approach, which means that the novice identifies a problem aspect and immediately begins exploring its solution in depth. In designing, this results in partial sub-solutions that may be difficult to reconcile together into a satisfactory overall solution. The strategies of experts, however, are usually regarded as exhibiting predominantly breadth-first approaches, that is starting with a broad problem exploration and developing partial sub-solutions together in parallel. In designing, this is reflected in expert designers’ considering broader contextual aspects of the design problem before moving on to aspects of more detail.\n\nSome depth-first and breadth-first aspects were observed between the behaviour of novice and experienced designers in studies by Saeema Ahmed and her colleagues. They found clear differences between the behaviours of new graduate entrants to the engineering profession and much more experienced design engineers. The novices used ‘trial and error’ techniques of generating and implementing a design modification, evaluating it, then generating another and so on through many iterations. Experienced engineers were observed to make a preliminary evaluation of their tentative decisions before implementing them and making a final evaluation. They used the foresight they had gained from experience to consider whether it seemed worthwhile to move further into the implementation stage of a design decision.\n\nHowever, a more complex view has gradually emerged as more studies are made of expert designer behaviour. We have already seen how designers can exhibit opportunistic behaviour in pursuing\n\nDESIGN EXPERTISE\n\ninteresting conjectures in more depth before returning to a broader strategy. This was contextualized further by Linden Ball and his colleagues, who studied the strategies of both hardware and software designers and suggested that ‘experts will often tend to mix both breadth-first and depth-first solution development strategies . . . the preferred strategy of expert designers is a top-down, breadth-first one, but experts will switch to depth-first design to deal strategically with situations where their knowledge is stretched. Thus, depth- first design is a response to factors such as problem complexity and design uncertainty.’ This suggests that, as well as spotting promising opportunities for solution generation, even expert designers will run up against unfamiliar problems and will have to make some initial in-depth exploration of partial solution concepts in order to assess their viability.\n\nFrom novice to expert\n\nWe are all familiar with the concepts of the novice learner and the expert performer, and aware that something happens in the development from one to the other. A novice undergoes training and education in their chosen field and then at some later point becomes an expert.\n\nThe development of expertise usually seems to pass through different phases (Figure 8.1). In all fields, the accumulation of experience is a vital part of the transformation from novice to expert. For some people, the expert level of achievement is where they remain, perhaps with some continued moderate improvement before reaching their peak and beginning their decline. A few manage to go beyond the level of their peers into a further stage of development, reaching outstanding levels of achievement and mastery. At the other end of the scale of maturity, at a young age, all of us are introduced to a variety of human activities, whether it be making music, playing football, drawing pictures or writing stories. We all improve a little, but some, as noted earlier, will begin to practice with a dedication – and probably a joy or even obsession – that sets them apart.\n\n157\n\n158\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 8.1 Progressive stages in the development of expertise.\n\nMoving from one level of expertise to another is not necessarily a steady progression. It is not simply a matter of knowing more and learning to work more quickly or smoothly. The changes in level involve learning to work in different ways. This shift to working in a different way can develop almost unnoticed by the learner but can mean shifts in level of attention that we all experience in learning a skill, as the fundamental practices become performed less consciously and flow more easily.\n\nThere has been much more of a history of studies on understanding expertise and expert performance in fields and contexts other than design, including chess, music, science and sports. From these studies, there is a general view that expertise can only be developed over time as a person matures. Usually, there comes a point when a peak of performance is reached and then a seemingly inevitable decline begins. This performance peak will be reached at different ages in different domains: for physical sports, it may be around the age of middle-twenties, whereas in cognitive activities it may not be until much later in life; in the sciences, people seem to produce their best work in their thirties, whilst in the arts it may be in their forties. Some outstanding individuals seem to defy the general pattern of development-peak-decline and continue producing great work well into later years.\n\nA general aspect that seems agreed from studies of expertise is that it requires a minimum period of practice and sustained\n\nDESIGN EXPERTISE\n\ninvolvement before performance reaches a recognized expert level of achievement – at least ten years from first involvement. This is a matter not simply of experience or exposure to the field of endeavour but of dedicated application. One of the key factors in the acquisition of expertise is believed to be deliberate, sustained, guided practice.\n\nThe psychologist Anders Ericsson, who is an expert in the study of expertise, has suggested that ‘The attained level of performance of many types of experts, such as musicians, chess players and athletes, is closely related to their accumulated amount of deliberate practice’. Usually, a young person may display a certain aptitude or interest, and parents or teachers then encourage and guide their development. But without the dedicated application of the individual, levels of performance will remain modest. Again, according to Ericsson,\n\nSuperior expert performance is primarily acquired . . . Many thousands of hours of deliberate practice and training are necessary to reach the highest levels of performance . . . Most international masters emphasise the role of motivation, concentration, and the willingness to work hard on improving performance . . . The masters seem to consider inborn capacities and innate talent as relatively unimportant.\n\nSo in all fields it seems that the key to the development of expertise is practice, practice, practice.\n\nDevelopment of expertise\n\nAs we have seen, many studies of expert designers suggest that from initial scoping of the given problem they move on to early solution conjectures and use these conjectures as a way of exploring and defining the problem and solution together. This solution-focused nature of designing was first noted by Bryan Lawson in comparisons he made of the problem-solving behaviours of scientists and architects. Lawson set the same problem-solving exercise for students of science and architecture and found that senior students could be distinguished as adopting predominantly either problem-focused or solution-focused strategies. The science students attempted to\n\n159",

These differences were noticeable amongst senior students but not amongst first-years, so it appeared that the architects had learned their solution-focused strategy during their education as an effective strategy for resolving the kinds of problems that they had been set. They had learned to think like designers.\n\nEducation in design has long-established practices that are assumed to help the progression from novice to expert, although in general they are not based on evaluated evidence. There is still rather limited understanding of the differences between novice and expert performance in design, and how to help students move from one to the other, but there has been some progress.\n\nFor example, Henri Christiaans found, from protocol studies of industrial design students, that junior students did not seek a lot of information on the project they were given, and tended to ‘solve a simple problem’, being unaware of a lot of potential criteria, difficulties and possibilities. These are characteristics of a novice. Amongst senior students he found that they could be divided into two types. Although they all gathered more project information than junior students, for one type the activity of gathering information was too dominant, and sometimes just a substitute activity for actually moving on to design work. The more successful type, in terms of the quality of their solutions, gathered rather less information but considered it more carefully and gave the impression of consciously building up a broader view of the problem.\n\nVery similar conclusions were reached by Cynthia Atman and her colleagues, who found from protocol studies of engineering students that, amongst first-year students ‘those who spent a large proportion of their time defining the problem did not produce quality designs’. As with the industrial design students, it seemed that the novice engineering students just solved simple interpretations of the problem or became stuck in problem definition and did not progress satisfactorily into further stages of the design process. However, amongst senior students Atman did find that attention to initial ‘problem scoping’ (i.e. ‘adequately setting up the problem before analysis begins’, including gathering a larger amount and wider\n\nDESIGN EXPERTISE\n\nrange of problem-related information) did result in better designs. In general, developing greater expertise means developing a broader and more complex understanding of what has to be achieved, and this seems to be the case in design: more experience leads to more sophisticated problem scoping and defining.\n\nDeveloping design thinking\n\nCynthia Atman has led a significant programme of studies into the nature of design expertise and its development through education. She and her colleagues focused on recording and assessing the design processes of engineering students, through a series of laboratory-type protocol studies of design projects in different years of study. They also made complementary studies of the processes of experienced professional designers working on the same projects as were set for the students. They recorded the sequences of different activities that were employed by the designer throughout a design process, from problem definition to idea generation, through modelling and evaluating proposals, to communication of a final design. For each designer, the pattern of activities was portrayed in standardized timeline plots of their individual design processes. These timeline plots help to visualize and convey the process of designing. Figure 8.2 shows example design process timeline plots for students and expert designers tackling a playground design project. Each entry along the horizontal left to right timeline indicates the designer’s focus of attention across the rows of different types of activity.\n\nA significant difference that can be observed between the patterns of activities is that experienced designers, as they progress through a design project, transition back and forth across a broad range of activities throughout the whole process. There is a general overall progression from problem definition and gathering data to deciding on and communicating a final proposal, with the majority of the designer’s attention being given to modelling ideas for solutions, but their attention is also constant across all the different activities, with frequent switching between them. Atman called this a ‘cascade pattern’ that is typical of experienced designers. It shows a ‘cascade’ of the designer’s attention, generally from top-left to lower-right in the\n\n161\n\n162\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 8.2 Design process timeline plots for a playground project.

It is not a simple, direct flow from problem definition through each of the other activities to communication of a final proposal.\n\nIt emerged from Atman’s studies that the development of these patterns of more experienced design behaviour can be assisted through education, developing as students progress from their first to final years of study. Figure 8.3 shows the differences in the design process timelines for one student, tackling the same two problems as a first-year and as a graduating senior student. The problems were of different levels of complexity: a relatively simple ‘Design a ping- pong ball launcher’ and a more complicated ‘Design a street crossing system’. For each problem exercise the timelines clearly show that, as a senior, the student not only spent more time on the problems but also exhibited the richer, ‘cascade’ pattern of activities. In general, in comparison with the first-years, senior students tend to gather more information across a broader set of issues, consider more alternative\n\nDESIGN EXPERTISE\n\nFIGURE 8.3 Design process timelines for the same student as a first-year and as a senior. Courtesy of Cynthia Atman, with permission of Elsevier, Design Studies.\n\nsolutions and transition more frequently between types of design activities.\n\nAtman and her colleagues also compared timeline design process patterns against the quality of the resulting designs. Using a children’s playground design problem, they assessed the quality of the designs on aspects such as whether the initial constraints of the problem were met, they satisfied playground standards for specific elements of the proposed design and met expected experience outcomes for the users. Figure 8.4 shows some example timeline patterns for senior students, ranked by the assessed quality of the resulting designs. Quality assessment scores range from low (at the top), to middling, and high (at the bottom). The results show that higher solution quality scores correlate with designers using a greater range of activities and a greater intensity of transitions between activities, with attention being paid across all types of activity throughout the design process. Better designers exhibit richer process behaviours.\n\nAtman found that expert designers working on the same playground\n\ndesign project were significantly more likely than the students to:\n\nspend more overall time solving the problem\n\ngather more information, across a broader set of issues\n\n163\n\n164\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 8.4 Example design process timelines for senior students ordered by quality of the resulting design solutions.

So the evidence from Atman’s extensive studies in the\n\nDESIGN EXPERTISE\n\ndevelopment of expertise is that students do develop along a path towards expert behaviours, growing in their capacity to identify and integrate relevant factors, and to perform more complex design processes, and that development continues with more experience. Atman and her colleagues have fed their observations and analyses of design process behaviours back into education, to both students and tutors, and found that the timelines evidence encourages a greater awareness of design expertise and its development, and has a positive educational effect.\n\nExpertise in teamwork\n\nAtman and her colleagues also found the rich, cascade process pattern occurring in team design as well as in individual designers. In analysing the activity of the experienced design team working on a digital pen project that was introduced in Chapter 2 to illustrate analogical thinking, she and her colleagues generated a timeline plot covering the joint discussion of all seven team members. Figure 8.5 shows the team’s timeline, over phases or episodes characterized by the researchers as developing changes in the team’s focus. The session began with a brief introductory preamble in which the team leader reviewed the given design problem with the team; the first design episode focused on brainstorming ideas; the second episode shifted to focusing on a particular solution type; and the final episode was concerned with developing details of the proposed\n\nFIGURE 8.5 Design process timeline for a seven-member team showing a cascade pattern over episodes focusing on idea generation, exploring a selected concept and confirming details of the concept. Courtesy of Cynthia Atman.\n\n165\n\n166\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nsolution. The timeline plot shows how the team transitioned regularly and frequently between the various types of activities throughout the process, similar to expert individual designers, with a gradual progression from problem definition into generating ideas and on to modelling and technical feasibility issues.\n\nExperience\n\nWhat we have seen throughout this book is that designing is a form of skilled behaviour. It has also become clear that, as with other skills, successful behaviours are something that can be learned. The performance of a skilled practitioner, whether musician, footballer or designer, appears to flow seamlessly, adapting their performance to the circumstances without faltering; but the learning of any skill relies on controlled practice and the development of underlying technique. It is not simply a matter of possessing ‘talent’ but comes as the result of a dedicated application to and practice in a chosen field, and the accumulation of experience.\n\nPeter Lloyd and Peter Scott found from protocol studies of architects and engineering designers that, for both, their approach appeared to be related to the amount and type of their previous experience. They found that more experienced designers used more of a conjecturing, solution-focused approach, more of what they called ‘generative’ (productive or abductive) reasoning, in contrast to the deductive reasoning employed more by less-experienced designers. They concluded that, in particular, ‘It is specific experience of the problem type that enables designers to adopt a conjectural approach to designing, that of framing or perceiving design problems in terms of relevant solutions’.\n\nClearly, part of the development of expertise lies in the accumulation of experience. Something that distinguishes experts from novices is that the experts have been exposed to a large number of examples of the problems and solutions that occur in their domain. It is a matter not just of copying from examples but of learning from them. A key competency of an expert is the mental ability to stand back from the specifics of the accumulated knowledge of precedents and form more abstract conceptualizations pertinent to their domain of expertise.\n\nDESIGN EXPERTISE\n\nExperts are believed to be able to store and access information in larger ‘chunks’ than novices and to recognize underlying principles, rather than focusing on the surface features of problems. This kind of behaviour classically occurs in chess playing, where chess masters are able to survey chess board positions and recognize patterns, and strategies for resolving them, whereas novices cannot see beyond the next one or two moves.\n\nBryan Lawson has drawn parallels between expertise in chess and design, and suggested that design masters also recognize patterns in problem situations and draw upon knowledge of precedents that they have abstracted into solution principles, or ‘schemata’ as Lawson calls them. A typical design schema for an architect might be a way of organizing internal space, such as around an atrium, or for an industrial designer might be grouping together different functional parts of a product. Lawson also suggested that, like chess masters, design masters have repertoires of ‘gambits’, or ways of proceeding, of entering into and opening up the problem situation. A typical gambit might be like that of Kenneth Grange (Chapter 3), starting a new project by ‘trying to sort out just the functionality, just the handling of it, and by-and-large out of that comes a direction’.\n\nIn order to develop skilled expertise it seems that a novice needs lots and lots of practice, guided by good teachers. The novice designer also needs exposure to good examples of expert work in the domain, and needs to learn to perceive and retain these examples in terms of their underlying schemata or organizing principles. Like learning a language, it is a matter of immersion and internalizing different levels of understanding and achievement.\n\nJust as design problems are ‘ill-defined’, so expert designers appear to be ‘ill-behaved’ problem solvers. Rather than the conventional behaviours of solvers of well-defined problems, designers are solution-focused, not problem-focused. This change of focus appears to be a feature of design expertise that develops with education and experience in designing. In particular, experience in a specific type of design domain enables designers to move quickly to formulating a problem frame and proposing a solution conjecture. Successful, experienced designers are repeatedly found to be pro- active in problem framing, actively imposing a view of the problem and directing the search for solution conjectures.\n\n167",

People who prefer the certainty of structured, well-defined problems are unlikely to appreciate the delight of being a designer.\n\nDesign intelligence\n\nWhat I have attempted to show throughout this book is that design ability is a multi-faceted skill. More than that, I have tried to show that there are particular, designerly ways of thinking and working that identify designing as equivalent with other highly regarded forms of cognitive skill. In fact, it seems possible to make a reasonable claim that design ability is a form of natural intelligence, one of the kind that the psychologist Howard Gardner identified. Gardner’s view is that there is not just one form of intelligence (as conventionally identified in forms of ‘intelligence tests’), but several, relatively autonomous human intellectual competencies, including linguistic, musical, mathematical, bodily and spatial intelligences. It seems reasonable that we might add design intelligence to those.\n\nThe understanding of design expertise suggests that a designer has a high level of intelligence used to plan, review, reflect on, adapt and, above all, create novel solutions. We have seen many aspects of this design intelligence in this book. For example, we have seen that good designers have a way of thinking that involves operating across different levels of detail in a project, from high-level systemic goals to low-level physical principles. Rather than solving merely ‘the problem as given’ they apply their intelligence to the wider context and suggest imaginative, apposite solutions that resolve conflicts and uncertainties. They have cognitive skills of problem framing, of gathering and structuring problem data and creating coherent patterns from the data that indicate ways of resolving the issues and suggest possible solution concepts. Design intelligence involves an intense, reflective interaction with models and representations of problems and solutions, and an ability to shift easily and rapidly\n\nDESIGN EXPERTISE\n\nbetween concrete representations and abstract thought, between doing and thinking. Good designers also apply constructive thinking not only in their individual work but also in collaboration in teamwork.\n\nThe designing brain\n\nThe nature of design intelligence becomes particularly and tragically highlighted in rare cases where it is impaired through neurological damage to the brain, such as through a stroke. One of these cases was reported by cognitive scientists Vinod Goel and Jordan Grafman, who studied an architect who had had a seizure, associated with a tumour in his right prefrontal cortex, a region at the front of the brain that is associated with high-level cognitive functions. Before his attack, this person had practised successfully as an architect but was unable to do so afterwards. In an experiment, Goel and Grafman compared his post-seizure design ability with that of a ‘control’ participant, another architect with similar education and design experience, on being given a relatively simple task of re-designing a laboratory space. The sequences of design sketches that the two architects produced are shown in Figures 8.6 and 8.7. Each began by making a survey drawing of the existing laboratory and its furniture. The healthy control participant then produced a coherent series of sketches, beginning with abstracted considerations of circulation and organization, then developing proposals and refining the preferred one. The neurological patient produced three separate, basic and incomplete proposals, finishing with a ‘final proposal’ that was still inadequate and incomplete.\n\nThe differences in the thinking processes of the two people become clear in graphs of the amount of time each devoted to different cognitive activities, as revealed by their ‘think aloud’ comments made during the experiments. These are shown in Figure 8.8. The control participant focused initially on problem structuring, with periodical returns to that throughout the process. He then moved on to preliminary design and to refinement and detailing. His graph clearly shows a complex but controlled pattern of activities, with overlap and rapid transitions between activities. In contrast, the neurologically damaged patient spent a huge amount of time on\n\n169\n\n170\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 8.6 The sequence of sketches for re-designing a laboratory made by the healthy control participant.

The experimenters reported that:\n\nThe patient understood the task and even observed that ‘this is a very simple problem’. His sophisticated architectural knowledge base was still intact and he used it quite skilfully during the problem structuring phase. However, the patient’s problem- solving behaviour differed from the control’s behaviour in the following ways: (1) he was unable to make the transition from problem structuring to problem solving; (2) as a result preliminary design did not start until two-thirds of the way into the session; (3) the preliminary design phase was minimal and erratic, consisting of three independently generated fragments; (4) there was no progression or lateral development of these fragments; (5) there was no carry-over of abstract information into the preliminary design or later phases; and (6) the patient did not make it to the\n\nDESIGN EXPERTISE\n\nFIGURE 8.7 The sequence of sketches made by the patient with neurological damage.

In short, the patient simply could not perform the relatively simple design task.\n\nSo in this unhappy case we can see exposed some of the considerable complexity that there is in normal design thinking, and evidence that the human brain has high-level cognitive functions that control or process activities that are essential aspects of design ability and that contribute to design thinking as a form of intelligence.\n\nNeurological studies of brain activity have identified specific areas of the brain as being active during design thinking. Katerina Alexiou and her colleagues conducted such a study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brains of volunteers who performed two similar tasks that were presented in different ways: one corresponding to a well-defined problem-solving task and the other corresponding to a typically ill-defined design task. The tasks were to plan a simple domestic room layout using a given set of\n\n171\n\n172\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nFIGURE 8.8 The pattern of design activities as recorded in the think- aloud comments of (a) the architect control participant and (b) the patient.

In the problem-solving version, the task was given as: Arrange the furniture so that: the bed is in the corner of the room, with its head to the west – the wardrobe is next to the door and next to the bed – the desk is under the window. In the designing version,\n\nDESIGN EXPERTISE\n\nit was given as: Arrange the furniture so that: the room is functional – the room is comfortable – it has at least a bed, a wardrobe and a desk. The problem-solving version is constrained and a correct solution can be formulated; the designing version is open-ended and qualitative and can have many satisfactory solutions. The results indicated that designing and problem-solving each involve cognitive functions associated with distinct brain networks and that designing draws on a more extensive network of brain areas in the right prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is involved in complex cognitive behaviours including planning and decision making.\n\nThe two hemispheres of the brain, right and left, have different cognitive specialisms. The neural networks specific to designing appear to lie more within the right rather than the left hemisphere of the brain. Neuroscience studies tend to confirm that the right hemisphere is more specialized in spatial and constructional tasks, in aesthetic perception and emotions. The left hemisphere is more specialized in language abilities and verbal reasoning. Damage to the left hemisphere often results in the loss of some speech functions, whereas damage to the right hemisphere, as we have seen, can result, amongst other things, in the loss of design ability.\n\nA view of design thinking as a form of intelligence does not necessarily mean that some people ‘have it’ and some people do not. Design ability is something that everyone has, to some extent, because it is embedded in our brains as a natural cognitive function. Although everyone can design, like other forms of intelligence and ability design intelligence may be possessed, or may be manifested in performance, at higher levels by some people than by others. And like other forms of intelligence and ability, design intelligence is not simply a given ‘talent’ or ‘gift’ but can be trained and developed. Otherwise, what would be the point of having design schools?\n\nSummary\n\nResults from studies of expertise in creative domains such as design do not always match with results from standard studies of expertise; expert designers exhibit different strategies from conventional problem-solving. The development of expertise happens over\n\n173\n\n174\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\ntime as a person learns and matures, and usually passes through different levels of attainment. Moving from one level to another is not necessarily a steady progression: the changes in level involve internalizing different ways of working. Developing greater expertise generally means developing a broader and more complex understanding of goals, which is related to the amount and type of previous experience. Typically, experienced designers traverse across a broad range of activities throughout the whole design process. Achieving skilled patterns of design behaviour can be assisted through education and guided practice. An expert designer can be regarded as having a high level of a particular design intelligence. As with other cognitive abilities, aspects of design cognition are located in specific areas of the brain and can be impaired through neurological damage to the brain.\n\nSources\n\nFull citations are given in the References.\n\nSaeema Ahmed, et al.: Understanding the differences between\n\nhow novice and experienced designers approach design tasks, Research in Engineering Design.\n\nKaterina Alexiou, et al.: Exploring the neurological basis of design\n\ncognition using brain imaging, Design Studies.\n\nCynthia Atman: Designing Design Learning and Design timelines,\n\nDesign Studies.\n\nCynthia Atman, et al.: Comparing freshman and senior engineering\n\ndesign processes, Design Studies.

Abductive reasoning leads to a plausible or satisfactory, but not certain, conclusion from a set of observations or problematic situation. It provides a reasonable and defensible suggestion that something may be, but not that it definitely is or must be, an appropriate conclusion. It is the rhetorical, persuasive logic of design. See pages 11, 26–7.\n\nco-evolution Both the understanding of the problematic situation and proposals for its solution co-evolve during the process of designing. Designers look for structures within the problem space that prompt complementary structures within the solution space. Iteration between the two search spaces of problem and solution proceeds in a process of co-evolution, progressively refining together both the formulation of the problem and a matching proposal for its solution. See pages 92–5.\n\nemergence Emergence occurs in designing when patterns or properties that were not explicitly included or intended are perceived in a solution conjecture. This perception can then lead to improving or developing the solution. The recognition of emergent solution features can also lead to reconsidering the problem, the co-emergence of new issues or the re-definition of requirements and the re-interpretation of the problem. See pages 12, 89.\n\nfixation A weakness in design behaviour can occur where details of known previous design solutions are inappropriately, and perhaps unconsciously, carried over into new solutions. This fixation effect can lead to inhibiting creative thought and to restricting the search space for appropriate solutions. See pages 67–70.\n\nframing Framing is a key aspect of design expertise and the central feature of reflective practice. It involves forming a viewpoint that structures the loose complexity of a problematic situation and thereby establishes a constructive coherence within the problem space. The framed viewpoint provides a perspective that also sets some boundaries on the solution space and promotes and guides the search for solution conjectures. See pages 24, 88–91.\n\nmetacognition Cognition, commonly referred to as ‘thinking’, includes\n\nmany aspects of intellectual functioning such as perception, reasoning and problem-solving. Metacognition is a higher level of\n\n178\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nawareness of one’s own thought processes and an understanding of the patterns behind them: thinking about thinking or knowing about knowing. Designers use metacognition when they reflect on their ways of acting and thinking during a design process, assess their progress and choose a particular strategy or procedure to follow. See page 142.\n\nopportunism An apparent weakness in design behaviour has been\n\ntermed opportunistic behaviour. This is observed as deviations from a structured plan or methodical process into the pursuit of issues or partial solutions that catch the designer’s attention, or as ‘drifting’ through a sequence of partial solution developments. The cognitive cost of maintaining a very broad focus may be a reason for these behaviours. It may also be a consequence of working with the ill-structuredness of design problems and should not necessarily be equated with poor design behaviour but accepted as a natural characteristic of experienced design behaviour. See pages 116, 145–6.\n\nreflective practice The theory of reflective practice proposes a model\n\nof skilled professional activity around processes of naming, framing, moving and reflecting, which iteratively move towards problem understanding and solution development. Naming identifies things of interest; framing guides subsequent activity by providing a way to perceive and shape the problem; moves generate potential solutions suggested by the frame; reflecting on the appropriateness and contextual implications of the moves assesses their validity and/or identifies more things of interest. See pages 21–2, 89.\n\nrepresentations Tentative design solution conjectures are expressed in various representations, including not only sketches and drawings but also physical prototypes and computer models. They support the uncertain, exploratory nature of conceptual design activity by externalizing and facilitating design cognition, and they store and communicate the designer’s thinking. Representations aid the generation and evaluation of solution concepts, the identification of what needs to be known about a developing concept and the recognition of emergent features and properties.

      "content": "Preface\n\nDesign thinking is the core creative process for any designer; this\n\nbook explores and explains this apparently mysterious design ability. This new edition is a completely revised, updated and extended version of a classic text.\n\nFocusing on what designers actually do when they are designing, the book is structured around a series of in-depth case studies of the work of outstanding and expert designers, interwoven and developed with commentary and comparison. The coverage reflects the breadth of design from architecture to engineering, from consumer products to communications and from individual designing to teamwork and collaborative designing. The scale of designing ranges from Formula One racing cars to city commuting cars, locomotives to bicycles, sewing machines to litter bins and lemon squeezers. The book is based on evidence from observation and investigation of design practice, providing insights into and understanding of design thinking, and the development of design ability from novice to expert.\n\nDesign Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work offers an overview from one of design’s most experienced and influential scholars. This book goes to the heart of what it means to think and work as a designer. It is an ideal guide for anyone who wants to become a designer or to know how good designers work in the field of contemporary design.",

Victor Scheinman generously volunteered to participate in the experiment reported in Chapter 5, as did the anonymous designers from IDEO, ‘Ivan’, ‘John’ and ‘Kerry’, reported in Chapter 6, all providing their time and talent free of charge and allowing their design activity to be observed, recorded and analysed. My colleagues at the Delft University of Technology, Kees Dorst and Henri Christiaans, provided the initiative and the hard work in the design and conduct of the experiments. The facilities for the experiments were provided by the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, with the considerable help of Steve Harrison and Scott Minneman. My wife, Anita Clayburn Cross, also contributed considerably to analysing the experiments and to discussions with Gordon and Kenneth, as well as to my general well-being throughout.",

The latter formulation has been attractive within businesses that have realized the financial and competitive benefits of design-led technology. It has also been applied in a diversity of other fields, such as in education and more broadly in social innovation. This wider recognition of the relevance and value of design thinking is welcome. However, whilst the wider formulation draws upon some aspects of design practice, such as creative thinking, it is often applied through a simplified version of design methods adapted by and for consultants who mainly do not work within the design domain. These two different formulations and applications have led to some confusion because they both use the term ‘design thinking’. This book follows the original formulation of design thinking, which grew from the study of design processes, design reasoning and design cognition.\n\nEvery experienced designer has learned, practised and honed their designerly ways of knowing, acting and thinking. Designers know about the technical aspects of their professions, about the materials and manufacturing processes of their field, about the habits and preferences of the users of their products and systems, about organizing and managing projects and teams, and about precedents and exemplars within their field. Designers act in ways that are creative but constrained by the problem requirements set by their clients, guided by the goals and abilities of the potential users of their products and systems, and facilitated and enhanced by their own",

Designers think strategically within and around the problems they are given and the solutions they are creating, developing together both the problem and the possibilities for its solution to reach a satisfactory, matching resolution of both, using patterns and types of constructive reasoning. These designerly ways of knowing, acting and thinking are not something that can be gained adequately just from a seminar, a one-day workshop or even a four-day ‘bootcamp’ in design thinking – or just reading a book.\n\nThis book is about design thinking in terms of the practical, strategical and cognitive skills actually used by designers in creating proposals for new products and systems. This is not a methods or ‘how-to’ book but a book that provides explanation, commentary and advice, rather than instruction (although becoming more self-aware of one’s thinking and acting can help in the development of skills and abilities). It is a book that reveals what has been learned from research into many different aspects of designerly thinking and is intended to sit within that culture of research and education. Its primary purpose is expressed in its subtitle: understanding how designers think and work.\n\nIn writing this book, my goal has been to help anyone interested in design to develop their understanding of how designers think and work. Anyone so interested might well be a design student, teacher or researcher, perhaps a practising designer who still finds their own processes mysterious or difficult, other professionals who want to develop their understanding of design thinking or indeed anyone interested in the mysteries of designing, because anyone can be a designer, even in everyday activities. The focus of the book is on revealing what designers do during the activity of designing and on building an appreciation of the nature of design ability and expertise. Readers should gain from the book some insight into what it means to be a designer, how designers employ their practical, strategical and cognitive skills, both individually and collaboratively, and what is known about the nature of design ability and its development from novice student to expert professional.\n\nMy own background includes architectural and industrial design, but primarily I am a design educator and researcher with an interest in the common aspects of designing that recur across different",

My approach to trying to understand how designers think and work is research-based: I look for and report evidence that comes from observation, experiment, analysis and reflection. My aim is to reveal and articulate the apparently mysterious (and sometimes mystified) cognitive and creative abilities of designers, that are common across many design fields.\n\nI take an interdisciplinary approach to design, so throughout the book observations are made, and comparisons are drawn, across various professional fields such as architectural, product, engineering and automotive design. Other professional design fields, such as software and interaction design, furniture design and communication design, are also mentioned. But because I take a research-based approach to understanding design thinking, some fields get less coverage in the book simply because less research has been conducted in them (or I am less aware of it). Nevertheless, I believe that many aspects of design thinking are common across the different fields of application, and so I trust that my observations and comments will have some validity across them all.\n\nThe design of this book\n\nJust about everything that we have around us has been designed. Anything that isn’t a genuine, untouched-by-human-hands piece of nature has been designed by someone, including this book. Many people have been involved in the design of the book, including editors, typesetters and graphic designers, and the external reviewers. I am responsible for the choice of the words and illustrations, the selection and presentation of the evidence and the construction of the arguments, but I have also designed the overall structure of the book in a way that I hope helps the reader to use it and navigate through it.\n\nThe structure is based upon a repeated pattern of double case studies followed by a commentary that summarizes and discusses what can be learned from the case studies in more general terms, and brings in and builds relationships with a wider field of literature in studies of design thinking. The focus of the first pair of case studies and the following discussion is more on ‘how designers think’ and\n\n3",

These case studies are based on my own research; each of them is treated in depth and forms a complete chapter. They provide a focused resource for the study of high-quality, expert design thinking. The commentary and overview chapters that follow them provide discussion and reflection that I hope lead the reader into a broader and deeper understanding of the nature of design thinking. These central elements of case studies plus discussion are bounded by chapters at the beginning and the end of the book on design ability and design expertise.\n\nThe first two case studies (Chapters 2 and 3) are interview- based and draw upon the work of highly successful, outstanding contemporary designers: one an automotive designer, Gordon Murray, and the other an industrial designer, Kenneth Grange. The other two case studies (Chapters 5 and 6) are experiment-based research studies, featuring an expert engineering designer, Victor Scheinman, and a team of experienced product designers from the IDEO design consultancy. Both Victor and the IDEO team were asked to tackle the same small design project in a recorded, laboratory-like situation. In addition to observations to be made, and lessons to be drawn from these four particular case studies, I draw widely upon the research literature in design thinking in order to amplify and extend from the particular to the general in the four other chapters. Each of those chapters concludes with a short summary of its main points and the sources from which they are drawn.

To design things is normal for human beings and something not always regarded as needing special abilities. Design ability has often been a collective or shared ability, and it is only in fairly recent history that the ability to design has become regarded as a kind of special competence.\n\nAlthough there is so much design activity going on in the world, the ways in which people design were rather poorly understood for rather a long time. Design ability has been regarded as something that perhaps many people possess to some degree, but only a few people have a particularly strong design talent or ‘gift’. Of course, we do know that some people are better designers than others. Ever since the emergence of designers as professional specialists, it has appeared that some people have a design ability that is more highly developed than other people – either through some genetic endowment or through social and educational development.",

The studies have ranged from student designers to experienced, expert and outstanding designers. The kinds of methods used in these studies have included interviews (asking designers about what they do), analytical case studies (deconstructing what designers do), real-world and laboratory-style studies (watching what designers do), and reflection and theorizing (thinking about what designers do). All of these methods have helped to develop an understanding of how designers think and work.\n\nA variety of research methods has been required because to understand design ability it is necessary to approach it slightly obliquely. Like all kinds of sophisticated cognitive abilities, it is impossible to approach it directly, or bluntly. Designers themselves are often not very good at explaining how they design. When designers – especially skilled, successful designers – talk spontaneously about what they do, they talk almost exclusively about the outcomes, not the activities. They talk about the products of their designing rather than the process. This is a common feature of experts in any field. Their enthusiasm lies in evaluating what they produce, rather than in analysing how they produce it.\n\nSometimes, some designers can even seem to be wilfully obscure about how they work and where their ideas come from. The renowned French designer Philippe Starck is known to suggest that design ideas seem to come to him quite quickly and spontaneously, as if from nowhere. For example, of the design of his iconic lemon squeezer for the Italian kitchenware manufacturer Alessi, Starck has said that, in a restaurant, ‘this vision of a squid-like lemon squeezer came upon me’. And so, just like that, Juicy Salif, the lemon squeezer (Figure 1.1), was conceived, went into production and on to become a",

Perhaps it seems arrogant for the architect Denys Lasdun to have claimed that ‘Our job is to give the client . . . not what he wants, but what he never dreamed he wanted’. But I think that we should try to see through the apparent arrogance in this statement, to the underlying truth that their clients do want designers to transcend the obvious and the mundane, and to produce proposals that are exciting and attractive as well as practical. What this means is that designing is not a search for the optimum solution to the given problem, but that it is a creative, exploratory process. The creative designer interprets the design brief not as a specification for a solution but as a starting point for a journey of exploration; the designer sets off to explore, to discover something new, rather than to reach somewhere already known or to return with yet another example of the already familiar.\n\n9",

Expert designers exercise very developed forms of certain tacit, deep-seated cognitive skills. But, as we shall see later, it is possible to unravel even Philippe Starck’s visionary Juicy Salif moment into a much less mysterious explanation of his design process.\n\nAsking designers about what they do\n\nThe spontaneous comments of designers themselves about designing can seem obscure, but it is possible to gain some insights by interviewing them more carefully and interpreting the implications of their responses. Asking designers about what they do is perhaps the simplest and most direct form of inquiry into design ability, although this technique has not in fact been practised extensively.\n\nRobert Davies interviewed members of the UK-based ‘Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry’. This is an elite body of designers, affiliated to the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce or the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) as it is more conveniently known. Royal Designers for Industry (RDIs) are selected for the honour of appointment to the Faculty on the basis of their outstanding achievements in design. So choosing RDIs for interview is one way of ensuring that you are interviewing eminent designers with a record of achievement and accomplishment; that they do indeed possess and use a high level of design ability. At the time Davies conducted his interviews there were sixty-eight RDIs, ranging over professions such as graphic design, product design, furniture design, textile design, fashion design, engineering design, automotive design and interior design. He interviewed thirty-five of these, conducting the interviews informally at their own homes or places of work but recording the discussions.\n\nDavies was especially interested in the creative aspects of design ability. His informal interviews tended to range widely over many aspects of the design process, and on what seems to make some people ‘creative’. One theme that recurred in their responses was the designers’ reliance on what they regarded as ‘intuition’. For example, the architect and industrial designer Jack Howe said, ‘I",

      "content": "DESIGN ABILITY\n\nbelieve in intuition. I think that’s the difference between a designer and an engineer . . . I make a distinction between engineers and engineering designers . . . An engineering designer is just as creative as any other sort of designer.’ The product designer Richard Stevens made a rather similar comment about the difference between engineering and designing: ‘A lot of engineering design is intuitive, based on subjective thinking. But an engineer is unhappy doing this. An engineer wants to test; test and measure. He’s been brought up this way and he’s unhappy if he can’t prove something. Whereas an industrial designer is entirely happy making judgements which are intuitive.’\n\nWhat these designers are saying is that they find some aspects of their work appear to them to be natural, perhaps almost unconscious, ways of thinking, and they find that some other types of people (notably, the engineers with whom they come into contact in the course of their work) are uncomfortable with this way of thinking. They believe that this ‘intuitive’ way of thinking may be something that they inherently possess, or it may be something that they developed through their education. It may also be that they are overlooking the considerable experience that they have gathered, and in fact their ‘intuitive’ responses may be derived from these large pools of experience, and from prior learning gained from making appropriate, and inappropriate, responses in certain situations.\n\nHowever, ‘intuitive’ thinking might be right in a more profound sense, meaning that it is not based upon conventional forms of logical reasoning. The concept of ‘intuition’ may be a convenient, shorthand word for what really happens in design thinking. The more useful concept that has been used by design researchers in explaining the reasoning processes of designers is that design thinking is abductive: a type of reasoning different from the more familiar concepts of inductive and deductive reasoning, but which is the necessary reasoning or logic of design. It is this particular logic of design that provides the means to shift and transfer thought between the required purpose of some activity and appropriate forms for an object to satisfy that purpose. We will explore this logic of design later.\n\nAnother theme that arose from Davies’s interviews with these leading designers is related to this tricky relationship between the\n\n11",

Designers recognize that problems and solutions in design are closely interwoven, that ‘the solution’ is not always a straightforward answer to ‘the problem’. A solution may be something that not only the client but also the designer ‘never dreamed he wanted’. For example, commenting on one of his more creative designs, the furniture designer Geoffrey Harcourt said, ‘As a matter of fact, the solution that I came up with wasn’t a solution to the problem at all. I never saw it as that . . . But when the chair was actually put together, in a way it quite well solved the problem, but from a completely different angle, a completely different point of view.’ This ‘point of view’ comment suggests something of the perceptual aspect of design thinking – like seeing the vase rather than the faces, in the well-known ambiguous figure (Figure 1.2a). It implies that designing utilizes aspects of emergence; relevant features emerge in tentative solution concepts and can be recognized as having properties that suggest how the developing solution concept might be matched to the also developing problem concept. Emergent properties are those that are perceived or recognized in a partial or proto-solution that were not consciously included or intended. In a sketch, for example, an emergent aspect is something that was not drawn as itself but which can be seen in the overlaps or relationships between the drawn components (Figure 1.2b). In the process of designing, the problem and the solution develop together.\n\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Ambiguity – vase or faces?

      "content": "DESIGN ABILITY\n\nGiven the complex nature of design activity, therefore, it hardly seems surprising that the structural engineering designer Ted Happold suggested to Davies that ‘I really have, perhaps, one real talent, which is that I don’t mind at all living in the area of total uncertainty.’ Happold certainly needed this talent, as a leading member of the structural design team for some of the most challenging buildings in the world, such as the Sydney Opera House and the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and in his own engineering design work in lightweight structures. The uncertainty of design is both the frustration and the joy that designers get from their activity; they have learned to live with the fact that design proposals may remain ambiguous and uncertain until quite late in the process. Designers will generate early tentative solutions, but also leave many options open for as long as possible; they are prepared to regard solution concepts as temporarily imprecise and often inconclusive.\n\nAnother common theme from Davies’s interviews is that designers need to use sketches, drawings and models of all kinds as a way of exploring problem and solution together, and of making some progress when faced with the complexity of design. For example, Jack Howe said that, when uncertain how to proceed, ‘I draw something. Even if it’s “potty” I draw it. The act of drawing seems to clarify my thoughts.’ He is saying that, when faced with a blank sheet of paper, he can at least draw something that may at first seem silly or inappropriate, but which provides a starting point to which he can respond; if it doesn’t seem right, why doesn’t it? Designing, it seems, is difficult to conduct by purely internal mental processes; the designer needs to interact with external representations. The activity of sketching, drawing or modelling provides some of the circumstances by which designers put themselves into the design situation and engage with the exploration of both the problem and its solution. There is a cognitive limit to the amount of complexity that can be handled internally; sketching provides a temporary, external store for tentative ideas and supports the ‘dialogue’ that the designer has between problem and solution.\n\nMany aspects of design ability that emerge from Davies’s study are also reflected in another set of interviews with highly successful designers, conducted by Bryan Lawson, who interviewed a number of internationally leading architects. The importance of drawing\n\n13",

      "content": "14\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nand sketching within the design process is one thing especially emphasized by these architects. For example, the British architect Richard MacCormac said, ‘Whenever we have a design session or a crit review session in the office I cannot say anything until I’ve got a pencil in my hand . . . I feel the pencil to be my spokesman, as it were . . . I haven’t got an imagination that can tell me what I’ve got without drawing it . . . I use drawing as a process of criticism and discovery.’ Here, MacCormac is saying that he uses drawing both as a means of imaging, imagining or discovering something that he cannot construct just in his mind and as a means of communicating with others – the pencil is his ‘spokesman’, communicating by means of what he draws. Note that the ‘spokesman’ is not only communicator but also critic and discoverer, which reinforces just how cognitively important the act of sketching is to the designer.\n\nDesigners learn to think through this sketch-like form, in which the abstract patterns of client and user requirements are turned into the concrete patterns of an actual object. It is like learning another form of language, a kind of code which transforms ‘thoughts’ into ‘words’. Design thinking is practised and embodied in this language and its codes. Obtaining and using this graphic ‘language’ has been termed graphicacy, equivalent to obtaining and using numeracy and literacy.\n\nAlso as in the study by Davies, Lawson identified from his interviews something of the complex relationship in design between problem and solution. Richard MacCormac spoke of defining the problem through attempting solutions: ‘Issues which are the stuff of the thing often only come out when you try and produce a scheme, and therefore the design process defines objectives in a way in which the brief could never do.’ In fact, when I interviewed Richard MacCormac, he told me: ‘I don’t think you can design anything just by absorbing information and then hoping to synthesise it into a solution. What you need to know about the problem only becomes apparent as you’re trying to solve it.’ This confirms a view that the design brief is not a specification for a solution but the starting point for an exploration. Like Denys Lasdun saying that the architect’s job is to give the client something other than ‘what he wants’, Richard MacCormac told Lawson, ‘Often in competitions the winning scheme is the one that tells the client something that they never knew before . . . something that is terribly important to them and was not in",

As Lawson commented, ‘Although we tend to admire designers for their solutions, it is often their ability to find the right problems which distinguishes good from adequate or poor design.’\n\nLawson also suggested that good designers are good at coping with uncertainty. Several of his interviewed architects spoke of carrying on ‘parallel processes’ of cognition relevant to the same design job at the same time. Lawson found a strong example of what he called such ‘parallel lines of thought’ in the American architect Robert Venturi’s description of working on his design for the Sainsbury Wing extension to the National Gallery in London. One particular line of thought concerned ideas for relating the circulation system in the new building to that in the older part (issues of the plan and of floor levels), whilst another was for relating together the external appearances of the new and old parts (issues of the façade and of architectural styles). Lawson suggests that Venturi kept these two sets of ideas in progress, both equally important to his design thinking, before resolving them into a single solution. ‘The problem for the designer’, Lawson commented, ‘is when the attempt should be made to reconcile all the ideas, or lines of thought, which are developing . . . what seems clear is that a degree of bravery is required to allow these lines of thought to remain parallel rather longer than might seem reasonable to the inexperienced designer.’ Coping with uncertainty, as Ted Happold emphasized, seems to be a key factor in design ability.\n\nOne way to cope with uncertainty is to try to impose order. Jane Darke also interviewed a number of successful architects and noticed how they sought to impose order on the problems they faced. Some brought to the problem a personal set of guiding principles that offered starting points, some sought to find starting points in the particularities of the site on which they were to build. Darke observed how these starting points enabled the designers to make the problem more manageable, to provide a narrower focus within which they could work. The designers imposed a limited set of objectives, or an idea about the building form, as a ‘primary generator’, as Darke called it, a means of instantiating a solution concept. This seems to be a necessary part of the design process, because a solution concept\n\n15",

However, what designers actually do in the process of designing can to some extent be observed in the traces that they leave – their sketches, drawings and notes. So trying to understand what has gone on in that process of sketching and thinking could give us some insights into the core nature of designing. In examining and deconstructing their series of tentative drawn outputs we see, for instance, how sketching helps the designer to consider many aspects at once – we see plans, elevations, details, views, all being drawn together and thus all being thought about, reasoned about, all together. Comments and calculations are also often made alongside representations of the emerging design, as the designer generates alternative versions, considers and criticizes them and continues the voyage of exploration.\n\nI suggested before that it is possible to unravel even Philippe Starck’s mystical account of the conception of his Juicy Salif lemon squeezer into a much less mysterious explanation. To do this, I am drawing upon an exercise in deconstructing this particular design act by Peter Lloyd and Dirk Snelders, in which they utilized the evidence of Starck’s very first design sketches for it, what (little) he has said about the conception of the lemon squeezer and what he has said about himself and his interests in various interviews.\n\nThe Alessi company had started a new series of products designed by internationally famous designers, including kettles and coffee pots by architects Michael Graves and Aldo Rossi, and cutlery and condiment sets by industrial designers Richard Sapper and Ettore Sottsass, when they invited Philippe Starck to offer a new product in this ‘designer’ series, a lemon squeezer. Philippe went to Italy to visit Alessi and discuss the project. He then took a short break on the small island of Capraia, just off the Tuscan coast, and went to dine in",

He was obviously already thinking about the lemon squeezer project, because, as he waited for his food, he began to sketch on the paper place mat. At first, the sketches were just rough images of a fairly conventional form of lemon squeezer (see the centre-right area of the place mat, Figure 1.3), but then something happened to inspire a leap to making sketches of something quite different – his antipasto plate of baby squid had arrived, and Starck began to get his ‘vision of a squid-like lemon squeezer’. His sketches on the place mat now became images of strange forms with big bodies and long legs, and eventually (bottom-left in Figure 1.3) something emerged that is now recognizable as the Juicy Salif concept. The spiral body fluting for the lemon juice to flow down into a receptacle underneath was used in the first prototype but was modified to vertical fluting in the production version.\n\nLloyd and Snelders recount what probably went on in this quick process of creative sketching and thinking, as Starck drew for inspiration not only on the squid but also on his boyhood interests in sci-fi comics and spaceship imagery. ‘First he tries to make a conventional lemon squeezer out of a squid, but then he realises that\n\nFIGURE 1.3 Philippe Starck’s design sketches for the lemon squeezer on the restaurant place mat.

It seems to be dragging, injured almost.’ Here, one might interject, Starck seems to be using his pencil, like Richard MacCormac, in a process of discovery and invention.\n\nHe keeps going, eating while he sketches. His sketches abstractly remind him of the old comics he used to read . . . Things begin to gel in his mind, and from the dragging creature emerges a lighter, three-legged form . . . He likes the form, it’s ‘working’ . . . The next morning he phones Alessi, ‘I’ve got a lemon squeezer for you’, he teases. Of course there are a few details to work out, exact dimensions, what material to use, how to get the juice out of the lemon efficiently. But . . . the main problem is solved.\n\nSo we see that the concept for the strange new type of lemon squeezer did not leap fully formed into Philippe Starck’s mind but emerged, albeit rather quickly, in a process of sketching inspired by seeing a squid shape as a potential source of form and driven by recall of other imagery. This other imagery comes from some of Philippe’s other interests, including aircraft design (his father’s occupation), space rockets, science fiction and comic strips. Lloyd and Snelders suggest that Philippe has retained a kind of juvenile enthusiasm for futuristic imagery of space rockets and alien invaders.\n\nIn deconstructing Philippe Starck’s design activity from his sketches, Lloyd and Snelders implied that the ‘squid-like’ concept was not an inexplicable flash of inspiration from nowhere, but that it arose rather more prosaically by applying an analogy (the form of a squid) to the problem that was on Philippe’s mind (a novel form for a lemon squeezer). This kind of analogy-making is often proposed as a means of encouraging creative thinking. What was particularly striking in this case was Starck’s ability to make such a leap of imagination from ‘squid’ to ‘lemon squeezer’. Thereafter, Lloyd and Snelders suggested, Philippe, in developing the concept, was doing what many designers do, which is to draw upon a repertoire of precedents, knowledge of other similar objects, remembered images and recollections; in this case perhaps images of tripodic alien creatures from science fiction, that helped him to give a more coherent form to the concept. This deconstruction of Philippe Starck’s design process is represented in Figure 1.4.",

Such studies not only report on what was observed to happen but also try to add another layer of explanation of the nature of designing. Larry Bucciarelli made a series of extensive studies of engineering design projects in three different companies. Large projects demand an important aspect of design ability, that of reconciling the variety of interests – technical, financial, social, aesthetic and so on – that inevitably have to coalesce around a major project. In these cases, designing becomes not just a personal, cognitive process, but a collaborative, social process. The main conclusion that Bucciarelli stressed is how even engineering design, traditionally seen as a\n\n19",

His thesis is that ‘the process of designing is a process of achieving consensus among participants with different “interests” in the design, and that those different interests are not reconcilable in object-world terms . . . The process is necessarily social and requires the participants to negotiate their differences and construct meaning through direct, and preferably face-to-face, exchange’. The social nature of teamwork, he suggested, results in acknowledging the inevitability of uncertainty and ambiguity, even within the process of engineering design. ‘Ambiguity is essential to design process, allowing participants the freedom to manoeuvre independently within object worlds and providing room for the recasting of meaning in the negotiations with others.’\n\nPeter Rowe made a set of observations of architects at work. These studies were of the design processes of three major buildings in American cities, designed by leading architects. Rowe noticed in all three studies that the architects’ attention switched regularly between solution concepts and problem exploration – between developing ideas for building form and investigating the implications of those ideas in terms of the design brief and technical feasibility. He characterized the progress of the design activity as ‘episodic’ or as a kind of ‘series of related skirmishes with various aspects of the problem at hand’. This episodic structure was manifest in a number of ways:\n\nFirst, there is the ‘to and fro’ movement between areas of concern . . . a movement back and forth between exploration of architectural form and evaluation of programme [brief], structure, and other technical issues. Second, there seem to be periods of unfettered speculation, followed by more sober and contemplative episodes during which the designer ‘takes stock of the situation’. Third, each episode seems to have a particular orientation that preoccupies the designer. We might say that the organising principles involved in each episode take on a life of their own, as the designer becomes absorbed in exploring the possibilities that they promise.",

But Rowe made a criticism of this way of proceeding; it seemed to him to be unnecessarily chancy, and inefficient. ‘These episodes’, he commented, ‘such as the various massing exercises with building volumes, often became very speculative as the designer “pressed on”, as it were, when information from another quarter might have resolved the problem at hand more economically. Such situations often subsequently gave rise to a certain amount of backtracking, as the designer retrenched to what seemed a more advantageous position.’ It is as though the designer adopts a blinkered approach, overly focused on a particular solution concept, and doggedly ‘pressing on’ when a more considered and reflective approach, and consideration of alternative solution concepts, might save time and effort in the long run. Why should experienced designers behave in this apparently restricted way? It could be that they have to invest significant cognitive effort in generating these concepts and so they are reluctant to let go of them.\n\nThe most influential study of a designer at work has been that by Donald Schön. The influence of the study is largely due to it being set within Schön’s broader series of studies of professional practice (ranging from psychotherapy to management) that he used to establish his theory of reflective practice, or ‘how professionals think in action’. The study has also been influential because Schön’s analysis of what he observed is acute and sensitive; designers and design researchers (those with personal design experience) recognize the veracity of the analysis. What is surprising is that such an influential study is based on just one, partial example of design activity – and even that is not a ‘real’ design example but is taken from observing an experienced designer tutor a student in a university architectural design studio.\n\nSchön established his theory of reflective practice as a counter to a more prevalent theory of technical rationality or the constrained application of scientific theory and technique to practical problems. He was seeking a new understanding that would help explain and account for how competent practitioners actually engage with their\n\n21",

In his analysis of the case studies that provided the foundations for his theory, he began with the assumption that ‘competent practitioners usually know more than they can say. They exhibit a kind of knowing-in-practice, most of which is tacit’. He identified a cognitive process of reflection-in-action as the intelligence that guides ‘intuitive’ behaviour in practical contexts of thinking and acting – something like ‘thinking on your feet’. At the heart of reflection-in-action is the ‘frame experiment’ in which the practitioner frames, or poses a way of seeing the problematic situation at hand, or finds a way into the problem, something like Jane Darke’s ‘primary generator’.\n\n‘a reflective conversation with the situation’, an interactive process based on posing a problem frame and exploring its implications in ‘moves’ that investigate the emerging solution possibilities. A designer, he argued, is faced with a situation of complexity.\n\nAccording to Schön, designing proceeds as\n\nBecause of this complexity, the designer’s moves tend, happily or unhappily, to produce consequences other than those intended. When this happens, the designer may take account of the unintended changes he has made in the situation by forming new appreciations and understandings and by making new moves. He shapes the situation, in accordance with his initial appreciation of it, the situation ‘talks back’, and he responds to the situation’s back-talk.\n\nThe design example that Schön analysed was that of a tutor, ‘Quist’, an experienced architect, helping a student, ‘Petra’, with her problem of designing a school on a sloping site. Because Quist has to explain his own thinking to Petra, his words, and the sketches he makes at the same time, give an insight into his cognitive processes, his reflection-in-action. The talking (i.e. the thinking) and the drawing go on in parallel, as other designers have said.\n\nPetra is ‘stuck’ in the early part of her design process: she has drawn a series of connected, L-shaped classroom blocks, but she has a problem fitting them to the site. ‘I’ve tried to butt the shape of the building into the contours of the land there – but the shape doesn’t",

Quist suggests that she stops trying to stick so closely to the site’s contours, and instead that she should seek to impose her building geometry onto the site. ‘You should begin with a discipline’, he says, ‘even if it is arbitrary . . . you can always break it open later.’ Quist starts to sketch in plan and section, exploring the implications of the ‘discipline’ of form that he is now imposing on the site. As he explores, he begins to find some of those ‘new appreciations and understandings’ in the design. With his more aggressive approach to the site, he sees how, in section, across the fall of the site,\n\nWe get a total differential potential here from one end of the classroom to the far end of the other. There is fifteen feet max, right – so we could have as much as five-foot intervals, which for a kid is maximum height, right? The section through here could be one of nooks in here and the differentiation between this unit and this would be at two levels.\n\nThe idea of ‘kid-height nooks’ is something that Quist discovers as a potential in his solution concept, not something that was in the design brief; it is an emergent property of his designing. In Schön’s terms, it is an ‘unintended change’ in the situation, which Quist interprets as a positive indicator of the appropriateness of the problem frame that he has set up. A little later, as he continues designing, other positive aspects are spotted and reinforced in the emerging design – and even the qualities of the site come back into play, as here: ‘Let the land generate some sub-ideas here, which could be very nice. Maybe the cafeteria needn’t be such a formal function – maybe it could come into here to get summer sun here and winter here.’\n\nOne thing Quist demonstrates is that he has the confidence to ask ‘what if?’ What if we carve the L-shaped blocks more deeply into the site? What if we work with a system of five-feet height intervals? What if we create a gallery-level circulation space? These ‘what if’ conjectures are the ‘moves’ that Schön identified:\n\nEach has implications binding on later moves. And each creates new problems to be described and solved. Quist designs by spinning out a web of moves, consequences, implications, appreciations,\n\n23",

As Quist reflects on the unexpected consequences and implications of his moves, he listens to the situation’s back-talk, forming new appreciations which guide his further moves.\n\nAs designing proceeds, the sketches become a record of the moves and their implications. Many things remain tentative, but some are selected as positive outcomes of the ‘what if?’ conjectures and are given temporary identities as features to be retained. Schön suggested that these are choice-points within the process.\n\nAs he reflects-in-action on the situation created by his earlier moves, the designer must consider not only the present choice but the tree of further choices to which it leads, each of which has different meanings in relation to the systems of implications set up by earlier moves. Quist’s virtuosity lies in his ability to string out design webs of great complexity. But even he cannot hold in mind an indefinitely expanding web. At some point, he must move from a ‘what if?’ to a decision which then becomes a design node with binding implications for further moves. Thus there is a continually evolving system of implications within which the designer reflects-in-action.\n\nWhat we gain from Schön’s analysis is a clear account of a typical, fast moving, ‘thinking on your feet’, live example of designing. The initial problematic situation is ‘framed’ by the designer. Quist’s framing adopts the given of Petra’s starting point of a series of linked L-shaped blocks (he is tutoring her in how to develop her solution idea, not starting from scratch with his own idea) and poses the implicit question, ‘How can we make these blocks fit into the sloping site in a coherent way?’ He works through a series of thinking-actions of moving-seeing-moving; that is, of posing a ‘what if?’ move, looking at what results (in his sketches), reflecting on the consequences (good or bad), and making another, related move. One move leads to another, through the medium of the sketches, which not only record the process of moves but also provoke thoughts and initiate new moves.",

The designers spin out a complex web of inter- related moves, reflections, decisions and further moves. They invest a great deal of cognitive effort in spinning and maintaining these webs, and so perhaps it is no wonder that they are reluctant to ‘stand back and adopt a fresh point of departure’. But sometimes it is necessary; a problem frame can prove to be inappropriate, or the designer lacks the ability to maintain a positive sequence of moves within the frame, and so a new departure point, a new problem frame becomes necessary.\n\nAn aspect of Schön’s study that helps to make it particularly informative is that it is based on the ‘live’ data of Quist’s talking and drawing. Because he is tutoring, Quist externalizes his thinking for the benefit of the student, when normally it would be a silent, internal cognitive process. This therefore provides an example of something like a ‘think-aloud’ protocol study, of the type which has come to be used extensively to investigate how designers think. The ‘protocols’ are the sequence of thoughts, reflected in the comments made by the designer. These protocol studies are normally conducted as a laboratory type of study, in which a designer is asked to ‘think aloud’ as he or she works through a short design project. Detailed evidence from these kinds of study will be used frequently in the later chapters of this book.\n\nThese various studies of design in action, based on watching what designers do, have tended to confirm what designers say about the nature of designing. There is the need to tolerate and work with uncertainty, to have the confidence to conjecture and explore, to interact constructively with sketches and models, and to rely upon one’s ‘intuitive’ powers of reflection-in-action.\n\nThinking about what designers do\n\nThe criticisms that Peter Rowe made of the way that designers tended to cling for too long to solution conjectures that were proving inadequate have also been reflected in comments by others.

Such guidelines generally outline a systematic procedure of first analysing the problem as fully as possible, then breaking this into sub-problems, finding suitable sub-solutions, evaluating these and then selecting and combining them into an overall solution. It is basically a process of analysis-synthesis-evaluation. However, this kind of procedure has been criticized in the design world because it seems to be based on inappropriate models imported from theories of problem-solving and ‘rational behaviour’, and therefore runs counter to designers’ more ‘intuitive’ ways of thinking and reasoning.\n\nSeveral theoretical arguments have been advanced in support of the view that design reasoning is different from the conventionally acknowledged forms of inductive and deductive reasoning. For example, Lionel March distinguished design’s mode of reasoning from those of logic and science. He pointed out: ‘Logic has interests in abstract forms. Science investigates extant forms. Design initiates novel forms. A scientific hypothesis is not the same thing as a design hypothesis. A logical proposition is not to be mistaken for a design proposal. A speculative design cannot be determined logically, because the mode of reasoning involved is essentially abductive.’\n\nMarch argued that the two conventionally understood forms of reasoning – deductive and inductive – only apply logically to analytical and evaluative types of activity. But the type of activity that is most particularly associated with design is that of synthesis, for which there is no commonly acknowledged form of reasoning. March drew on the work of the philosopher C. S. Peirce to identify this missing concept of abductive reasoning. According to Peirce, ‘Deduction proves that something must be; induction shows that something actually is operative; abduction suggests that something may be.’ It is this hypothesizing of what may be, the act of producing proposals or conjectures, appropriate to the situation that is central to designing.\n\nDeductive reasoning is the reasoning of formal logic: if you know a is the same as b, and b is the same as c, then you know that a must be the same as c. Inductive reasoning is the logic of science: you observe all the swans in a given region; you note that each and every swan is white; so you form a rule that ‘all swans are white’ (which you",

Abduction is the logic of design: you are asked to design a telephone for mature people; you know that mature people like clarity and elegant forms and colours; so you propose a design with a smoothly contoured, silver case and clear, black buttons (one of many possible proposals for achieving clarity and elegance).\n\nInstead of ‘abductive’ reasoning, Lionel March preferred to call designing ‘productive reasoning’ because the designer has to produce a design. ‘Appositional reasoning’ also seems to be a suitable term to use, because the designer makes a proposal for a solution that, when juxtaposed with the problem, seems to be an apposite response. Unlike conventional reasoning, a design solution cannot be derived directly from the problem, but can only be matched to it. Unlike the scientist, who searches for many cases to substantiate a rule, and then one case to falsify it, the designer can be gratified in being able to produce just one satisfactory case that gives an appropriate result.\n\nA comprehensive analysis of why the classic methods of reasoning in problem-solving are inappropriate in design has been provided by Henrik Gedenryd. Working from a cognitive science perspective, and applying it especially in the context of interaction design, Gedenryd argued against the view of cognition as a purely rational, ‘intra-mental’ (i.e. solely within the mind) activity and in favour of recognizing it as a practical, interactive activity. He concluded that ‘the mind working on its own is only a circumscribed portion of the full cognitive system’; the full system comprises mind, action and world, or a combination of thinking and acting within a physical environment. The designer’s natural way of working encompasses that larger system through interacting with temporary models of the situation being designed for. The range of design techniques, such as sketching, prototyping, mock-ups, scenarios, enables the designer to make ‘an inquiry into the future situation of use’. These techniques ‘make the world a part of cognition’ and provide the designer with a set of ‘situating strategies’. Hence, Gedenryd provided a theoretical understanding of the important role of these techniques and strategies in design. He showed that abstract thought alone cannot satisfactorily perform the complex task of designing.\n\n27",

The most significant outcomes from the varied studies and research into what designers do have been not only the growth of more explicit and articulated knowledge but also a greater understanding of and respect for all the designerly ways of knowing, acting and thinking that are at the core of design ability. The studies, research and reflection have also contributed to building a view of design as a cognitive discipline – a way of thinking – as well as a professional practice. This view has grown from a research-based understanding of the nature of design ability, from analysis of its strengths and weaknesses, and from a desire to support and nurture that ability.\n\nAs we have seen, one way of studying design thinking that has helped particularly to develop that better understanding has been through case studies of designers at work. This approach tries to establish the strategies, the modes of thinking and acting that designers actually use in practice. This fieldwork and case-study approach accepts that there is much to be learned from the natural, learned and practised ways that designers actually think and work.\n\nThe next part of this book begins a series of case studies of designers and design activities that will occur throughout the book. The case studies are intended to provide resources for the study of high-quality design thinking, with information and data drawn from both interviews and experimental investigations. In the next two chapters we will study two outstanding designers; the chapters are based on my own interviews and conversations with the designers.\n\nSummary\n\nDesigners typically report their ability as being based on intuitive, almost unconscious ways of thinking, but their feeling of ease is likely to be a result of considerable experience.

In design, problems and solutions are closely interwoven; a potential solution proposal may lead to rethinking the problem, and designers are used to accepting and coping with this kind of uncertainty. The use of external representations of solution ideas in the graphic language of sketches, drawings, and other kinds of models assists with the translation of abstract requirements into physical objects and may be a necessary part of the generation and exploration of ideas. The interaction between the designer and the representations has been characterized as ‘a reflective conversation with the situation’. Designers are solution-focused thinkers, using conjectures of initial solution ideas to provide a focus for further exploration. A possible problem with this is that conjectures might be made too early and become restrictive of wider exploration. Professional designing is a form of reflective practice, involving a process of framing a problem, pursuing a dialogue with and through the making of representations, and reflecting upon the implications and discoveries that emerge.

He joined the Brabham Formula One racing car team as a designer-draughtsman and was rapidly promoted to chief designer. For twelve years he carried the major responsibility for the design of a series of innovative and frequently successful racing cars. Brabham cars designed by Gordon Murray and driven by Nelson Piquet won two World Championships. In 1987 Gordon Murray then moved to the McLaren Formula One team as technical director.

Gordon Murray likens it to war. Engineering and technological development in wartime is the closest analogy to Formula One he can think of, with resources – human, financial and technical – being poured into the design and construction of machines that must have, and maintain, a vital performance edge over those of the opposition. Throughout the nine-month Formula One season there is a battle to be fought on a different field every other week, with a new campaign starting again every year.\n\nThis constant competitive atmosphere creates tremendous pressure, particularly on someone in the position that Gordon Murray was in for many years at Brabham of being totally in control of, and responsible for, the complete technical operation: designing, constructing, testing, racing and organizing, throughout the year, and from one year to the next. With the calendar of Grand Prix races fixed in advance, there is also constant time pressure, with no possibility of missing a race or practice session.\n\nThroughout a Formula One racing season there is constant work to make continuous improvements and adjustments to the current car design. These may be responses to obvious shortcomings, such as component failures, or to assessments of the car’s performance and handling, either in general or in relation to certain features of certain race circuits. The performance improvements aimed for may seem incredibly tiny by other standards – perhaps one-tenth of a second per lap – but they can make the difference between winning or losing the race. And at the same time, every other team is also making constant improvements, so the situation is never static.\n\n33",

As Gordon Murray says, ‘Given the situation and the pressure at any one time, you do get to a brick wall. I mean, you’re doing all these normal modifications, you know you can’t go any quicker, you need to make the step forward.’ Typically, such a step forward happens during the short close-season, when every team seeks to start the coming new season with an advantage over its rivals.\n\nIn many instances, and for most teams, this will be a new version of the previous season’s car; perhaps a new chassis, new suspension or a new engine to be accommodated; perhaps a change in regulations to be met. For Gordon Murray it would often mean trying a ‘step forward’, a radical new concept. In the midst of the pressure, the fervour, the panic, he ‘used to get breakthroughs, I mean I used to get like suddenly a mental block’s lifted’. These breakthroughs would come as a sudden illumination: ‘I know it’s a cliché, but I really did have a lot of good ideas in the bath!’ But such illuminations came, again in classical form, after long periods of immersion in, and preoccupation with the problem.\n\nIn Formula One there are always strict design requirements to be met: the technical and sporting regulations, which minutely and precisely specify the physical and operational limits within which the teams must compete, and which can change from season to season. Gordon Murray regards the constraints (the regulations) of racing car design, along with its intense pressure and competition, as fundamental to the necessity to innovate. Outside of racing car design he thinks that there may not be enough pressure on the designer, nor tight enough regulations, nor strong enough competition, for such radical, innovative design thinking as in Formula One.\n\nAnother crucial factor is the necessity and the motivation to carry through the bright idea into detailed implementation. Again, intense pressure, even in the close-season, ensures that ideas that look certain to be winners will be pushed through to detailed implementation with the same fervour as in the racing season.

In Formula One design, it is a matter not just of having ideas but of really implementing ideas that are going to improve performance, of having to ‘do it’, as Gordon says, ‘You have the idea, but you have to do it, and that’s what cuts the bullshit out.’\n\nSelf-adjusting suspension\n\nAs one example of radical innovation, Gordon Murray refers to the development at Brabham of a novel suspension system. At the time, the then Formula One governing body, FISA, became concerned to reduce the designed-in ‘ground effect’ on the cars. This effect had been pioneered on the Lotus team’s cars; smooth underbodies lying very close to the ground, side skirts right down to the ground and careful aerodynamic design provided a low-pressure under-car area which increased the car’s grip on the track surface. This meant much higher cornering speeds were possible, to the extent that some people became worried about the heavy g-force effects that were being imposed on the drivers, which might cause them to loose consciousness. FISA decided to ban the ‘sliding’ skirts that kept the body-ground gap closed but allowed fixed skirts and set a minimum underbody ground clearance of 6 centimetres. For Gordon Murray this sudden change in regulations was a stimulus to innovation. His first World Championship-winning car, he said,\n\ncame absolutely from the regulation change. You sit there and you read the regulations and think, how we are going to do it? How the hell can we get ground-effect back? What [the regulations] said was ‘At all times the car will have a 6 centimetre gap between the bodywork and the ground . . . and there can be no driver-operated device to change that gap’. And everybody looked at it, and built cars with 6 centimetre gaps . . . and I looked at it and I thought, if that 6 centimetre gap could be a 1 centimetre gap I could double the ground effect on the car; and it’s going to go down to a 1 centimetre gap at some point, like [under braking] at the end of the straight. So if I can make a physical thing . . . that drives the car down on its own, and holds the car down on its own without\n\n35",

So in three months we developed a hydro-pneumatic suspension system.\n\nGordon Murray’s thinking on this, and he says it came as a sudden illumination, was that the authorities had to accept that at some points during a race, any car’s ground clearance is going to be less than the 6 centimetres minimum simply because of the body dipping under braking, or rolling in corners and so on. Knowing that any driver- operated, mechanical device to alter the ground clearance was illegal, he focused on the physical forces, the ‘bits of nature’, that act on a car in motion. The downforce from air pressure on a moving car could, if the car was appropriately designed aerodynamically, push the car down over its whole length and width. The design challenge, therefore, was to let the natural downforce push the car down at speed, and then somehow to keep it down as it travelled around the circuit, but then allow the car to return to 6 centimetres clearance at standstill.\n\nThe ingenious solution used a hydro-pneumatic suspension system for the first time in Formula One, with struts at each wheel connected to hydraulic fluid reservoirs. As the car went faster, the natural downforce of airflow pushed the body lower on its suspension and the fluid in each suspension strut was pushed out into the reservoirs. The trick then was to find a way of letting the fluid return to the suspension struts only very slowly when the car slowed down. By the end of the first lap, the car body would be lower and would stay low, but on slowing down and stopping at the end of the race, the fluid would return from the reservoirs into the suspension struts, and the body would rise to the required 6 centimetres ground clearance.\n\nGordon Murray found how to achieve the required result in the\n\ntechnology of micro-filters, used mainly in the medical industry.\n\nThey were using these organic micro-filters which let the fluid through themselves but very, very, very, slowly. And we built the world’s tiniest throttle valve with one of these filters in it, and a tiny little pin – we were using drills that you couldn’t even see! We went and quickly developed what size hole we needed, so that it took a",

And because it took so long for the fluid to get back through the same valves and filters, it held the car down there, and after the race you have the slowing down lap . . . and the car just slowly came back up. Nothing to do with the driver at all, just physical forces. And we went to the first race in Argentina and just blew everybody into the weeds, just totally; and everybody went bananas!\n\nOther teams protested that the Brabham cars must have been fitted with a driver-operated device. It was obvious that the cars were lower during racing than they were in the pits, but of course the scrutineers could find no illegal device. Under pressure from the other teams, the authorities pointed out that the Brabham cars were clearly lower than 6 centimetres when out on the circuit, which contravened the regulations, but Gordon countered that, at various points, so was every other car. To curb the protests, he suggested to the authorities that every car could have its underbody painted, and at the end of the race every car which showed that at some point the underbody had rubbed the ground should be disqualified; and of course, the other teams would not accept this. Some other teams experimented haphazardly with variable suspension systems, but, very frustratingly for Gordon, just a few races later in the season, FISA reversed its stance and allowed driver-operated devices for controlling suspension height.\n\nThe Brabham self-adjusting suspension system was an example of an innovation initiated by a change in regulations which forced Gordon Murray’s thinking on how to retain the ground effect. It is an example of radical design innovation, through thinking from first principles about the effects of natural forces and having the motivation to follow through from a basic idea into finely detailed implementation.\n\nPit stops\n\nAnother example of radical innovation by Gordon Murray was the Brabham team’s introduction of planned pit stops for refuelling during\n\n37",

This was not so much an innovation in the car design per se but reflects more of a systems approach to the overall goal of winning each race. At that time it was not normal to have pit stops as regular, planned parts of the race routine and team strategy. Pit stops were for emergencies such as changing a punctured or badly worn tyre. For Gordon Murray, the innovation of introducing planned pit stops was part of an overall strategy arising from taking his thinking back to a basic issue – how to make the car lighter. The lighter the car, the faster it is in accelerating and decelerating.\n\nGordon says his mind was ‘banging away’ at this issue for a long time. He looked at the regulations and realized that there was nothing in them about when you could put fuel into the car. So the idea dawned of running the car with only a little over half the normal, full-race fuel load and including a pit stop for refuelling. But that was only the starting point for a thorough investigation of the implications of such an idea and of working through the detailed implementation. The first thing to do was to evaluate the implications of the idea. A pit stop took a lot of time; not only was there the actual stopped time of the car at the pits, but there was also the time lost in decelerating and driving into the pits and also in accelerating away again on tyres that take a couple of laps to heat up to optimum operating temperature. Formula One pit stops eventually became refined down to an incredibly quick norm of about six seconds actual stopped time, in which time over 100 litres of fuel were taken on and all four wheels changed. The total racing time lost was perhaps some twenty seconds. Gordon calculated that if the total racing time lost by a pit stop was less than twenty-six seconds, there could be sufficient advantage gained elsewhere to make it worthwhile.\n\nThere were many factors that came into calculating the advantage. As well as the weight reduction, half-size fuel tanks also have an advantage over full-size ones in that the car’s weight distribution is lower, and is more constant throughout the race, and the roll-couple on corners is lower, allowing faster cornering. The complicated choices of harder or softer tyre compounds also become a critical factor, because a lighter car can run on softer compounds which also improve cornering speeds. Even the psychology of racing came into",

For all of the objective, measurable factors, fine calculations were made, leading to the conclusion that a pit stop had to lose less than twenty-six seconds of racing time to be worthwhile. At that time, a quick pit stop for tyre changes took about fifteen seconds of actual stopped time. Gordon Murray calculated that he had to get this down to about ten seconds and to reduce as much as possible the slowing-down and warming-up times. And so, ‘the innovation process continues, because you’ve got all these new things that nobody’s done before that you have to come up with’. An extraordinary development programme had to be undertaken in an incredibly short time.\n\nFrom having the first idea to having a pit-stop car running and doing a test was three or four weeks, and that’s all the time that you have. So you would take each individual thing and tackle it. Say, OK, how can we get thirtyfive gallons into the car in ten seconds? The only way you’re ever going to do it is using pressure, and then you have a crash programme to develop a system . . . That’s what is great about race car design, because even though you’ve had the big idea – the ‘light bulb’ thing, which is fun – the real fun is actually taking these individual things, that nobody’s every done before, and in no time at all try and think of a way of designing them. And not only think of a way of doing them, but drawing the bits, having them made and testing them.\n\nWithin three weeks, they had thought of, designed, made and tested a pressure-fed refuelling system. To improve pit-stop procedures, Gordon hired a film crew to film the team practising pit stops and then played back the film, stopping it to identify difficulties and errors, and devising ways to improve the procedures. The new systems, the improvements and the training of the pit team got the actual stopped time down to under the target of ten seconds. One ‘big killer’ remained:\n\nWhen you put new tyres on they were cold, and it always took two laps to get back up to speed, and the time you lost in those two\n\n39",

So then I thought, well I know the tyres start working at seventy degrees centigrade . . . so we designed an oven, a wooden oven with a gas-fired heater, and we heated the tyres up, and ten seconds before the car was coming in we opened the oven door, whipped the tyres out, put them on, and the guy was instantly quick. Now every Grand Prix team has tyre heating; that’s where it started.\n\nPit stops to change all four wheels and tyres with varying hard or soft compounds (with a stopped time of just a couple of seconds) are now a key factor in race strategy for every Formula One team.\n\nThe example of the introduction of the ‘pit-stop car’ illustrates how a radical innovation was driven by the competitive urge to find a significant advantage within the constraints of the regulations; how the basic creative idea had to be evaluated on precise calculations; how a total systems approach was adopted; and how implementation had to be carried through to fine levels of detail.\n\nDesigning from first principles\n\nAs well as the competitive pressure and the tight constraints, Gordon Murray emphasizes that an important factor in innovative design is reconsidering the problem situation from first principles; he stresses the need to ‘keep looking back at fundamental physical principles’. His innovative suspension system was based on such fundamental physical principles as the natural air-pressure downforce on a fast- moving car. The McLaren F1 sports car was also conceived according to the principles of Formula One design – principles such as lightness of materials, rigour of construction and optimization of performance. These principles were proved when some GTR racing versions of the F1 were produced; at their first outing, in the 1995 Le Mans twenty- four-hours race, McLaren F1s came first, third, fourth and fifth.\n\nThe unconventional ‘arrowhead’ seating layout (see Figure 2.1) also came from first principles. It is based on the racing principle of placing the driver at the centre of the car and is something he has used again in other car designs. It was something that Gordon Murray had had in mind for many years, as evidenced by a sketch for a car",

The seating layout is a very visible example of how he is prepared always to think anew about any aspect of the car that he is designing.\n\nSteering column\n\nAs a less-visible example of his approach to designing from first principles, Gordon Murray refers to a small, and perhaps seemingly insignificant, part of the McLaren F1, the steering column. ‘Conventionally, it would have been, right, steering columns are typically three-quarter-inch solid steel bars.’ He explained how this conventional solution arises because the column not only has to carry torsional forces from the resistance to the turning wheels but also bending loads from the driver leaning and pulling on it whilst getting in and out of the car. It also has conventional points of support, is mounted in rubber bushes to reduce noise and is encased in a plastic housing for reasons of appearance and convenience. But it does not provide the sort of direct steering feel that a racing driver needs and that feeling was supposed to be one of the principles embodied in the design of the McLaren F1.\n\nSo Gordon decided to start by separating the needs to carry both torque and bending loads. Whatever the form of the steering column itself, it still needs a cover to house electrical cables and to mount switches, ‘so if you’ve got to have that anyway, why not use the insect principle where the skeleton’s on the outside, and make that the structure that takes all the bending forces?’ This thinking led to the design of the steering column itself as an aluminium tube of just 1 millimetre wall thickness, possible because it is only taking torque and not tension or compression. The support point is closer behind the steering wheel rather than down at the dashboard, and the system is now much lighter but stronger than a conventional solution and also has the right racing feel (Figure 2.2). The design process stemmed from considering first principles – separating the torque and bending loads – and from an imaginative breakthrough – using the housing cover for structural purposes as well as appearance and practicality.\n\n41",

For example, Martin Stacey and his colleagues looked at idea creation by analogical transfer in a study of a team of designers who were generating ideas for a new product: a ‘digital pen’ using novel print-head technology. The envisaged pen might be a children’s toy or perhaps a craft or art tool. Some initial issues that were identified from an existing basic engineering prototype included keeping the print-head level and constraining the way it contacts potential printing media.\n\nHere is an extract of the team’s discussion of ideas on how to\n\ncontrol the print head and keep it flat on a variable surface:\n\nJack: A sledge manages to keep level by having quite a wide base and then a main force in the middle, unlike a set of skis which are quite narrow and you go up on an edge when you’re turning. A sledge is quite broad and you have the weight right in the middle so they manage to keep both runners on the snow.\n\nAlan: So would you potentially see some guiders down the side\n\nof it?\n\nJack: Well, I guess the easiest way to keep the pen at a right angle would be to have a set of stabilizers on it, like a bicycle. Chad: I was thinking of maybe like a flat base with a sort of universal joint like a windsurf mast. The face is quite big but it stays flat, but the bit you hold on to can be at different angles.\n\nThe analogies brought into play here are far removed from the immediate context of the design project, going from a sledge to children’s bicycle stabilizers to a windsurf mast. In this example they are all to do with controlling and guiding a flat object moving across a variable and low-friction surface. At other times, closer analogies might be used – at one point the team was discussing the unusually broad head of this pen:\n\nChad: So it’s more like a paintbrush isn’t it, like a DIY paintbrush Tom: It’s more like a roller, yeah\n\n43",

But for many years he nursed a very different concept of what a car could be: a small, cheap, efficient city car. After he left McLaren he began development of this very different kind of car in his own design company. The resulting concept was announced as the T.25 city car. The T.25 is a very practical urban-use vehicle that can carry a driver with two passengers or with a large amount of luggage or shopping; it is light and agile, with good performance and low fuel consumption, and occupies one-third of the road or parking space of a conventional car.\n\nFor this car Gordon Murray also developed an innovative manufacturing process, which is as important to the project as the innovative automotive design concept. This integrated thinking was essential to his approach to designing a low-cost solution, as he explained:\n\nYou need something that is small, light, radical, efficient, and it has to be cheap, because one thing you can’t do is build the world’s most sophisticated little city car that will save the world and then say to people it costs £20,000, because you won’t sell many – if you don’t sell enough it won’t make a difference, and the way you reduce the cost of producing a car and therefore the retail price is by first of all reducing the part count, the number of parts that go into the car, and that you do by design and by conceptual design.",

His aim was to develop not just a new type of car but a new concept of personal transport.\n\nJust as in his racing car design work, the city car is also designed from first principles. This is clear in some of Gordon’s earliest sketches for the car, in which he pays special attention to the suspension system (Figure 2.3). The suspension system is an important feature in early considerations because a tall, narrow car such as the T.25 tends to roll sideways on corners and that has to be countered in the suspension system. He also explained that, for economy, ‘I want to\n\nFIGURE 2.3 Some of Gordon Murray’s early sketches for the city car concept: (a) overall concept, (b) a very early sketch of suspension and other details, made in a pocket notebook, around the same time as the concept sketches.

The same kind of thinking applied also, for example, to the ‘frog-eye’ style of headlight design.\n\nIt’s not just styling, it’s a practical point of view because I only want to have one sub-wiring loop for cost, so I want to put the [wing] mirror in the back of the light, so you have headlamp, parking lamp, main beam, low beam, indicators, side repeater, heating element, adjusting element for the mirror, and the mirror, on one sub-loop with one plastic plug, so you have one moulded pod that does all those things, all those functions.\n\nEven a radical concept such as the easy access, lift-up opening canopy, rather than side doors, came from the same approach.\n\nGoing from seven openings to five makes a car a lot cheaper and more rigid and lighter; going from five to three and from three to two is magic, and going down to one you can’t get any better – you’ve got to get into the car. So that sort of stuff you think about from the beginning, and that applies to lights, mirrors, instruments, wheels, brakes, everything.\n\nAfter producing many dozens of small sketches of details and concepts over several years (Figure 2.4), and experimenting with performance, using different engines in some existing small cars, the design work took a major step forward when Gordon and his team built a very simple, full-size mock-up of the car, using wire and cardboard (Figure 2.5). The final version of the city car (Figure 2.6) bore a striking resemblance to that simple mock-up. The mock-up was also a useful design tool, as it began to suggest some new possibilities. For example, Gordon’s earlier idea for the seating arrangement was for two people sitting in tandem, the passenger behind the driver. But when the mock-up was built, ‘we discovered that you could, quite easily with the same width of motor car, for short journeys, you could take three people in it’, using a similar seating layout as in the McLaren F1.

Gordon explained:\n\nAt one stage, we were looking at having to have a boot lid to access the engine, until one of the guys said, Come and look at this, if you stand in the car you can open what is effectively your boot floor from the inside of the car, you can get to the oil and water and stuff from there – you fold up the seats, open the hatch in the floor and you are there.\n\nThe T.25 had a 660 cc petrol engine, but a T.27 electric version was developed as well. Like Gordon Murray’s Formula One cars and the McLaren F1, both the T.25 and T.27 were also winners – but for energy economy rather than speed. In 2010 the T.25 won the Royal Automobile Club’s Future Car Challenge, with a 97 miles per gallon fuel consumption over the 60-mile course from Brighton to London, and the next year the T.27 won the electric car class and best overall, with an energy consumption of just 7 kilowatt-hours, equivalent to 340 miles per gallon.

It represents some almost- fixed decisions about how big the motor might be and how big the dust collection cylinder might be.

Team members might view this ambiguity in many different and positive ways, resulting in a number of interpretations and ideas from the model.\n\nAs David Mlynski, the design engineer who built the model said, ‘When I’m modelling in card I’m still exploring the problem.

One of his significant failures was the Brabham ‘surface cooling’ car. This radical concept was meant to be several steps forward at once: reduction in weight, improvement in driver safety and what was meant to be a long-term technical advantage over the opposition. His imaginative idea of surface cooling was to do away with normal radiators for cooling the engine, and instead to pass the water and oil through surface heat exchangers built integrally into the monocoque structure; the ‘skin’ of the car was therefore both structure and radiator.\n\nThere were innumerable detailed implementation problems with the surface cooling features, and trials soon showed that surface cooling was not going to work. So a revamped version of the previous season’s car had to be rushed out for the new season. However, Gordon was also working on another radical innovation, related not only to cooling the engine but also to increasing the car’s ground effect. Introduced in the middle of the season, this new version became known as the ‘fan car’ because it was fitted at the rear with a large fan, primarily for cooling the engine but which also happened to extract large amounts of air from underneath the car and therefore enhance the downforce. Driven by Niki Lauda, the car easily won its first race, but, as with the attempt to increase ground effect with the hydro-pneumatic suspension system, it faced immediate protests from the other teams. The use of the fan was controversial because although engine cooling fans were legal, devices for increasing downforce were not. Gordon’s argument was that ‘If we don’t have the fan then the engine will overheat’. However, the protests were so strong and influential that the Brabham team decided not to use the fan car again after its first race. It wasn’t exactly a failure, but Gordon learned from the experience of the fan car, and much later, in 2020, introduced a more sophisticated version of the concept in the design of his new sports car, the Gordon Murray Automotive T.50 (Figure 2.8). This supercar is claimed to have the most advanced aerodynamics of any road car, offering an ultra-smooth body shape and marking a new development in ground-effect innovations\n\n51",

This car was designed to be as low as possible, with the driver almost lying flat. It involved also putting the engine into a reclined position, and this was the feature that proved not to work. Gordon said, ‘We just could not get the lay-down engine to scavenge the oil properly, and we kept losing a lot of horsepower.’ But he learned from the failure, and two years later at McLaren he was able to develop the same concept more successfully:\n\nI did a lay-down McLaren, just like at Brabham but with a Honda engine that worked, and we won fifteen out of the sixteen races.

      "content": "DESIGNING TO WIN\n\nDesign process and working methods\n\nAlthough Gordon Murray carried immense personal responsibility for the design work of his racing cars, and of course for his city car, for which he founded his own company, inevitably it involved a lot of teamwork. Clearly he has been successful in inspiring others to work with him. He likes to involve team members in the design problems and for that reason prefers to recruit all-rounders to his team: ‘I never have engineers that aren’t designers.’ He also likes to work collectively, standing around a drawing board or a mock-up discussing problems and trying ideas. For the McLaren F1 design, he installed a five-metre long drawing board in the design office, so that the car could be drawn full size, and several team members could gather round to contribute. He likes to have people around ‘to bounce ideas off’, and prefers to give them enough freedom and responsibility to feel that they are really making a worthwhile contribution to the team. His personal motivation manifests itself in a dedication which he also expects to find in the other members of his design team; he expects to appoint people who ‘if you cut them, they bleed motor oil’.\n\nGordon’s personal design process is based on starting with a quick sketch of a whole idea, which is then developed through many different refinements. He said that,\n\nI do a quick sketch of the whole idea, and then if there’s one bit that looks good, instead of rubbing other bits out, I’d put that bit to one side; I’d do it again and expand on the good bit, and drop out the bad bit, and keep doing it, doing it; and end up with all these sketches, and eventually you end up throwing ninety percent of these away.\n\nHe also talks to himself – or rather, writes notes to himself on the sketches, notes such as ‘rubbish’, ‘too heavy’ or ‘move it this way 30 mm’. Eventually he gets to the stage of more formal, orthographic drawings, but still drawing annotated plans, elevations and sections all together, ‘Until at the end of the day the guys at Brabham used to call them “Gordon’s Wonder Plots”, because they used to say “It’s a wonder anybody could see what’s in them”!’\n\n53",

As with the previous chapter, the main purpose of making this study is to seek insight into the design thinking of someone who is a very successful, innovative designer.\n\nKenneth Grange is a well-known and very experienced designer of a great variety of products that range in scale from ball-point pens and shavers to taxi cabs and railway engines. His career has spanned over more than fifty years, and many of his designs became (and remain) familiar items in the household or on the street – or on the rail track. These designs include food mixers for Kenwood, razors for Wilkinson Sword, cameras for Kodak, typewriters for Imperial, clothes irons for Morphy Richards, washing machines for Bendix, pens for Parker, lamps for Anglepoise and the front end of the British Rail high-speed train engine. He is one of the RSA’s elite corps of ‘Royal Designers for Industry’, and his designs have won ten UK Design Council Awards and the Duke of Edinburgh’s Prize for Elegant Design. He has won the Gold Medal of the Chartered Society of Designers, and in 2001 he was awarded the Prince Philip Designers’ Prize – an award honouring lifetime achievement.\n\nBackground: The art of technical design\n\nKenneth Grange’s very successful career appears to have started and developed initially by a series of accidents.

After four years at Willesden School of Arts and Crafts, London, where ‘all I really learned was draughtsmanship’, and a short job as a scene painter with the BBC’s television department, the principal of the art school recommended Kenneth to ‘go and see a woman he knew who was working in the Institute of Town Planning’. This contact in turn recommended him to some architect friends of hers, who turned out to be the firm of Arcon, a leading progressive architectural firm of that era. Kenneth recalls that ‘I had never heard of architecture, I hadn’t the slightest idea of what this meant, but they gave me a job in what they called their technical publications department’, making presentation drawings for clients.\n\nSoon after, at age nineteen, Kenneth Grange was then subject to two years of conscription into the British Army, where his ‘little portfolio’ of drawings got him allocated not to painting camouflage on tanks as he might have expected but as an illustrator producing drawings for instruction manuals. This work involved taking apart, usually by personal trial and error, various artillery mechanisms and then making drawings to illustrate the parts and their assembly. ‘You had to draw them in such a way, order the drawings in such a way, that it was a re-assembly process that you were explaining.’ This self-instruction in the assembly and re-assembly of military machines became Kenneth’s introduction to technical design, and the beginning of his fascination with the way things work, with the necessities of practicality and function that became underlying principles of his approach to design.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Kenneth returned to his architect colleagues for work. One of the Arcon partners, Jack Howe, encouraged Kenneth to undertake some independent work of his own. These private jobs were mostly ‘week-ends painting a mural or whatever. But somehow I picked up a little job which was doing an exhibition for the then [UK] Atomic Energy Authority’. This little job was so successful that the client called him again some months later, to say ‘We’ve taken space at an exhibition in Geneva, and would you like to design the exhibition stand for us?’ The new job turned out to be too large for Kenneth to be able to cope with on his own, ‘but within a month I’d got three people working for me full-time, and we were working in my flat, we’d taken over the living-room as well as the little office-workshop I’d got, and with every week the job increased.

And so the Kenneth Grange design consultancy was accidentally up and running.\n\nLooking for improvement\n\nA significant feature of much of Kenneth Grange’s design work is that it often arises from a fundamental reassessment of the purpose, function and use of the product. However, this radical, innovative ability is not necessarily the reason why clients invite him to take on a new job. He says: ‘You are invariably brought in by somebody who has got a very elementary commercial motive in changing the perception of the product. It’s extremely unusual for someone to be brought in to approach it from this usability, this function theme.’ But he feels the need for a ‘secure foundation’ when starting a new project and that foundation is the product functionality: how things work and how they are used.\n\nI am never daunted by the blank sheet of paper because I know I can at least fill in my time by trying to sort out just the functionality, just the handling of it, and by-and-large out of that comes a direction, and then it’s a question of tuning. I think it’s due to what your temperament is, your personality. I think, with my background, and my own knowledge about my weaknesses, I am bound to need to have a secure foundation on which I stand when I am arguing about something, and I am not very comfortable when I find myself required to be the prima donna.\n\nHis practical attitude towards product functionality also extends into his normal, everyday life. ‘As I get older I get less and less tolerant of things that don’t work easily, and so I think I go around looking for trouble!’ As an example, he recounts an experience in a restaurant, specializing in serving mussels:\n\nThe waiter comes along and dumps on the table a big stainless steel bowl [of mussels] with a lid, and this is hot. My companion’s lid had handles on it, and mine didn’t have handles on it. That made me furious, and I alone in that restaurant – probably they have never had anybody else complain about it – but not Grange: he\n\n57",

I can’t resist it, because I find that so much like a real affront!\n\nSewing machine\n\nBeing affronted by the poor usability of a product means that in his own design work Kenneth Grange inevitably puts ease of use at the forefront of his thinking. A clear example of this is provided by his design of a sewing machine for Frister & Rossman, a firm based in Germany producing high-quality, well-engineered machines, who were looking for new designs to update their product range. In this case, Kenneth’s attitude led him into trying out the existing sewing machine and looking for ways in which to improve it from the user’s point of view. From those insights he was able to generate a completely new version of a standard product. His resulting design incorporated the existing machinery but repackaged it in novel ways that made the machine easier to use and gave it a new and distinctive form and style (Figure 3.1).\n\nThe origins of the new design features lay in Kenneth’s functional, practical approach and on his personal experience. His starting point was his own use of the sewing machine: ‘I chose to use it, actually making things with a sewing machine, so I did fairly quickly come to understand just fundamental strengths and weaknesses.’ He found what he regarded as a ‘contradiction’ in the conventional design. The sewing machine mechanism is conventionally located centrally over its base platform, whereas the user needs more surface space on their side in front of the needle, rather than behind it. He explained that, ‘In front of the needle, the deeper the table on which you can actually assemble and lay and just get the tension of the fabrics right, the better. Once the work is behind the needle you can do nothing about it, it’s sewn, therefore you don’t need any more space for the fabric.’ Kenneth therefore simply moved the sewing machine mechanism rearwards on its base, creating an off-centre layout with more base-table space in front of the needle than behind it. To him, this appeared a virtually self- evident improvement to make: ‘This is such a straightforward thing to do, but the reason it had not been done before was because the sewing machine had been designed as a very straightforward, basic piece of engineering which needed stability. Therefore the mechanism",

Courtesy of Kenneth Grange.\n\nwas from the very beginning put centrally upon the base and nobody had thought about challenging the space beyond and the space in front of the needle.’ Once this challenge had been met, and the benefit of an off-centre layout perceived, then ‘the rest of the shape follows, the rest of the shape just absolutely falls into place from that’.\n\nAnother radical change in this particular sewing machine design was also a result of a simple, fundamental assessment of how the machine is used. Kenneth gave the base of the machine rounded lower edges, which might look like a mere ‘styling’ feature, but in fact also arose from function.\n\nThere was something that they told me, which is that a frequent problem with sewing machines, particularly when you are sewing a new fabric, is that a lot of lint comes off the fabric, loose fibres and so on. This gets down into the bobbin and at worst stops the machine, at best will get itself sewn back into the thing, so you haven’t got an absolutely clean stitch, which affects the tension, the thread, etc. And they said, this is a problem, and their way of dealing with it was to make sure you could open the front and get the bobbin out.\n\n59",

      "content": "60\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nThis was achieved by the user tilting the machine away from them into a rather unstable position that only allowed restricted access to the shuttle mechanism in the underside of the base.\n\nTo Kenneth Grange, this was simply inadequate. ‘I thought, that doesn’t seem to me to be very clever, why don’t we make sure we can open the thing and really get at it? So I tilted the thing sideways, I rolled the whole thing back so it stood up and was very firm, and you could get the whole of the guts apart and get at the lint and so on, and that in itself generated a shape because then the back edge of the machine naturally had a roll to it.’ The rounded edge made it easier for the user to tilt the machine, it rested more stable and secure, and the underside was accessible for cleaning and oiling the lower mechanisms. A rounded top front edge was also provided to the base plate, to allow the fabric to slide over it more easily, and various other features were added, such as small drawers for holding accessories. Kenneth’s sketches, illustrating his approach, are shown in Figure 3.2. The sewing machine design demonstrates how Kenneth Grange approaches design from a functional viewpoint. The innovative ‘style’ and features of the new machine were generated from considering and responding to the normal patterns of its use. He says, ‘I think it’s a question of what your attitude is towards anything, any working thing. My attitude is to want it to be a pleasure to operate. I’m a great believer in pleasure in products.’ But it is not only the product’s user he seeks to please, it’s also important to please the client who commissioned it: it’s about ‘wanting to please the consumer and the client’.\n\nAnother aspect of this approach is that he considers the whole pattern of use, as exemplified by considering the requirements for periodically cleaning the machine, and by considering how the user prepares and introduces the fabric into the stitching mechanism, thus requiring more make-up space in front of the needle than behind it. It is a fundamental part of his interest in how things work: ‘Those are the things that intrigue me, recognising that there is a difference between what happens after a particular process and what happens before it, and so on, and preparing yourself for those two stages.’\n\nThe case of redesigning the sewing machine is an example of Kenneth Grange’s attitude of frustration with poor design, as evidenced in his account of the handle-less mussels pot. Like most designers, he has an attitude of discontent towards many existing products: they can always be improved. He says, ‘The designer should be inquisitive",

This constructive thinking is often triggered by observing how things are actually used by people and noticing the difficulties, large or small, that they experience but perhaps take for granted.\n\n61",

Conventional vegetable peelers were ugly as well as difficult and uncomfortable to use. Sam might have taken over the peeling himself but, as a designer, he realized there was a need to develop new kitchen utensils for the many people who had difficulty handling conventional kitchen utensils, and that they could be more effective and aesthetically pleasing. Sam’s idea was for a new peeler that would be comfortable and secure to grip and manipulate when both dry and wet, attractive and moreover an inclusive design usable by a broad range of users.\n\nSam worked on this concept with the Smart Design consultancy. They developed a design for the peeler based on an oval handle form with soft, flexible fins carved into it to provide the required improved grip for finger and thumb (Figure 3.3). They used a neoprene material that is squeezable and has a comfortable, soft feel with a slight friction to help the grip. The design for the vegetable peeler was the start of a whole new range of kitchen products produced by OXO, a company that Farber started. The products have won awards for usability, appearance and innovative use of materials. Sam has been quoted: ‘It’s hard to think of a vegetable peeler as a radical innovation. But I guess it was!’\n\nFIGURE 3.3 (a) The OXO GoodGrips vegetable peeler; (b) typical pre-OXO peelers. Courtesy of OXO.

These were actually the directors of the company that owned Frister & Rossman, the Maruzen company, based in Osaka, Japan. After being carefully briefed by them in Osaka, he returned to England to start the design work and actually developed two different designs. One was the radical new design and the other was more conservative – ‘It created a new form, but followed the brief precisely and did not alter the basic layout of the mechanics.’ Kenneth returned to Osaka with models of both designs.\n\nThe night before I was due to present my proposal, I looked long and hard at the two versions. I was afraid of looking foolish should some blindingly obvious reason be revealed for not deviating from the original brief. Only when I left my room the following morning did I decide to opt for excitement and take them the non-briefed model. In the event, they were very impressed.\n\nGoing well beyond the requirements of the original brief was also a major feature of one of Kenneth Grange’s most prestigious and long- lasting designs, the front bodywork of the high-speed train introduced into passenger service by British Rail in the 1970s, and still in use. It was perhaps surprising for an industrial designer, usually working on much smaller machines and devices, to find himself involved in the design of such a major engineering work, but again it illustrates Kenneth’s functional approach, eagerness to make improvements and to do what seems necessary, rather than just what is asked for.\n\nKenneth recalls that ‘They didn’t call me up and say, We’d like you to design a locomotive’. It began much more modestly, as a result of some smaller jobs that he had undertaken for the railway company, such as redesigning their timetables.\n\nI had done a number of jobs for the railways, all quite modest jobs, but one or two of them quite important; like I was responsible for changing the basic format of timetabling. When I was asked to redesign a timetable for them, it was one of those printed sheets\n\n63",

They were actually drivers’ schedules; they didn’t start by telling you where the train was going, they started by telling you what time the trains went out, and which track, the departure track. Further down was where the thing was going, if you took the time to read it all; it was a list of where the stops were, which is not the way to organise a timetable. The person rushing in to the station, the only thing he knows is where he is going, you want to be able to look up your destination and then see the time of the train, but it was exactly the other way around.\n\nSo Kenneth redesigned the timetable simply to improve it, so that ‘Where you are going comes first, and after that comes the time the train leaves’, and that is how all railway timetables are now organized.\n\nLocomotive\n\nThe High Speed Train (HST) was a project developed within British Rail as a kind of internal company rival to the much-vaunted Advanced Passenger Train (APT) being developed during the same period, which used radical new technologies such as tilting carriages to increase running speeds. The APT project eventually failed altogether, whereas the HST, using evolutionary developments of conventional engineering (and some APT innovations), became hugely successful and, in its prototype version, with a Kenneth Grange-designed front end, set a world speed record for diesel locomotive traction of 230 kilometres per hour.\n\nAfter some small jobs for British Rail, such as the timetable redesign, Kenneth Grange was approached by their Head of the Design Department, James Cousins, about ‘a paint job, the painting of the outside of a train’. This train was the new HST.\n\nSo I went in to see him and he had a model there, and it was a model of a very crude bullet-nosed train, and he said to me, This is being produced by the Engineering Department, this is the train they intend to make, but I can’t possibly let them get away with this awful paintwork.

I went away and I did that but I also thought, I could improve the shape of this.\n\nThe brief, therefore, was for a styling contribution – a paint livery that might improve the appearance of the train. But Kenneth was not satisfied with such a restricted, paint job contribution; he wanted the styling to emerge from the function, and so, without telling his client, he found an aerodynamicist and managed to get use of a wind tunnel test facility at Imperial College, London, and began to make a series of models of the front of the train, gradually developing a better, more efficient, overall shape.\n\nSo bit by bit we developed an evolution of the shape of the train, based upon wind tunnel testing. I then went along to Cousins with this information and I said, Here’s some photos of a shape that’s not your bullet-nose, but it’s a shape that I think is much more elegant – and by the way, here’s the paint job. And he went into a meeting with the Board, and when this thing came up on the agenda he said, Here’s the model and here’s the livery I propose, but we have taken the liberty of doing some preliminary work on the shape; we believe that the shape proposed – nothing to do with the [engineering of the] running gear, with the actual motor, and so on – but we believe the shape actually could be more efficient. And he had the wind tunnel photographs and the Engineering Department had never been near a wind tunnel! I wish I had been in the meeting, I’m sure it was a real landmark meeting, when the Board was persuaded by these photos from the wind tunnel. Then afterwards he came out of the meeting and came back and said, Well, we have a job to do! But the rest was then relatively easy.\n\nA successful prototype was developed to Kenneth’s design, but the story did not end there.\n\nI had kept strictly within the technical terms of the brief. This dictated a window made of exceptionally strong flat glass, which severely limited its size, and a single driver’s seat positioned centrally.

This had a profound effect on the design, since our aerodynamics, vindicated by the speed record, relied on a smooth flow of air to left and right of the front window.\n\nThere was a number of inter-related problems raised by the necessity of providing for two, side-by-side operators at the front of the cab, instead of the one central operator. The central, relatively small window in the prototype would have to be replaced by two windows with a central bar, and the extra window width inevitably flattened the front profile, thus reducing the aerodynamic efficiency. Even when the glassmakers found that a larger, single sheet of the toughened glass could be produced, the aerodynamic problem was still there.\n\nOne way of regaining the aerodynamic efficiency appeared to be to elongate and lower the rake of the cab front, so as to direct more air up and over the top rather than around the sides. But this option was denied by the technical requirement of providing the locomotive’s buffers at the front, which were located in a fixed position relative to the wheel bogies and could not be fully enclosed. Train buffers are necessary not, as is often thought, to cushion the train’s stop at the end of the track but to assist the locomotive to shunt carriages around in the assembling of complete trains.\n\nKenneth was unhappy about losing the aerodynamic efficiency\n\nand pursued the matter with the railways’ chief engineer.\n\nCredit is due to the chief engineer, because I wasn’t welcomed by these guys, but to this man’s everlasting credit I was sitting in a meeting with him, going over this fact that this new design was not as efficient as the one that they originally bought, and which had already set a world record. But there is no way you can have the geometry and have the wide window and get the same effect, and we were backwards and forwards over this. I suppose I knew that if we didn’t have buffers I’d get a different shape, so I said to him, Tell me again, tell me about buffers, how they work; thinking there might be some way I could sleek them in somehow or other. But you see, you’ve got this great plate and you’ve got probably fifteen inches of movement on the springs because of the shunting, and",

And he said, Well, it is true that with this vehicle, which we’ve never, ever made before, we’ve never, ever made a train where the coaches are always attached, with this, of course, they’ll always stay coupled. And he said, So if it’s always coupled, it can’t be used for shunting, and therefore the only thing we need is a hard link. And so he said, So really we don’t need the buffers. To his credit he was prepared to say, We’ve overlooked it. They’d never, ever made a complete train like that before; they made locomotives, and they made carriages.\n\nThe HST was to be a fixed formation of passenger carriages between powercars at each end, which would not require shunting to assemble and disassemble trains. The development of the HST nose design is illustrated in Figure 3.4.\n\nKenneth’s perseverance had led to the vital breakthrough. The buffers on this locomotive for a new, permanently coupled train could be dispensed with. The aerodynamic efficiency could be retained by diverting the airflow from around the sides to over the top of a sleeker, more stylish, cab front. British Rail had a completely new, modern image, arising from its original request for ‘a paint job’. The HST train is still in service, and on its fortieth anniversary in 2016 one of the locomotives was named the ‘Sir Kenneth Grange’ in honour of its (recently knighted) designer (Figure 3.5).\n\nThe acceptance of the convention of having buffers on a locomotive is an example of fixation – a kind of unconscious, blinkered thinking in\n\nFIGURE 3.4 Development of the nose of the High Speed Train to improve aerodynamics: (a) rounded nose with buffers; (b) raked nose without buffers.

In both the sewing machine and the high-speed train, Kenneth Grange was able to create innovative designs by questioning some conventional aspects of existing designs that were taken for granted as being essential. As Gordon Murray said, a creative designer has to keep their previous experience, and their knowledge of existing designs, at the back of their mind, not the front.\n\nCase note: Fixation\n\nBrian Meek was designing a new version of an existing,\n\nsuccessful fret saw for the Knew Concepts company. This kind of saw is used for precise, intricate cutting of wood and metal, for example in marquetry or jewellery, and its frame needs to be light and also stiff both longitudinally (along the blade) and in torsion (around the blade). The existing saw had a frame of titanium with holes cut into it to reduce weight (Figure 3.6.a). Because of rapidly rising material costs, Brian was looking for a new design that would use less material. A way to do that would be to assemble the saw from smaller, separate pieces, in place of the single-piece frame",

Brian began experimenting with making the frame from three separate pieces (two legs and the top) which could be cut with less waste from a smaller sheet of material. The problem then was how to join the pieces together into a form that was sufficiently stiff. A prototype was made with a two- piece top riveted to a pair of legs (Figure 3.6.b). Brian commented: ‘We tried for about six months to figure out some way to puzzle- piece a basically 2-D frame together, with no luck. Most of those designs were rigid in tension, but had no torsional rigidity at all.’\n\nThen, in the midst of some tinkering, Brian almost accidentally came upon a three-dimensional truss structure. ‘I took home some test parts that I’d been fiddling with one night. I got completely sick of looking at them, and bent them outwards to form the basis of the truss that you now see [on the final product]. I zig-zagged a bit of strip across the top as bracing, just to see what would happen . . . Bingo! It didn’t deflect at all, and a design was born’ (Figure 3.6.c). The final design, with a more refined top part, was named the ‘birdcage saw’ (Figure 3.6.d).\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Evolution of the fret saw frame: (a) the prior one-piece frame; (b) a multi-piece frame; (c) the top frame parts spread into a 3-D truss; (d) the final ‘birdcage’ design.

He even mounted a whole exhibition of ‘Those that got away’ – more than forty design proposals and prototypes that were rejected by his clients or failed to go into manufacture, including a postmodern-styled toaster and a wine bottle shaped deliberately to provide a ‘glug’ sound as it poured. One of them was a design for the Channel Tunnel Eurostar train, running between Britain and continental Europe. Kenneth was one of four designers invited to submit proposals, and he felt confident of winning the competition, given his previous experience with the HST. He worked on two designs, one with a ‘bubble’ windscreen for the driver, and one much closer to the HST shape. He says that, ‘Because I thought the train was a sort of natural son of the HST, I abandoned the bubble idea’. But the competition was won by someone who produced a design based around just such a ‘bubble’ windscreen. Kenneth suspects that his design may have been rejected because it looked somewhat similar to his design of the earlier British HST train. ‘The real blunder for me was to have even thought of a reference to the HST. Clearly the French and the Belgian partners most certainly would not have wanted a son of the British national train on “their” railways!’\n\nAnother railway-related design failure for Kenneth was the ‘net chair’ he designed for British Rail. The goal was to produce a very",

Kenneth found a net fabric used to make astronaut couches in spacecraft. Through a lot of experimentation with frames for holding this fabric, he produced a highly ergonomic, comfortable and very lightweight seat in which the stretched net fabric was the primary support for the user. But unfortunately the seat fabric was realized to be highly vulnerable to vandalism. Some train passengers were not the sort of people that Kenneth was seeking to please with his elegant design. ‘We had reckoned without the spite of the travelling yobbo who, with one quick slash of a knife, could destroy the seat.’ This was a lesson about realizing the whole wide range of people who are likely to be the ‘users’ of a new design.\n\nDesign process and working methods\n\nThe examples of the Frister & Rossman sewing machine and the British Rail High Speed Train illustrate Kenneth Grange’s approach to design, which seems predominantly to be based on generating style and form from function and use. This seems to be the natural way for him to work, even though his clients sometimes do not realize this, and approach him as a ‘stylist’. ‘They think’, he says,\n\nWe need a new design, we need a new style. They’re sharp enough to realise the style is outdated or whatever, and they assume because of what they have seen that it’s a purely artistic thing, it’s a fashion thing only to do with style. I can’t get to a solution from that beginning, so I start entirely from the point of view of, can I make the use of the thing better. Eventually, by some extraordinary piece of good fortune, I wind up with a style that they think is terrific and how it got there they are not interested. It does become interesting when we then start to develop it because I find I’m defending bits of the mechanical process and they don’t want me to, particularly the engineers don’t want me to!\n\nHe says he always has a concern with ‘the nitty-gritty’ of products and their use, including not only their primary function but also\n\n71",

There has been a temptation, he says, for some designers ‘to scorn the elements of style, fashion and pleasure. That, in my view, is the road to righteous boredom’. His view is that ‘Design should solve a problem, work well, last, and, of course, look good’.\n\nIn addition to this personal commitment, however, he frequently refers to the ‘happy accidents’ that seem to have dominated his career.\n\nI keep saying accident, but it is – I happen to be on the scene when people need a particular skill, and I am of the good fortune to be on the doorstep, passing the front door when that particular skill is needed. An example of this casualness, as I call it, is in both the train and in the design I did for the Chef [the Kenwood Chef food mixer – one of Kenneth’s earliest and most well-known designs, Figure 3.7], which eventually led me to 35 years of working with Kenwood. I got the job of designing the Chef because I said I’d do it in three days, and my fee was probably the lowest of the three people they were talking to. And the casualness, by which the thing was accepted, and then goes into production, and my whole life opens up, is that with only three days in which to do it, and the only method I knew, because I’d never had any training as a designer, although a good draughtsman I’d never had any of the skilful training about presentation drawing, so I wasn’t good at flashy drawings and things and I did everything with model making, every single thing I did with model making because I could do it, personally do it. But I didn’t have enough time, I only had time enough to make half a model, just could not make a whole model, so I made a half and I took a mirror with me [to place alongside to give the effect of seeing the symmetrical whole]. Now, it wasn’t artifice on my part, at least it wasn’t a trick, it was just a practical way of showing them a whole thing with half the effort. Kenneth Wood [the company owner] loved it, and I think he loved it because he thought it was salesmanship. For me, it was a pure bit of good luck.",

Although their examples stem from very different domains of design – Formula One, city car, sewing machine, locomotive – the two designers can be seen to have similarities in their approaches. Some of these similarities seem to stem from their backgrounds and personalities, and they obviously share personal, highly motivated attitudes towards their work and the achievement of success. I will compare their approaches with those of other successful designers and offer an overview of the strategic thinking practices that appear to be common to these designers. I will also introduce some other studies that focus on the nature of creative thinking in design.\n\nMotivation and attitude\n\nGordon Murray thinks that innovative design, certainly in motor racing, starts with ‘a certain type of person’, like himself, who has a strong desire to beat the opposition: ‘All you want to do is go back next time and blow them all into the weeds.’ Not all racing car designers are like that, he agrees, but he has always had that strong competitive urge. The strength of his personal motivation cannot be doubted; it would have been essential to carry him through so many innovations, through failures as well as successes, in such a highly",

He has also had a strong personal interest and practical involvement in motor racing and car design throughout his life, including designing, building and racing his own sports car as a young man. The novel three-seat driver/passengers layout of the McLaren F1, used again in the city car, in which the driver is central and two passengers are side by side slightly behind the driver, is something that appeared in his design sketchbooks as a young man, and he says that other ideas are still there in his various sketchbooks waiting for an opportunity to be realized.\n\nKenneth Grange’s approach to design also seems to be rooted in his early experiences of ‘learning by doing’ – of learning to take apart and re-assemble artillery mechanisms so that he could make the drawings that would explain to someone else how to do it. Another relevant aspect of his time in the Army, he believes, was that it helped develop his physical health and strength, which he regards as a key to the hard work and long hours he later put into building and running his design practice. This physical aptitude is part of the strength of leadership, he believes:\n\nI think a large part of the ability of any team to achieve anything is a mixture of resources – obviously intellectual resource is a very important part, but then there are resources which are simply to do with whether you can stay awake, and stay awake at a keen, high, top level of concentration. So I think inevitably there’s a question of teams following the physical and behavioural examples of the leader.\n\nKenneth also has strong personal motivation and what he calls an ‘I can do it’ attitude: ‘I think there’s a bit of me that is a commercial animal I suppose, a bit of me that’s certainly an “I can do it” man, under any circumstances. I always say yes, and of course it gets me into trouble!’ This personal commitment also helps in the leadership of his design teams, he believes. ‘I think that’s what builds the team; they know back at the ranch that this man Grange is out there saying, “Yes we can do it tomorrow”!’\n\nAs chief designer, it seems necessary to have a lot of self-confidence to carry through new ideas in a highly pressured environment. It involves taking risk and shouldering a lot of responsibility. Gordon",

      "content": "HOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\nMurray finds that this personal responsibility naturally brings intense psychological pressure: ‘There are patches of loneliness really, when you sit there and think, I’m committing all next year’s budget, there are all the mechanics relying on me, all the team, all the sponsors, all the drivers, friends, family – I mean, the car’s got to go well, and I’m committed to this loony idea, you know?’ Even he admits to feeling sometimes very nervous about the risks he was taking: ‘Occasionally you wake up in the night and think, phew, maybe I’ll do a normal car!’ But for him, that risk-taking is the difference between the innovative and non-innovative designer. The speed and pressure and commitment of racing car design are such that adrenalin and an almost physical exhilaration kept him going: ‘It’s like surfing on top of a wave, and you know you can’t get off.’ It’s clear that he also carried this attitude through into designing the city car, self-imposing the pressure to produce a radical new concept of personal transport.\n\nIn explaining his approach to innovative design, Gordon Murray stresses the need constantly to work from ‘first principles’. In Formula One racing, he was often surprised to find that other teams were not taking such a basic approach and that they would frequently merely copy the successful innovations of someone else. Working from first principles and working in a highly organized way seem to come naturally to him, but his personal design process is much less structured than the results might suggest. Although he can tightly organize his team and run a complex racing organization, his personal ways of designing are relatively unstructured, based on annotated, thumb-nail sketches. ‘I don’t sit down and say, OK, now I’ve had the idea, let’s see, this is a solution, these are the different ways to go, if I do this, and do that; I do lots of scribbles just to save it, before I forget.’\n\nFor Kenneth Grange, his innovative design work often stems from going beyond the original brief, and that experience helped form his sceptical attitude towards developing and following a tight initial specification. The designer’s job, he says, is ‘to produce the unexpected’. And that does not happen by trying to ‘get the brief right, go through the process in an orderly fashion, check that you have done what you have been told to do’. Instead, ‘It’s the little bits of inspiration, the little sort of byways and the unlikely analogies and things that eventually produce what you recognise as being the right\n\n77",

Success lies in finding the chinks in the specifications and reaching through to the concealed plums.’\n\nIt is as though his ability is primarily perceptual, a way of seeing; not something that he has to work and worry at until he gets an idea, and not something that emerges in the process of designing so much as the process of initial problem formulation. He agrees with this interpretation: ‘You do have to ferret around, which is like an intellectual bit of it, to see, to find that which is then suddenly obvious to you, and I think that has happened very often. Sometimes you almost have to fabricate the problem.’ He reinterprets, or brings a fresh perception to the design problem so as to prompt a new concept, and the rest is working this through; the perceptive insight gives ‘a direction, and then it’s a question of tuning’.\n\nTheir adoption of first principles is one way that helps these designers repel the enemy of creative thinking – fixation on standard solutions or conventional ways of doing things. They maintain a constructive discontent with the way things are and keep the experience of standard practices at the back of their minds, not the front.\n\nOther outstanding designers\n\nThese two case studies also reinforce and resonate with many of the observations that have been made in other studies of successful, innovative designers and extend even further across the range of fields of design in which they practice.\n\nIn Chapter 1, I drew upon the interviews that Bryan Lawson conducted with some highly successful, creative architects. He drew attention to similarities in the working methods of the architects he studied, which also have similarities with the engineering designer Gordon Murray and the industrial designer Kenneth Grange. One such is the need to maintain periods of intense activity but interspersed with periods, usually away from the normal work environment, of more reflective contemplation. Lawson’s architects also are characterized by a dedicated sense of purpose, which they share with small, highly motivated teams of co-workers.",

      "content": "HOW DESIGNERS THINK\n\nOne thing that emerges strongly from Lawson’s studies that resonates with the study of Gordon Murray is the architects’ use of drawing as a design aid. Lawson observed that, ‘Frequently, drawings are overlaid and mixed together. Two-dimensional plans or sections can be seen with sketches and more diagrammatic marks all on the same piece of paper in what appears a confusing jumble’. These sound very much like Gordon Murray’s ‘Wonder Plots’. The architects also use their drawings as a means of ‘thinking aloud’, or ‘talking to themselves’, as Gordon put it. For example, as the architect Richard MacCormac said, ‘I use drawing as a process of criticism and discovery’, which sounds very similar to Gordon’s approach. The common elements in these similar approaches are the use of drawing as a means not only of externalizing cognitive images but also of actively ‘thinking by drawing’ and of responding, layer after layer and view after view, to the design as it emerges in the drawings. Another study of an innovative designer, by Linda Candy and Ernest Edmonds, is particularly relevant because, like the study of Gordon Murray, it was also based upon the design of race-winning competition vehicles. Candy and Edmonds studied the design process of the racing-bicycle designer, Mike Burrows. His innovative, carbon-fibre, single-piece ‘monocoque’ frame design of 1985 was at first banned by the cycle racing authorities as illegal, but later became the basis of the LotusSport Olympic pursuit bicycle on which Chris Boardman won the 4,000 metres individual pursuit race in world record time at the 1992 Olympic Games (Figure 4.1). Interestingly, as well as working outside or around the regulations, there are many features of Mike Burrows’s design approach that are similar to that of Gordon Murray.\n\nLike Gordon Murray, Mike Burrows is an enthusiast for his sport and has participated as a racing cyclist. They both therefore have a very high personal motivation that drives their work, and both are steeped in the knowledge and expertise of their domains. They both constantly keep abreast of progress and current developments in their own and related fields, simply out of personal commitment, and this can often lead to insights and the transfer of technology from one field to another. A significant difference in working methods, however, is Mike Burrows’s limited use of sketching as a design medium; he prefers to move quickly to immediate physical realizations of ideas in models and mock- ups. This is rather more like Kenneth Grange’s approach of building\n\n79",

Nevertheless, his approach to arriving at the ‘monocoque’ cycle design reflects Gordon Murray’s approach of concentrating on a major objective and designing from first principles. In Mike Burrows’s case it was a concentration on pursuing the dominant goal of going faster, which meant minimizing aerodynamic drag. He said, ‘You only knew what the goal was – how fast can you go. You knew you solved that by making it more streamlined. To be very fast, you have to be aerodynamic.’ Single-minded concentration on that goal made Burrows prepared to completely re-conceptualize the conventional bicycle frame. Candy and Edmonds described the resulting design as ‘an integrated holistic design in which all the individual components contributed to the main goal of achieving maximum aerodynamic efficiency’. They suggested that ‘Taking a higher level view of the problem space proved to be a critical change that enabled him to step outside the existing constraints and dare to be radically different’.\n\nRobin Roy interviewed the industrial designer James Dyson, who reported that he almost never solved problems by getting ‘brainwaves in the bath’, but more often when doing some practical work, ‘welding",

Two of James Dyson’s most well-known design innovations, the Ballbarrow wheelbarrow, which has a large, ball-shaped wheel to improve handling, and the Cyclone bag-less vacuum cleaner (one model of which is shown in Chapter 2, Figure 2.7), which collects dust in a container by means of a centrifugal cyclone effect. Both of these innovations came from practical experience and from drawing on technology transfer from other fields. The Ballbarrow drew from his experience with balloon tyres on amphibious vehicles, and the Cyclone drew from his installation of an industrial extract cyclone to remove fine powder from the air of the factory where the Ballbarrow was being produced. Roy suggested that, for James Dyson, creative design and innovation ‘is a matter of having good ideas based on experience and careful observation of the real world, followed by hard work involving practical skills, technical expertise and design ability to convert that idea into a marketable product’.\n\nA broader study of several highly innovative engineers was made by Michael Maccoby, based on interviews with eight such people, nominated by their peers. Maccoby identified the life- long commitment of the innovators he studied, extending back to examples of interests stemming from their childhood or youth; the fact that innovators are not put off by failure, but expect to learn from failure; and that they have ‘the courage to innovate’. He also pointed to several examples amongst these innovators of their experience of solutions arising from sudden illumination of problems that they had been worrying about. For example, the engineer-inventor Jacob Rabinow reported that ‘flashes of inspiration come to him while shaving, driving, or partaking in other activities. Solutions are usually sudden’. Not all the innovators reported examples of sudden illumination, and for some, solutions only come from continuous hard work, but it is clear that sudden illumination (within a well-prepared mind) is a frequent element in creative design thinking.\n\nCommon features\n\nThere appear to be sufficient striking similarities between these various studies of creative designers and other innovators for us\n\n81",

We see in particular the immensely strong commitment of the innovative designer to their chosen field of endeavour, based on a personal motivation that has been within them since youth. Added to this is a personal courage to take risks, even in the face of huge consequences for failure. The innovative designer is prepared to fail (occasionally) but is not afraid of failure and of course seeks fanatically to avoid failure.\n\nBeyond these personality characteristics, there are some useful observations to be made about the methods and approaches adopted by successful, innovative designers and which might perhaps to some extent be transferable to others. A key aspect of the approach lies in defining or framing the problem to be solved, which is not always the same as ‘the problem as given’. The goal is set at a high level, with clear objectives and in direct terms which might even seem to be simplistic. It is this simple clarity which might make other people conclude that the goal is simply impossible. There is a holistic, systems view of the problem encapsulated in the goal. A clear concept of how to reach this goal is devised, sometimes by means of a sudden insight which comes when relaxing after deep immersion in the problem, and the solution details then cascade from the concept. Intense work is needed to develop, evaluate and refine the solution details; creativity is still ‘1% inspiration and 99% perspiration’. The clear, generative concept is not simply ‘found’ in the problem as given, but largely created by the designer; it is a matter not of recognizing a pre-existing pattern in the data but of creating a pattern that re-formulates the problem and suggests directions towards a solution.\n\nThis approach seems to require, or is synergistic with, a particular style of working. Some aspects of this style arise from the innovative designer’s personality characteristics – for instance, their personal motivation means that they are steeped in their chosen domain, and they are prepared when necessary to work obsessively at their chosen problem and solution. The working style is based on periods of intense activity, coupled with other periods of more relaxed, reflective contemplation. This working style may not be a reflection of a particular personality trait but a necessary aspect of creative work, which requires alternating intense effort with relaxation. The",

An important feature of their strategy is parallel working – keeping design activity going at many levels simultaneously. The best cognitive aid for supporting and maintaining parallel design thinking seems to be drawing. Drawing with conventional tools of paper and pencil gives the flexibility to shift levels of detail instantaneously; allows partial, different views at different levels of detail to be developed side by side or above and below and overlapping; keeps a record of previous views, ideas and notes that can be accessed relatively quickly and inserted into the current frame of reference; and permits and encourages the simultaneous, non-hierarchical participation of co-workers, using a common representation. The drawing of conjectures, partial solutions or representations also aids the designer’s thinking processes, and provides a form of interactive ‘talk-back’. As well as drawing, innovative designers frequently like to undertake practical work related to the design solution, such as building models or mock-ups, or participating in construction.\n\nStrategic thinking\n\nThree key strategic aspects of design thinking appear to be common across all these studies: (1) taking a broad systems approach to the given problem, rather than accepting narrow problem criteria (system design and going beyond the brief); (2) framing the problem in a distinctive and sometimes rather personal way (creating a focused viewpoint on critical or potentially promising aspects); and (3) designing from first principles (using the framing to identify and employ relevant fundamental knowledge).\n\nFirst, there is the systems approach adopted by innovative designers. From his studies of innovators, Maccoby suggested that ‘The innovator has a systems mind, one that sees things in\n\n83",

This sounds similar to the approaches adopted by Gordon Murray and Kenneth Grange. Maccoby continued with an example which might almost be describing Murray’s approach: ‘For example, one can think about a car in terms of all its parts working together to make it go . . . In contrast, most engineers do not think in systems terms. They are concerned about designing a good piece-part, like a clutch.’ This sounds like Gordon Murray describing how his approach is different from conventional, piece-focused, engineering design. It also sounds similar to the approach adopted by Kenneth Grange, in his re-perceptions of the problem as given, usually from the user’s point of view, and considering the user’s overall task for which the product is being designed. This systems approach is evident, for example, in the way he designed the Frister & Rossman sewing machine so as to facilitate the whole process of sewing and the maintenance of the machine. Gordon Murray’s introduction of pit stops also illustrates how a total systems approach was adopted – a focus not just on the design of the car but on the larger picture of winning the race.\n\nSecond, the designers appear to explore the problem from a particular perspective, in order to formulate or frame the problem in a way that stimulates and pre-structures the emergence of design concepts. In some cases, this perspective is a personal one that they seem to bring to most of their designing; for example, Kenneth Grange has a strong, emotional distaste for what he considers to be ‘contradictions’ in design, where the object is not well-adapted to its user and the patterns of use. As he said, ‘My attitude is to want it to be a pleasure to operate.’ And it was from operating the sewing machine that the new concept of an asymmetrical layout emerged, and the rounded edges, which gave the clients the re-styling that they wanted. In the case of the design of an auto-variable suspension system, Gordon Murray’s problem frame was governed by his focus on ‘How the hell can we get ground effect back?’ in order to achieve his goal of the fastest car, whilst satisfying the constraints set by the regulations. For these designers, therefore, their framing arises from the requirements of the particular design situation, but is strongly influenced by their personal motivations, whether they may be",

For example, Gordon Murray stresses the need to ‘keep looking at fundamental physical principles’ for innovative design and in his design to regain ground effect he focused on the physical forces that act on a car at speed. Also we saw in his city car design work that fundamental principles in details such as suspension and in manufacturing were part of his thinking from the very beginning. Kenneth Grange is less explicit about first principles, but it seems clear that he adheres to the modernist design principle of ‘form follows function’; he approaches design problems ‘by trying to sort out just the functionality, just the handling of it, and by-and-large out of that comes a direction’. This approach is evident in the examples of his product designs, which are based very much on the ‘first principles’ of function and usability. It was also evident in his design of the HST, which he based on aerodynamic analysis. In both the big HST and the little sewing machine he questioned the established, underlying, standard engineering ‘requirements’ that had dominated the previous solutions.\n\nFinally, it seems from these examples that innovative design arises especially when there is a conflict to be resolved between the (designer’s) high-level problem goals and the (client’s) criteria for an acceptable solution. Creativity is often stimulated when there is a conflict to resolve, and it may be that these successful designers recognize this and seek the stimulus of conflict. Such conflict is particularly evident in Gordon Murray’s design strategy in Formula One, which was to challenge and, if necessary, somehow to legally circumvent the criteria set by the technical regulations. In Kenneth Grange’s case, the potential conflict is often with the client’s criteria for a product re-styling job, whereas his goal is to provide the product’s user with an enhanced affordance of use from the product. As he said, ‘You are almost invariably brought in by somebody who has got a very elementary commercial motive . . . It’s extremely unusual to be brought in to approach it from this usability, this function theme.’ And yet, of course, the client’s criteria still have to be satisfied.\n\n85",

At the intermediate level, the designer frames the problem in a personal way and develops a solution concept both to match that frame and to satisfy the criteria. The designer applies that problem frame at the lower level, in order to identify and draw upon first principles of physics, engineering and design that help to bridge between the problem frame and a solution concept.\n\nAt the lowest level is explicit, established knowledge of first principles, which may be domain-specific or more general scientific knowledge. At the intermediate level is where the designer’s strategic knowledge is especially exercised and where that knowledge is more variable, situated in the particular problem and its context, tacit and perhaps personalized and idiosyncratic. At the higher level there is a mix of relatively stable, but usually implicit goals held by the designer, the temporary problem goals and explicit solution criteria specified by the client or other domain authority.\n\nCreative thinking\n\nSo far, we have been looking at how highly successful, innovative designers think and work, especially focusing on how their creative",

Our evidence so far has come from interview studies, but there are also some experimental studies that have focused on the normal episodes of creativity in designing. In one such study, Kees Dorst asked nine experienced, practising industrial designers to each work on the same design problem and to ‘think aloud’ about what they were doing. (We will see more of these kinds of studies in the next two chapters.)\n\nThe problem assignment that Dorst set for the designers was to create a concept for a ‘litter disposal system’ to be provided in a new train in the Netherlands. The client for this project was a plastics products company which already made litter bins, and so that was a major influence on the designers’ approach to the problem brief. The nine concepts that the designers produced were all different but were all essentially variants of a litter bin.\n\nThe designers were asked to complete the assignment within two and a half hours. They were given a design briefing document and they could also access a file of relevant information sheets which included aspects such as interviews with the client, technical information about materials and production techniques and surveys that had been conducted of train users with respect to litter. The designers’ comments and actions as they worked were audio and video recorded for analysis.\n\nIn his analysis, Dorst noticed that all the designers exhibited the same kind of creative thinking insight into the problem and its solution. In the various information sheets that the designers could access, problems to do with the newspapers that people leave in trains occurred in several separate places, for example:\n\nnewspapers make up 40 per cent of the contents of the bins –\n\nthe largest single type of train litter\n\nsometimes the newspapers are left behind on the seats or\n\nluggage racks\n\nthe train cleaners complain about having to collect the\n\nscattered newspapers\n\nthe railway company wants to attain an environmentally\n\nfriendly image, and they are thinking about ways of recycling the waste collected in trains\n\n87",

These loose bits of information can be combined into the idea that newspapers should be collected separately from other litter. All nine designers had this idea, and all of them reported upon it as an original idea, a key concept in their solution. The designers were very enthusiastic about this idea. It was a real ‘aha!’ event for them.\n\nEach designer seemed to think that this was an original concept and indeed it was original in the sense that it was a different concept from the existing litter bin, and it was also original to each individual designer. All the designers took this idea as one of the key features in their subsequent design process, even though it led to a number of different designs. For instance, the system level on which they incorporated this idea in the end differed amongst designers: it is possible to consider the level of the whole train, a single railway carriage or just a compartment within a carriage as the scope of the design, or simply add a newspaper rack to a litter bin. For most designers, their product solution worked at a very local level (incorporating a specific newspaper container in the litter bin), whilst another designer included a newspaper rack to be placed at the end wall of each passenger compartment, and one designer made the collection of waste to be possible from outside of the train carriage.\n\nProblem framing\n\nThese designers’ identification of newspapers as a particular feature of the design problem, resulting in the design goal of ‘keeping newspapers separate’, is a typical example of problem framing by experienced designers. How did the designers come to their framing of the problem? They all appeared to have a similar strategy. With respect to the ‘keep newspapers separate’ idea, a common recognition emerged of a cluster of related information.

This process led them to an overview of the project (and of the priorities of the stakeholders) together with a collection of ‘interesting points’ – for instance, the designers were all seen to select and make a small stack of information sheets that interested them or make a list of these interesting items.\n\nAs I discussed in Chapter 1, Donald Schön characterized designing as ‘a reflective conversation with the situation’ which depends very much on acts of problem framing. According to Schön, ‘In order to formulate a design problem to be solved, the designer must frame a problematic design situation: set its boundaries, select particular things and relations for attention, and impose on the situation a coherence that guides subsequent moves.’ Schön suggested that the skilled, reflective practice of designers proceeds through acts of naming, framing, moving and reflecting. In the example of the litter bins, the designers selected features of the problem space to which they chose to attend (naming – ‘interesting’ or ‘surprising’ items of information), formed a specific scoping which they chose as a basis for exploration (framing – a focus on ‘keep newspapers separate’), generated ideas in the solution space (moving – partial solution conjectures), considered the possibilities and implications of those conjectures (reflecting) and proceeded to re-iterate until reaching a definitive design concept.\n\nKees Dorst used Schön’s reflective practice schema of naming- framing-moving-reflecting to analyse the data from his experiments, using the recordings of the designers’ ‘think aloud’ comments. An example of a section of the analysis of one designer is shown in Table 4.1. This thirty-minute section begins just before the designer has the ‘keep newspapers separate’ idea, whilst he is considering the train carriage wall as the location for a bin. He suddenly says, ‘Just had a flash – would it be good to make separate bins?’ Combining separate aspects of the problem together in this way to form a pattern is an example of emergence happening in the problem space. For this designer, and all the others, this emergent pattern became their initial problem frame.\n\nThe designer then refers back to the problem information on the types of litter and other aspects such as client preferences, use by passengers and cleaners, refines the ‘separate bins’ idea and then\n\n89",

This interactive process of discovery between problem and solution in designing has been characterized as a process of co-evolution.\n\nIn co-evolution terms, in the ‘keep newspapers separate’ insight, there is the recognition of a pattern of connections between some diverse but related information items that enables the designers to make a partial structuring of the problem space. That gives them a problem frame, and they use that to begin to construct a partial structuring of the solution space – that is a solution could be based around forms of container that keep the newspapers separate from the other litter. As the designer pursues that solution idea they uncover aspects or issues that direct them back into the problem space, which in turn leads to a re-structuring, and so the designer’s understanding of the problem and their conjecturing of a solution co-evolve (Figure 4.4). In this interpretation of design as a co-evolution of both solution and problem, the designer’s attention oscillates between the two, forming partial, related structurings of the problem and solution spaces, linked through framing. Dorst and Cross observed from this study:\n\nThe designers start by exploring the problem space, and find, discover, or recognise a partial structure. That partial structure is then used to provide them also with a partial structuring of the solution space. They consider the implications of the partial structure within the solution space, use it to generate some\n\n93",

They transfer the developed partial structure back into the problem space, and again consider implications and extend the structuring of the problem space. Their goal . . . is to create a matching problem-solution pair.\n\nThe identification of ‘a matching problem-solution pair’ is the creative act of cognition when a designer concludes: this is my understanding of the problem, and this is my matching proposal for its solution.\n\nThe co-evolutionary transfer of perceptions and insights between solution and problem spaces was also recorded by Masaki Suwa and his colleagues in their study of an experienced architect at work. They focused on the emergence of ‘unexpected discoveries’ during the design process – that is, instances when the designer perceived something ‘new’ or ‘interesting’ emerging in a previously drawn element of a solution concept – and noticed that these led to the generation of further issues or requirements within the design problem. They found a strong bi-directional correlation between unexpected discoveries in the developing solution and the elaboration of issues and requirements within the problem. The instances of unexpected discoveries were facilitated by the designer’s sketching: Suwa suggested that ‘drawing sketches, . . . perceiving visuo-spatial features in sketches, and conceiving of design issues or requirements are all dynamically coupled with each other’. The designer’s perception of emergent features in their solution ideas leads to reconsidering their understanding and defining of the problem.\n\nSo designers use solution conjectures as the means of developing their understanding or interpretation of the problem. Since the problem cannot be fully understood in isolation from consideration of its solution, it is natural that solution conjectures should be used as a means of helping to explore and understand the problem formulation. Solution conjectures often prompt the further consideration of problematic issues, and so the problem and solution co-evolve.\n\nStefan Wiltschnig and his colleagues extended the study of co-evolution from laboratory studies of individual designers into real- world team design processes. They studied a team of designers working on a project in medical product design, and found that co-evolution was significantly present in teamwork just as in individual work. They identified many episodes of co-evolution where team",

These episodes revealed close links between co-evolution and creative processes, and they concluded that ‘the evidence points to co-evolution episodes as being the creative engine of everyday design practice’.\n\nSummary\n\nOutstanding designers have strong motivation and commitment, often with deeply immersed personal backgrounds and extensive experience in their chosen fields. They have an attitude of constructive discontent, paying critical attention to existing designs to see and suggest how they could be improved. Their creative approach extends across all design levels, including detail design as well as broader conceptualization throughout the design process. An element of risk-taking and courage is necessary in innovative designing. Innovative design arises from challenging the given brief, the assumed constraints on what is achievable, and the influence of standard solutions. Focused, persistent work usually contributes more to creative insights than sudden, unexpected illumination. Innovative designers frame the given problem in a challenging way, forming high-level systems goals and drawing on fundamental technical first principles. Creative insights in design can feel highly personal to the individual but may be common across different designers approaching the same problem. The creative design process is one of co-evolution, developing problem and solution together: explorations of possible solutions lead back to reconsidering the problem.\n\nSources\n\nFull citations are given in the References.\n\nLinda Candy and Ernest Edmonds: Creative design of the Lotus\n\nbicycle, Design Studies.\n\n95",

The next two case studies are derived from these types of experiments.\n\nThis case study is of the expert, highly skilled and very experienced American engineer Victor Scheinman, who agreed to act as the participant in a protocol study. Victor had been a pioneer in designing modern robotic devices and won several awards from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for his work in the design of mechanical and electro-mechanical machines – an accomplished engineering designer, outstanding in his field.

One of the most direct ways in which we can try to know what is going on inside people’s heads is by asking them to tell us what they are thinking. Of course, this is fraught with difficulties. People do not necessarily know what is going on inside their own heads, let alone have the ability to verbalize it. Also, there may well be side effects of the verbalization, such that it actually changes the participant’s behaviour and their cognitive performance. Or the participant may, quite unintentionally, give irrelevant accounts, reporting parallel but independent thoughts to those that are actually being employed in the task. These disadvantages weigh particularly heavily on the validity of protocol analysis in studying design thinking, where non-verbal processes are a significant feature of the relevant cognitive activities and where the use of sketches and similar externalization of thought processes seem to be fundamental.\n\nNevertheless, people do normally find it relatively straightforward to give a verbal account of what they believe they are thinking or what they were thinking recently. Retrospective verbal accounts (i.e. recalling what one was thinking recently) offer one means of getting at cognitive activity which is frequently used not only in research but also in everyday interchanges, such as ‘What were you thinking when you were doing that?’ Concurrent verbal accounts (i.e. ‘thinking aloud’) offer the researcher the hope that they really do externalize – or allow insight into – at least some of the participants’ cognitive activities. Of all the empirical, observational research methods for the analysis of design activity, protocol analysis is the one that has received the most attention and application. It has become regarded as the most likely method to bring out into the open, at least to some extent, the somewhat mysterious skills of design thinking.\n\nFor this study, Victor Scheinman was invited to participate in a research project into design thinking. He was told that the research would involve him undertaking a short (two-hour) design exercise, within the engineering product design domain. The experiment was conducted in a design project room supplied with table and chair, drawing pad, pens and pencils and whiteboard, and equipped",

In the last one and a half years, this European activity has suffered some setbacks in the market; in Europe internal- frame backpacks are gaining a larger and larger market share.\n\nAs a response, HiAdventure has hired a marketing firm to look for new trends and opportunities for the European market. On the basis of this marketing report, HiAdventure has decided to develop an accessory for the HiStar:\n\nA special carrying/fastening device that would enable you to fasten and carry the backpack on mountain bikes.\n\nThe device would have to fit on most touring and mountain bikes, and should fold down, or at any rate be stacked away easily. A quick survey has shown that there is nothing like this on the European market.\n\nThis idea is particularly interesting for HiAdventure, because the director, Mr Christiansen, has a long-standing private association with one of the chief product managers at the Batavus bicycle company (one of the larger bicycle manufacturers in northern Europe, based in Holland). Mr Christiansen sees this as a good opportunity to strike up a cooperation and to profit from the European marketing capabilities of Batavus.\n\nThe Batavus product manager, Mr Lemmens, is very enthusiastic about putting a combination-product on the market, a mountain bike and a backpack that can be fastened to it. The idea is to base the combination-product on the Batavus Buster (a midrange mountain bike), and to sell it under the name Batavus HikeStar.\n\nThe design department at Batavus has made a preliminary design for the carrying/fastening device, but both Mr Christiansen and Mr Lemmens are not very content with it.

I happen to know that the Blackburn company is local, so I will call them up.\n\nVictor telephoned the company and said that he was seeking advice about what sort of bicycle luggage carriers he should use for carrying a backpack on a mountain bike.

This is a different situation to that of everyday, smooth-surface, level-grade riding, and it accentuates the need to position the backpack low and to the rear. The view that Victor had of the design task was significantly different from a view that might be formed from considering the bicycle and backpack in a static situation, or without considering the effects on the rider’s ability to control the bicycle with a mounted backpack. Victor’s understanding of the dynamic situation therefore enabled him to formulate a broad view of the design task.\n\nFrom this overview of the total dynamic system of rider + bicycle + backpack, Victor identified stability as a key issue, and framed the problem as ‘how to maintain stability’. Given that a heavy backpack had to be carried over the rear wheel of the bicycle, and given his experience of the ‘wobbling’ that can occur in the riding situation, this problem framing and his prior experience led him to conclude that he must design a rigid carrying device:\n\n(00:59) The biggest thing that I remember in backpack mounting is that it’s got to be rigid, very rigid.\n\nHe then developed this viewpoint into the requirement that the structural members of any carrying device must be stiff:",

Having established a need for rigidity, Victor was able to utilize his knowledge of structural engineering principles as he developed a concept design for the carrying device – in particular, knowledge that a triangulated structure is inherently rigid. At this time, Victor began to develop his design concept through a series of drawings, shown in Figures 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4.\n\nWhilst sketching a rear view of the basic position and layout for\n\nthe device (Figure 5.2), Victor commented:\n\n(01:07) One of the problems with a bicycle carrier where the frame is mounted out here and it goes to that, is that you end up with a parallelogram – bad thing, bad thing!\n\nHis knowledge of structural design principles led him to avoid designing a rectangular, parallelogram structure, which was the form that rather naturally seemed to arise from considering the basic shape of the carrier and the location of its supporting structure on the bicycle. Here we can see that Victor, like other designers, is using the act of drawing as ‘a process of criticism and discovery’.\n\nHe expanded on this critical comment, emphasizing his concern\n\nwith stability as a key requirement:\n\n(01:08) If I were to make a frame that looked like this, that would be a very poor design because basically what I’ve got is, I’ve got a parallelogram which has very little lateral stability.\n\nHe then drew a triangular form onto the layout, introducing the structural design principle of triangulation, which offers inherent stiffness:\n\n103",

Like Kenneth Grange, Victor knew that it is important to satisfy the client who has commissioned the project, as well as to please the potential users of a product. In this project, the client for the design task was a manufacturer who wanted to sell the carrying device in conjunction with their already-existing backpack. The device therefore needed to have unique, positive features that differentiated it from other, similar products. During the development of his design concept, Victor kept in mind that he needed the product to have a ‘proprietary feature’. He used the client’s requirement of a unique selling proposition to help guide and reinforce his decision to seek a design based on triangular structures:\n\n(01:10) That is going to be our proprietary feature, a triangular, rigid structure with no bends in it; these rods are then going to be in tension and compression, no bending.\n\n105",

In his comments, Victor demonstrated that he regarded the pronounced triangular form at the rear of the carrier as something to be retained as a feature that would help give the product an attractive and distinctive appearance. His design for the carrying device was therefore based on an integrated concept in which user requirements are addressed through the problem frame of stability, leading to the use of triangularity as the guiding first principle, which he then also used to address the client’s goal of having a proprietary, unique selling feature to the product.\n\nDiscussion: Design strategy\n\nHaving the benefit of a ‘think aloud’ transcript, we can see that Victor’s creative process has similarities with the earlier example of designers in a similar experiment, designing a litter bin.

Also, like other designers discussed earlier, his thinking involves working simultaneously across several different levels of generality and detail.\n\nHis strategy included forming a broad, system’s view of the required product in its situation; from that, developing a particular perspective or frame for guiding the solution concept; using that framing to identify relevant first principles of engineering design to embody the concept; and also maintaining in mind the satisfaction of the client’s goal of a commercially successful consumer product. This strategy seems remarkably similar to that identified as common in the case studies of expert designers Gordon Murray and Kenneth Grange.\n\nFirst, all three designers develop a broad, high-level, systems view of the problem that they are given, in many senses ‘going beyond’ the basic problem and its initial narrow criteria. For Victor Scheinman the broader view was that of the whole situation of using the product, of the dynamic system of rider + bicycle + backpack.\n\nSecond, all three designers explore the problem and formulate a particular perspective in order to frame the problem in a way that stimulates and helps to structure the emergence of design concepts. Victor Scheinman used a distinct usability perspective in his problem structuring for the backpack carrier, for which, like Kenneth Grange and the sewing machine, he drew upon his personal experience of using such a device.\n\nThird, all three designers use the problem-solution framing to identify basic design principles that trigger the origination of their concepts and assist in the detailed development of those concepts. For Victor, it soon emerged that ‘bicycle stability’s an issue’, and so ‘it’s got to be rigid, very rigid.’ Victor then relied strongly on the basic structural principle of triangulation to achieve the rigidity and stiffness that he considered important in the design of the backpack carrier. This led him to the triangularity of his design concept, which he then used to establish a distinctive appearance for the product, to satisfy the client’s need for a unique selling feature. Victor’s design concept integrated the user’s need for a stable, rigid product with the client’s commercial need for a product that had some distinctive marketing feature. As in the sewing machine example we also see here an example of how the designer’s personal framing and use of",

Victor Scheinman’s design process therefore seems to fit with the pattern and model of strategic thinking of expert designers identified in Chapter 4 (Figure 4.2). It is perhaps surprising that there appear to be such major commonalities between the case studies we have examined, which vary across real-world accounts and experimental observations, as well as across very different design domains, from Formula One racing cars to bicycle backpack carriers. Perhaps this also does suggest that there are indeed some underlying, fundamental aspects that reveal the nature and skill of expert design thinking.\n\n109",

In this experiment, a small team of three designers tackled the same design problem as did Victor Scheinman in the previous one, a carrying/fastening device for transporting a hiker’s backpack on a mountain bicycle and in the same two-hour experiment situation. However, this was not a ‘think-aloud’ protocol study, but all the team’s actions and natural conversation verbalizations were recorded for analysis. Because it involves teamwork, the design process in this case study has some significant differences from the previous study. Teamwork is of considerable importance in normal professional design activity and has become of even greater importance as design becomes a more integrated and inclusive activity involving collaboration amongst many different professions, and extended into co-designing with other project stakeholders such as clients and potential end-users. Understanding how design thinking operates in a teamwork context is therefore fundamental. The team in this study were three experienced product designers from the California office of the international, renowned design consultancy IDEO, who volunteered to participate in the experiment.\n\nTeamwork in design\n\nWorking as a member of a team introduces different problems and possibilities for the designer, in comparison with working alone.

In a normal work situation, some of these roles and relationships may be formally established; for instance, there may be seniorities of position established within the team, there may be a team leader appointed by a higher authority within the organization and there may be particular job roles or specialisms.\n\nWhether working alone or in a team, it would seem necessary to have to plan one’s activities to fit within the available time. This may be easier for an individual than for a team, but in fact explicit planning of activities is not always evident in either individual or teamwork. Furthermore, it seems to be necessary in design for unplanned, ad hoc exploratory activities to be pursued when they are perceived as relevant by the designer. This particular team did explicitly plan its activities, but if unplanned, exploratory activities are a normal feature of design activity, it becomes interesting to see how planned and unplanned actions are handled within a team.\n\nAs we have seen, it is also normal, indeed necessary, in design to interpret and re-formulate the problem given as the task. The nature of design problems means that analysing and understanding the problem is an influential part of the design process. Individual designers can form their own, possibly idiosyncratic interpretation of the problem, but a team has to reach some shared or commonly held understanding of the problem.\n\nFurthermore, in any design task, information relevant to the task has to be gathered from a variety of sources. A particular feature of the experiment design of this study was that a file of information on aspects of the problem was held by the experimenter, with relevant segments to be given to the designers if and when they asked for particular information. This helped to make explicit and observable some aspects of the necessary gathering and sharing of information that any team would have to undertake.\n\nSince a design task also means that the goal is to produce a design proposal, it is necessary to generate some ideas or concepts for what that proposal might be. An advantage of teamwork over individual work might be that a greater number and variety of concepts are generated. Again, in teamwork it will be necessary to communicate and share such concepts and ideas. It will be interesting to see how",

Different interpretations or understandings of the problem may become evident, and different design concepts may be favoured by different members of the team. An inevitable part of design teamwork would therefore seem to be identifying, avoiding and resolving conflicts.\n\nThese aspects of teamwork will be considered here in the context of the experimental study, drawing on examples of how these issues became manifest in the team’s design activities.\n\nRoles and relationships\n\nWe do not know the normal working background of the team members of this experiment (identified anonymously as I: ‘Ivan’, J: ‘John’ and K: ‘Kerry’). We do know that they all worked for the same design consultancy firm, each had several years of previous design experience, and had similar job roles within their firm. We can assume that they were all approximately equal in the hierarchy of their normal work situation, and that there were no pre-determined roles that they brought with them to the experimental session. However, it became clear from the video recording that different roles within the team were implicitly adopted, and some of this role-adoption became semi-formalized. Some other potential role-adoption behaviour was not acknowledged and formalized within the team. Informal role- adoption is evident through repeated patterns of behaviour or types of comments by an individual.\n\nThis can be illustrated by just a few examples of the ways roles and relationships were established and played within the team, and influenced what happened. For example, immediately after the initial reading of the brief, Kerry suggested that they begin by reviewing the design of the existing prototype:\n\nK: What do we need? I guess we should look at their existing\n\nprototype, huh?\n\n113",

Then, during the problem quantifying activity, Kerry suggested that gathering information from a user evaluation report of a preliminary design would be a useful activity:\n\nK: They’re not pleased with it so far, and the users’ tests have some – in fact it would be nice if we could see those users’ tests to see what the shortcomings were.\n\nShortly after, during a time-scheduling activity, Ivan mentioned the use of ‘information’ in the context of refining initial concepts. At this, Kerry again suggested that the user evaluation report might be a source of useful information, and again, this suggestion was not acted upon and was dismissed as irrelevant to the task in hand:\n\nI: Information or K: Yeah we wanna look at the em customer feedback or the users’\n\ntesting\n\nJ: Oh, yeah, so maybe, yeah, wherever that comes in, in this list\n\nAfter the ‘problem quantifying’ discussion, Ivan suggested that they should prepare a process and time schedule, and John and Ivan proceeded to do this.

These examples demonstrate some of the patterns of roles and relationships within the team that were evident throughout the session. However, these roles and relationships were not always fixed and simple. For instance, each member at times took a leadership role, although playing that role in a personal style. It seems inevitable that different ‘role playing’ behaviours will emerge in any team activity, depending on personality, experience and the task in hand, and it seems that team members could be more sensitive to each other’s preferences.\n\nPlanning and changing activities\n\nWithin the team there was a consciousness of planning the design process; members of the team were particularly aware of planning their activities and of keeping their activities to a schedule. This may seem like normal procedure for a team, but in fact not all teams in similar situations construct such an explicit procedure as this team did.

However, this creates difficulties in teamwork, where activities need to be coordinated, and an opportunistic deviation initiated by one member may be seen as irrelevant by another. In the analysis here we can observe how this team dealt with these aspects of both adhering to and deviating from planned activities.\n\nExplicit planning of the design process was initiated when Ivan suggested that the team should prepare a schedule of activities, rather than just pursuing unplanned activities. Ivan and John then proceeded to list the following design procedure (Figure 6.1):\n\nQuantify the problem Generate concepts Refine concepts Select a concept Design Present\n\nThis procedure seems to be derived from conventional models of a design process. Ivan and John seemed to share a view that this is an appropriate design process to adopt, and this process was in fact broadly followed through the rest of the session.\n\nAs noted earlier, Ivan seemed to ‘volunteer’ as the scheduler, and at important points he would draw attention to schedule and time, for example:\n\nI: We have to start making decisions, we’re already at five-fifteen\n\nAnd towards the end of the session Ivan kept the time pressure on the others; for example:\n\nI: OK um keep moving along, we have fifteen minutes to finish\n\nour design\n\nIvan’s role of scheduler/timekeeper appeared to be important to the progress of the team and having a plan for their design process meant",

Nothing prior was said: there appeared to be a tacit agreement between Ivan and Kerry that they would work directly with the bike and the backpack at this point. They rather ignored John, who concluded reading and then went to join the others at the bike, and immediately entered into the activity.\n\nJohn sat astride the bike and began to talk about placing the backpack within the central open space of the bike frame. Kerry pointed out the impracticality of that; instead, she again held the backpack in position behind the saddle. John then suggested positioning it in front of the handlebars. Ivan began to record these suggestions on the whiteboard (Figure 6.2). The team had now entered upon an activity of considering alternative mounting positions for the backpack, but there was no overt decision made to adopt that activity.\n\nOne form of opportunistic deviation from a plan is a serendipitous shift of attention. For example, during discussion of weights (of the backpack and of the product that is to be designed), Kerry asked for\n\nFIGURE team’s early ‘concepts-positions’ list.

But when this information was made available, it became more interesting as a source of design ideas, as Kerry indicated the structure of one of the existing products and Ivan realized the implication:\n\nK: This looks a lot like the little backpack frame doesn’t it? I: Yeah; you see we’ve been, it seems like mentally trying to just, because of a similarity in size and shape between the two, thinking of ways to use the same product for the same thing but I dunno that we necessarily – I mean we’re on a target for fiftyfive dollars, I mean if they’re able to sell that one for fortytwo ninetyfive . . . and if we just add a plastic part\n\nThis discussion then continued into talk based on Ivan’s experience with having a child seat on his own bike. These tacit and unplanned, drifting and discontinuous changes of activity mean that it is not always easy to track what is actually happening in teamwork. Some of the activity naturally becomes more like a conversation than a formal debate, and topics drift in and out of the conversation.\n\nGathering and sharing information\n\nThe experiment design, with its controlled access to the available information, meant that gathering information was a more overt activity than it might otherwise be. Relevant information not only had to be gathered, as in any design task, but also extracted from its source and somehow shared amongst the team. In contrast to their rather formal approach to planning and scheduling their design process, the team had a more informal approach to information gathering.\n\nThe team relied heavily on any personal experience and knowledge that members had that was relevant to the problem. For example, Kerry used her own experience to offer an opinion on off-centre loading:\n\n119",

Despite the difficulties she had in persuading the others to agree to gather information, within the first fifteen minutes of the session Kerry asked for, and received information on the target selling price, the user evaluation report and the prior prototype design. For example, she interrupted the listing of the ‘Functional Specification’ (Figure 6.3) on the board by Ivan and John to ask for information on the target selling price when this was mentioned as an item for the specification:\n\nJ: Cost target, we don’t really know what that is K: Maybe they have a – do we have that information, let’s see – do we have any specification on what the reasonable price range is?\n\nThrough her emphasis on information gathering, Kerry effectively might have been ‘volunteering’ to be the information-gatherer for the team, in the way that Ivan ‘volunteered’ to be the scheduler/timekeeper. But no formalized method for gathering and sharing information was instituted by the team, apart from the listing of requirements and concepts on the whiteboard. Perhaps because there was no formal role assigned for information gathering, some misunderstandings and errors became evident. For example, there was no suggestion in the design brief that anything other than the specific, ‘HiStar’ external- frame backpack is the backpack for which the carrying/fastening device has to be designed.

J: Says right here K: (reads from brief) Should fold down or stack away easily\n\nIt also became evident that the team members could misunderstand what were apparently shared concepts. For example, throughout the session, Ivan and John made several references to the ‘rooster tail problem’. Kerry did not query this until quite late in the session, when it became evident that she had not shared the same concept as the other two. She asked if they were referring to a particular tail-strap on the backpack, whereas they were actually referring to the spray of water/mud from the rear wheel of the bike that can come up onto the rider’s back:\n\nK: We’re calling this the rooster tail, this little tail?

There were many examples of this concept building by the team members, cooperatively adding to and refining an initial concept.\n\nIn one example, Kerry suggested adapting the carrier to be used also as a form of integral locking mechanism, and this concept was further developed by the other two team members into a device for supporting as well as locking the bike:\n\nK: Maybe if you could flip it out and it becomes a bike lock, because you know, lock up your bike while you go on a hike, that would be kind of a neat feature so you could justify some extra cost maybe.\n\nI: Right, right J: Kick-stand alternative I: Pull it around your tyre and now you can stand the bike up\n\nIn another example, the team began to brainstorm from an idea that the carrier or rack device could ‘wear’ the backpack, utilizing the existing backpack straps, and proceeded into flights of fancy (another form of analogical thinking):\n\nJ: Maybe the rack wears the backpack straps just like we wear\n\nthe backpack straps\n\nK: Sure J: (laugh) K: Why not? See, like you mount shoulders back here J: Yeah, yeah, just maybe, maybe you just mount a child seat back there and you give them a child (laugh) and make him wear the backpack\n\n123",

As well as securely holding the backpack, the proposed concept solved two particular problems: the dangling straps problem and the ‘rooster-tail’ problem, which would dirty the backpack unless it is protected. The conceptual strength of the tray idea seems to lie in the way it embodied a potential solution form that, once it had been expressed, recognizably satisfied certain key problems and also recognizably could be modified and refined to accommodate other problems and requirements in a satisfactory way. It was an example of a co-evolutionary formation of a matching problem-solution pair. Interestingly, when John introduced the concept, at one hour and twenty minutes into the session, it was the first instance of the use of the word ‘tray’ and from then on ‘tray’ was repeatedly used as the defining concept for the team’s design proposal. The word ‘tray’ subsequently occurred thirty-five times in the last forty minutes of the session, thus emphasizing the key role that it played in defining the product design (Figure 6.5).\n\nPersuasion\n\nAs well as cooperating in the building and refining of concepts, team members may find it necessary to persuade the others of the value of a concept they particularly favour (often a concept they generated themselves). It is common for designers to become committed to particular concepts, even to the extent of becoming emotionally attached to a concept. There were two clear examples within this team of the need to persuade others to accept a preferred concept. In the first, John persuaded the others that his ‘tray’ concept was the best to adopt; in the second, Ivan and Kerry persuaded John to",

It is no wonder that these conceptual ‘babies’ are defended against other, competing concepts. This emotional commitment has to be recognized and allowed for in teamwork; creative design is unlikely to happen without it. However, team members also have to be able to recognize that some suggested concepts are just jokes (‘Harry the backpack holder’), or half-serious ideas that are intended to help the creative process along and to which the originator has no serious commitment.\n\nAvoiding and resolving conflicts\n\nIt is probably inevitable that disagreement will arise between members of a design team.

More serious disagreement might have arisen if there had been competing design concepts to which different members of the team were committed. However, provided that a team collectively desires to reach an acceptable conclusion to their design task, it will have to find ways of resolving, or perhaps avoiding conflicts.\n\nIn this team, there were instances where the team members acquiesced in a kind of non-committal ‘agreement’ until one of them found an argument that closed the disagreement, and others where they postponed agreement and seemed to ‘agree to disagree’. For example, a disagreement became evident over designing for adjustability in the rack. John proposed that the support legs of the rack should be adjustable, but Kerry felt sure that this was not necessary:\n\nJ: You know one of the things that seems problematic, and it would be great from a manufacturing standpoint if you could get around it, is this distance is going to vary with frame size\n\nI: Right J: But so, y’know, we were talking about maybe those legs could extend before so that you could get some adjustability on your rack, maybe you need that anyway just so that you can adjust to different rack styles – like a telescoping tube here\n\nK: I don’t think you really need it I: (laugh) OK K: Because this is a twentysix-inch wheel, or whatever, it’s pretty standard and so if this distance – you’re right it does vary a lot, but what’s gonna change is maybe your angle on your rack is gonna change, what really is gonna happen is this is gonna be a fixed distance because if we go onto a braze-on or something down here, and you want to make sure that there’s clearance here, and then as the bike grows it might pivot up a little bit more\n\nLater, John returned again to the adjustability issue, appealing to the authority of ‘good human factors’. Both Kerry and Ivan made rather non-committal ‘agreement’ responses; Kerry just shrugged\n\n129",

Ivan resolved the issue for the time being by suggesting that they can ‘look at ways of making it adjustable’ when they are finalizing their design. But the non-committal ‘agreement’ over adjustability was not permanent. At a later point John proposed a way of incorporating adjustability into the design, but Kerry came up with an argument that resolved the disagreement in her favour: if adjustability were necessary then it would feature in the already commercially available products of the Blackburn company:\n\nJ: One way to get that adjustability for the seat post height and all that stuff is if this, say this was a single bar and it went like this K: mm mm J: And it could slide along here, that way if you need to come up more, y’know pivots around the braze-ons if it needs to come up more for a taller person or for better wheel clearance or whatever, you just kinda slide it forward and put little lock- downs on it\n\nK: Yeah yeah, I don’t think you need to change this length because the wheel is fixed enough that you can rotate about the braze- on, and I mean if you really need adjustment I think all these Blackburn racks would have adjustments\n\nThese examples of deferred agreement or non-committal apparent agreement reflect normal aspects of human discussion and verbal interchange. But design team members need to be aware of when they are close to reaching actual agreement and when they are just deferring making a committed agreement.

It is a collaborative process and, in this study, the conventional whiteboard and drawing paper tools allowed, and were used for, shared drawing and listing activities, including different team members drawing and re-drawing over shared sketches. This sharing of representations seems fundamental to collaborative design activity. We will explore more of these issues around team working and collaborative designing in the next chapter.\n\nGiven some apparent inconsistencies and difficulties in the progress of this design team, it is perhaps important to conclude with the observation that this particular group of designers was actually a very good team. They worked cooperatively and productively, and reached a successful conclusion to the set task, within the prescribed time. Despite some of the observations made about the roles, relationships and social interactions within the team, there were no overt signs of frustration or dissatisfaction within individual members of the team.

This was made possible through the use of laboratory ‘protocol study’ experiments that were in many senses far removed from the reality of everyday design practice. In this chapter, I will develop a broader summary and comparison of these two experimental studies, and try to draw evidence and conclusions about the way designers work when confronted with a design task. The fact that these two experimental studies have been the subjects of detailed analysis by several researchers (in an international conference on Analysing Design Activity) will help to make the comparisons and summaries, but first we must acknowledge the problems and limitations of such studies.\n\nIt was clear in some of Victor Scheinman’s ‘think aloud’ statements that he felt constrained in the experimental situation; for example, he referred to what he would do in a normal situation, such as call an expert friend, but which wasn’t possible to do in the experimental situation. (He did manage to go ‘outside’ of the experimental situation and do something that surprised the experimenters, when he telephoned for advice from a company making similar products.) However, there were other, more subtle clues within the recordings of the experiment that indicated that we cannot rely totally on ‘think-aloud’ statements as records of mental processes. Some researchers have pointed out that non-verbal thought seems to be intrinsic to design thinking and that the forced verbalization of protocol studies must interfere with non-verbal thought processes.",

      "content": "134\n\nDESIGN THINKING\n\nIt was also clear that there were many points in Victor’s stream of comments where his verbalizations stopped for several seconds. On one occasion, he had to be prompted by the experimenter to resume his thinking aloud. Commenting on Victor’s silent moments, Peter Lloyd and his colleagues suggested that ‘it seems obvious that in these short periods of silence he is thinking deeply about something’, and that these silent periods ‘seem to be points of value where decisions are made, but we have no idea of the thinking behind these decisions’.\n\nSo we have to be careful about drawing very strong conclusions about deep cognitive processes from such experiments, in which a designer works alone and tries to verbalize their thinking. The second experiment, in which the three-person team of designers worked more naturally, although still within tight experimental constraints, obviously also contains many gaps in the individual thought processes, when a team member is silent, where again we can make little assumption about what the individual was thinking. However, there are lots of useful observations that can be made from such experiments as these, and in fact both these experiments have been analysed quite considerably and in depth by a number of independent researchers.\n\nCreative working\n\nWe have seen previously, in Chapter 1 and the earlier case studies, that experienced, successful designers have ways of working that enable them to reach creative insights and make promising conjectures that drive the design process forward. Whilst maintaining a deep involvement with details within a particular project, they also have a way of keeping up an apparently higher level of awareness for spotting constructive opportunities that may emerge during the process. In Victor Scheinman’s design work there were several points at which he clearly recognized breakthroughs or significant concept generation points, using expressions such as ‘Ah-ha!’ and ‘Good idea!’ These expressions indicate that he feels he is ‘on to something’, that a way forward is opening up.",

      "content": "HOW DESIGNERS WORK\n\nÖmer Akin and Chengtah Lin analysed Victor’s work and identified a number of what they called ‘novel design decisions’: that is, non-routine decisions that ‘turn out to be critical for the progress of the entire design’. Whilst there was a large number of ‘routine’ design decisions in Victor’s protocol, Akin and Lin identified just ten novel design decisions (NDDs), which were characterized by three features: an NDD resolves a problem or bottleneck, it does not follow from previous assumptions and the designer identifies the NDD as an important feature of the overall design. A particular example is the emergence of Victor’s decision to base his design on a triangular frame, when he said: ‘It would be nice if I could, for instance, run these rods up here to some point and therefore create a triangle, this would give me great stiffness – good idea!’\n\nAkin and Lin sorted Victor’s working activities into three categories: examining (such as reading information, inspecting the available bike or backpack), thinking (whether verbalized or silent) and drawing. They then went on to record the frequency with which Victor switched between these activities and found an interesting correlation between the frequency of switching and the occurrence of NDDs. In almost all cases, they found Victor was alternating between the three activity modes in rapid succession at the point of reaching a novel design decision. Akin and Lin were rightly cautious about drawing any inference that rapid succession between different activities actually causes or produces NDDs. Their observation was only that the two seem to go together. They concluded only that ‘Our data suggest that designers explore their domain of ideas in a variety of activity modes when they go beyond routine decisions and achieve design breakthroughs’, and that ‘The designer appears to be decidedly engaged in all three major activities at the time of the NDD’. What their analysis suggests is that a designer’s level of engagement rises, and they work across a wider span of attention to different facets of the problem and solution, as they sense the achievement of a critical, creative point in the process.\n\nSome other studies have also noted the apparent importance of frequent shifts of attention or between activity modes in influencing either the creativity or overall quality of the design concepts produced. For example, in protocol studies of industrial design students, Henri Christiaans segmented the students’ activities into the three modes\n\n135",

He suggested that the students who were more successful in producing creative design concepts were those who showed evidence of rapid alternation between the activity modes. Also, Cindy Atman and her colleagues, from studies of engineering design students, found that the overall quality of the design concepts that the students generated was related to evidence of more fluid and rapid transitions occurring between different activities in the design process, such as gathering information, generating ideas and modelling. We will look at these findings in more depth in Chapter 8.\n\nOf course, there can be no suggestion of causality; simply flitting more quickly between activity types is not necessarily going to help a designer to be more creative. It seems rather that creative working is associated with a high level of concentration and engagement, especially at points when a designer senses a critical moment in the progress of the project.\n\nTeam working\n\nDesign work is rarely a matter of a single individual working alone, as in the protocol study of Victor Scheinman. A lot of designing involves collaboration with other people, such as specialist consultants, clients or potential customers for a new product, and most design work takes place in a collaborative studio environment with and alongside colleagues. In a study of graphic designers, for example, Dianne Murray recorded the very social nature of design in practice and emphasized the openness and richness of activities within a design studio: ‘Briefing sessions take place in the studio in clear sight and sound of everyone. Work in progress is left on drawing boards; discarded sketches, photocopies, printouts and transparencies are left lying around on desks or on the light box.’ She commented that ‘Design is not hidden, it is constructed in public so other people can read it, and accepting commentary on it from somebody else is part of a tradition they embody’.\n\nSo a valuable aspect of the teamwork study here is that it enables us to observe how designers work together with one another. We have seen in that experiment how the three designers successfully worked",

Some researchers who analysed this experiment noted the different styles and approaches that were shown by the three, and especially the differences between Kerry’s and John’s approaches. Particularly in the early part of the session, Kerry tended to want to gather specific information and to engage with the available hardware and some of its details, whereas John tended to want to step back from details, work at a more general level of the overall process and gain a broad view of the problem.\n\nThe different approaches of Kerry and John were summarized by Margot Brereton and her colleagues as wanting to pin down a solution (Kerry) and wanting to preserve ambiguity (John) (Table 7.1). Having two such complementary emphases within a team can be good, but of course it has to be managed to avoid conflict and achieve a constructive outcome. Brereton pointed out that, to resolve or avoid conflict, ‘The designers masterfully invoke the support of neutral parties such as common sense, higher principles or theories, and expert or standard practices to support their opinions. These serve to depersonalise the debate, in addition to being means of persuasion and explanation of rationale.’ These experienced designers seem to have had some effective strategies for working together that built on each other’s preferences for ways of approaching the design task. Brereton concluded that ‘the collaboration is successful because the group is well balanced in their roles and manages their negotiation well. Kerry seeks to pin down solution alternatives, John seeks to preserve ambiguity and characterize the ongoing process, and Ivan keeps the solution progress on track and acts as an arbitrator between John and Kerry’ (Table 7.2).\n\nTABLE 7.1 Different design approaches of Kerry and John\n\nKerry: Pin down solution\n\nJohn: Preserve ambiguity\n\nDesign specifically for the given backpack and bicycle Focus on rear placement (most promising candidate) Design for a fixed position Use emerging industry standard attachment method\n\nDesign for various backpacks and bicycles Consider all possible placements\n\nMake device adjustable Use attachment method usable by all bikes\n\n137",

Whilst John produced more solution variant ideas, equal to those of the other two together, all three contributed equally in analysis comments on solution variants, and John and Kerry each contributed exactly the same number of decisions in choosing between solution variants (Ivan rather less). Ivan, as we might now expect, made many more comments on organizing the process, in contrast to Kerry who made very few such comments.\n\nAn individual designer working alone has no one to collaborate with, so how does the work of an individual designer compare with that of a team? These two experiments, using the same design task, allow us to make such a comparison, and the question was explicitly addressed in an analysis by Gabriela Goldschmidt. She pointed out that the cognitive tasks within design can be shared out between team members, whereas a designer working on their own has to produce the full range of tasks of inquiring, formulating, suggesting, evaluating, modifying and so on. She compared several key sequences of activity between Victor and the team, and found some significant similarities, with Victor’s activities often ‘shadowing’ those of the team. She observed that\n\nHe oscillates between overviews and technical details, between functional aspects of the design product and issues related to human factors.

The single designer has only him or herself to rely on, and he or she must act as a team and give all the answers while also asking all the questions.\n\nThese comments indicate some of the complexity that there is in the task of designing. Goldschmidt’s conclusion is that Victor implicitly ‘plays’ several roles and acts as ‘a team of one’, as in this extract from his think-aloud comments about adding some plastic clips to his rack design that would grip and hold the backpack frame: ‘Why do we want clips? Because we want to take advantage of the fact we’re using an external-frame backpack. An internal frame can’t use clips.’ Here, she suggests, Victor1 asks, Victor2 answers and Victor3 gives the design rationale. In this, there is an echo of designers ‘talking to themselves’ implicitly through their drawings and in their scribbled comments. In both Victor’s and the team processes there are also echoes and perhaps a confirmation of Donald Schön’s characterization of design as ‘a reflective conversation with the situation’.\n\nTeam leadership\n\nSome of the researchers who analysed the team’s work regarded John as acting in a ‘team leader’ role, partly because he seemed to be the ‘ideas person’ but also because he would make comments intended to focus and direct the conversation. Ivan also showed leadership in organizing the process by acting as whiteboard manager and timekeeper. We do not know what relationships or roles the team members may have brought with them from their normal work environment (they were all members of the same large design office), so there might have been some built-in hierarchies within the team. In some situations the leader might be pre-assigned to that role, or it might emerge informally through the course of a teamwork project. However, most real-world design teams do have some form of hierarchy, particularly where one member is clearly identified as being the team leader. That person is usually charged\n\n139",

Andy Dong made a very detailed analysis of the conversational patterns of this team and others in similar experiments, and suggested that the constructive influence of a member in a design team is due to the way they interact with the others and articulate shared concepts. He observed that, ‘while John is a productive individual idea generator, he also builds upon Ivan’s and Kerry’s ideas’. For example, Dong refers to points in the conversation where John ‘accumulates the discourse’ and characterizes a shared concept at that point, such as ‘maybe it’s a pack conversion kit’ or ‘maybe it’s a little vacuum-formed tray’. To ‘accumulate the discourse’ means not just to sum up but to make a constructive contribution that focuses the previous discussion onto a type of solution concept and suggests a way forward. Dong referred to this as ‘deriving a representation of the team’s shared language that frames the design concept’.\n\nHowever, in successful team design work, this constructive approach is not due to just one member of the team. Dong also looked at other teams and found that, in the more successful teams, the whole pattern of their conversation was more focused. A successful team’s discussion showed more ‘coherent’ development, in which the team members built upon each other’s contributions, progressing in a coherent form of conversation. The evidence for this lay in measuring how closely team members’ contributions to the discussion followed on from previous contributions, rather than diverging from them.\n\nThe importance and the nature of the role played by a team leader were identified by Chih-Chun Chen and colleagues in a study of a team of experienced designers in a real-world, cross-cultural (Europe/ China) automotive accessories design project. Their conclusion was that ‘the role of a leader in collaborative design can be vital to team success’. This success is based on how the team leader controls team progress by coordinating team discussions, helping the team to build up shared understandings of the problem situation and to collaborate in accumulating and progressing solution ideas. They suggested that team leadership shapes collaborative designing",

A key aspect of effective communication is the role of the leader as a ‘communication hub’, receiving ideas and opinions from team members and relaying them back to the speaker and the rest of the team for clarification, exploration and confirmation. For this to be effective, team members need to feel comfortable in sharing their comments and proposals; when a team is working well members do not respond negatively to each other’s comments and proposals but by proposing re-interpretations or constructive alternatives.\n\nFrom their study of teamwork in medical product design, mentioned in Chapter 4 with respect to co-evolution, Stefan Wiltschnig and his colleagues also emphasized the role of the team leader in initiating constructive, co-evolutionary creative design episodes. This was particularly so with regard to making changes in the initial problem requirements that subsequently led to solution proposals. These initiatives were often purposefully introduced by the team leader. Witschnig reported that ‘many design conversations were initiated by the team leader mentioning or amending a design requirement. Other members of the design team would then contribute useful ideas, either by way of developing the interpretation of the requirement or by way of generating and evaluating solution possibilities.’\n\nAn example of this was an episode initiated by team leader K and progressed by team member M. They are discussing product features for the ease and safety of use in a type of ostomy bag, which is worn by the user to hold fluid draining from their body:\n\nK: What else have we got . . . we’ve talked about whether we could do something to avoid making it impossible to fold it this way.

If you could make something so it was not so high up\n\nK: So you couldn’t fold it\n\nHere, team leader K initiates a discussion on how the user might mishandle the bag and how the fastening of the bag might be designed to prevent that. Team member M confirms the problem and suggests\n\n141",

Over the next few minutes the team pursued a string of related solution suggestions involving changing the bag closure in several ways to overcome the folding issue, such as incorporating colour coding or adding text, or changing the user instruction manual.\n\nThe researchers commented that ‘These episodes did not seem to involve great leaps in creative discovery regarding how the formulation of the problem should change, but rather entailed minor increments being introduced by the team leader in order to change the focus to another part of the design problem space.’ However, they added that the team leader’s role ‘seems to be vital for the achievement of organisational goals relating to the delivery of high-quality, innovative design solutions’. In initiating and coordinating changes of focus the team leader is performing acts of metacognition – which means thinking about one’s own thinking or reflecting on the team’s process and progress and making changes as necessary. Individual designers working alone also perform these acts of metacognition in working as a ‘team of one’.\n\nDesign process\n\nExperienced designers know that it is possible to go on almost forever gathering information and data about a design problem, but that they have to move on to generating solution proposals, which in themselves begin to indicate what is relevant information. In a design project it is often not at all clear what ‘the problem’ is; it may have been only loosely defined by the client, many constraints and criteria may be undefined and everyone involved in the project may know that goals may be redefined during the project. In designing, ‘problems’ are often defined in relation to ideas for their ‘solution’, and designers do not typically proceed by first attempting to define their problems rigorously, which they know may be impossible. Of course, this can mean that important information is overlooked or might be discovered only very late in the design process, causing disruption and delay. For these reasons, there have been attempts to set out formal, metacognitive models of an ideal design process and",

Their model process consisted of the following stages:\n\nQuantify the problem Generate concepts Refine concepts Select a concept Design Present\n\nSome analysts have looked at the actual process that the team (and Victor) followed. For example, Joachim Günther and colleagues analysed the individual statements in the team’s conversations into three types, concerned with (1) clarifying the task, (2) searching for concepts and (3) fixing the concept. Charts of their analyses of the team’s and Victor’s processes are given in Figure 7.1. We can\n\nFIGURE 7.1 Principal phases of the team’s (top) and Victor Scheinman’s (bottom) design processes.

For the team, throughout the first half of the session there was a lot of iteration between ‘clarifying the task’ and ‘searching for concepts’. What the team was actually doing through this period was generating lots of partial concepts and then considering the implications of those concepts. In that way they were exploring the problem through possible solutions. They did not spend very long on their initial task of ‘quantify the problem’ in isolation from generation of concepts, but after about twenty minutes they began to consider specific aspects of solution concepts and then (thanks to Ivan) organized this into searches for ‘joining concepts’, divided into joining ‘pack to rack’ and ‘rack to bike’. The chart in Figure 7.1 (top) shows clearly that ‘searching for concepts’ dominated most of the team’s process, but came to a fairly quick stop soon after they identified the ‘tray’ concept, at around eighty minutes. Overall, they followed the activities that they had set out in their model process but not in a strict sequence of separate activities.\n\nIt might seem surprising that ‘clarifying the task’ is an activity that recurs throughout so much of the session, as it did in the team’s process. But it is quite normal in the design process that there is an ongoing interactive, co-evolutionary exploration and development of both the problem and the solution. A pattern similar to this team’s activity pattern has been found in other studies and is not a-typical. For example, Vinod Goel found, in protocol studies of architectural design, that ‘problem structuring’ could constitute as much as 30 per cent of the overall task time, and although it was concentrated near the beginning of the task it could recur constantly until almost the very end of the session.\n\nThe chart of Victor’s process in Figure 7.1 (bottom) shows more clear-cut separation of activities, especially in the first half-hour, in which he concentrated on ‘clarifying the task’ by reading the brief and the evaluation report on the previous prototype solution, and telephoning a company that makes similar products. Victor spent some time in familiarizing himself with the task, including considering his own personal experiences of riding with a backpack as well as collecting information from others. A concern with user issues was more evident in Victor’s process than it was in that of the team. He ‘internalized’ the problem information, rather than making",

In fact, much of his design activity was similar to that of the team, in that he made progress by proposing a partial solution concept and then analysing its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nVictor commented at one point that ‘scheduling my time on these things, that’s the hard part’, and he frequently commented on the time constraint he was working under. Organizing a design process is quite a difficult task, because there has to be allowance for free- flowing activity within an overall schedule of things to be done within a time limit. The team’s design process seemed quite complex; it was free-flowing, but it was also quite controlled. Brereton et al. concluded that ‘the designers are continuously engaged in multiple activities at different levels. Although they focus in on issues, they continuously monitor the progress of the solution from the point of view of various requirements and solution alternatives. They reflect on their course of action, monitoring and modifying their process.’\n\nThe differences, such as they are, between the design processes of Victor and the team seem to be more to do with the differences between individual and team working processes. Victor was ‘a team of one’ and he was not subject to the pressures and constraints of working with other people, such as we considered in the analysis of teamwork in the previous chapter.\n\nStructure versus spontaneity\n\nSome other studies have identified that designers usually start with a structured plan for their design process, as our team did, but frequently slip from the plan into opportunistic pursuit of issues or partial solutions that catch the designer’s attention, again as our team did. It has been argued that opportunistic behaviour, often derogatorily regarded elsewhere, is appropriate behaviour for designers because it allows the flexibility to deal with design\n\n145",

For example, Willemien Visser made a study of an experienced mechanical engineering designer who claimed to be following a structured approach, but Visser found frequent deviations from this plan. She noted that ‘The engineer had a hierarchically structured plan for his activity, but he used it in an opportunistic way. He used it only as long as it was profitable from the point of view of cognitive cost. If more economical cognitive actions arose, he abandoned it.’ Thus Visser regarded reducing ‘cognitive cost’ – that is the mental load of maintaining a principled, structured approach – as a major reason for abandoning planned actions and instead, for example, delving into pursuing a partial solution at a relatively early stage of the process.\n\nRaymonde Guindon also emphasized the opportunistic nature of design activities, which was evident in her protocol studies of three experienced software system designers. Guindon stressed that ‘designers frequently deviate from a top-down approach. These results cannot be accounted for by a model of the design process where problem specification and understanding precedes solution development and where the design solution is elaborated at successively greater levels of detail in a top-down manner.’ Guindon observed the interleaving of problem specification with solution development, ‘drifting’ through partial solution development, and jumps into exploring suddenly recognized partial solutions, which were categorized as major causes of ‘opportunistic solution development’. However, rather than regarding this opportunism as a weak feature of design behaviour, Guindon suggested it might be inevitable, because ‘These deviations are not special cases due to bad design habits or performance breakdowns but are, rather, a natural consequence of the ill-structuredness of problems in the early stages of design’. Like Visser, Guindon also referred to ‘cognitive cost’ as one possible explanation for such behaviour: ‘Designers find it advantageous to follow a train of thought temporarily, thus arriving at partial solutions at little cognitive cost.’\n\nClearly, whether it’s a single designer or a design team they have to monitor and adjust their own design process as they move through a project; they must occasionally take a step back from the activities they are directly engaged in to reflect on their progress.

They identified the operation of this metacognitive skill occurring where someone in the team uses phrases such as ‘we need to’, ‘we should’, ‘I think we’ or words related to process awareness such as ‘insight’, ‘focus’, ‘fixated’ or ‘incubation’. In the short account earlier of the problem of users potentially mishandling an ostomy bag, the team leader initiated a change of focus with the phrase ‘so what have we got?’, suggesting a summarizing and progress review point in the process.\n\nCollaborative designing\n\nIt seems especially hard in teamwork to follow a tightly prescribed process because individual members may have individual preferences for ways of working. There is often a natural flow to design processes that can run counter to a prescription for what should happen when. The team process in collaborative designing therefore requires particular attention to how natural conversation can be guided into a constructive, productive and creative process. One means of helping to do this is to externalize aspects of the conversation into a shared public space.\n\nWe saw in our team design experiment how they used a whiteboard for listing process steps, problem structures and solution ideas. The whiteboard is a means of externalizing and recording thoughts, and also supports moments of reflection when the team pauses and considers what they have on the whiteboard. Through this kind of externalizing, a design team is able to share and deal with complex structures and relationships that are very difficult or impossible to hold solely within the brain. The use of sticky notes, either on a whiteboard or some other flat surface, has now become almost ubiquitous in team processes of all kinds for this kind of externalization. In design teamwork, they have joined other common supportive media for designing such as sketching, modelling and prototyping.\n\nThe use of sticky notes in collaborative design has been studied to identify how they support particular aspects of design thinking.\n\n147",

In a short amount of time a blank workspace can thus become populated with a multitude of visually distinct ideas’. They argued that ‘to disregard the humble sticky note as a key support material in creative design is to ignore a whole sphere of cognition that underpins effective real-world design practice’.\n\nBall suggested that the properties of sticky notes make them not just an easy means of recording and structuring ideas, but that they are inherently supportive of design thinking in collaborative processes. The visual and adjustable display of sticky notes supports perceptions and other cognitive design processes in identifying and modifying conceptual relations amongst the parts to form wholes. Ball proposed that the use of sticky notes makes it possible for a design team ‘(i) to consider the parts as “variables” in a system, thereby enabling the exchange of parts, while retaining the structural whole; (ii) to restructure the whole representation into new representations by re-configuring the parts; and (iii) to explore and establish dynamically new possible structural links to existing concepts, thereby gradually and generatively “building-up” or advancing a conceptual whole with new emergent properties’. That outline might be regarded as offering a neat summary not only of collaborative designing processes but also of design thinking more generally. Like drawing and sketching in design (as I commented in Chapter 4), sticky notes permit and encourage simultaneous, non-hierarchical participation in collaborative designing, using a common representation.\n\nFrequently, collaborative designing includes designers working with a wide range of participants or stakeholders, including end-users of the proposed design result. This involves different attitudes towards and patterns of design activity that have to be accommodated within the design process. In user-centred workshops in communication design for sustainable cleaning in childcare centres and for asthma management and awareness, Simone Taffe found that non-designer participants were happy to engage in idea generation but reluctant to evaluate the collected ideas. For example, ‘the childcare staff were reluctant to place evaluation dots on the cleaning moodboard",

She also found that a ranking method often used by communication designers was resisted by the asthma staff because\n\nthe words to be sorted presented a mix of negative and positive issues. Seeing printed cards displaying the negative aspects of [their own] work practices created an immediate barrier for the asthma staff, preventing them from participating in the card ranking activity. The designer technique of ranking was perceived as confrontational whereas discussion was more conducive to forming a consensus towards good ideas.\n\nCollaborative designing is therefore clearly a social process and so progress can be influenced by normal issues of social interaction, such as reluctance to criticize others in a group. Externalizing aspects of the process, through the use of whiteboards, idea cards, sticky notes and other modelling, is a way of opening up the design process and making social interaction cooperative and creative. However, collaborative designing has to be carefully managed to create a successful process of social and creative interaction that enhances group knowledge and skill.\n\nCreative designing\n\nIn making an analysis of our backpack-carrier team design experiment, David Radcliffe spotted a weakness in the team’s process that constrained their creativity. They decomposed the overall problem into sub-problems of joining ‘pack to rack’ and ‘rack to bike’, as shown in Ivan’s whiteboard lists of the various concepts (Figure 6.4). At the core of their problem structuring was the concept of a ‘rack’. But the design brief that the team was given asked for ‘a carrying/fastening device’ – something much more open than directly specifying ‘a rack’. This particular interpretation severely limited much of the team’s exploration of the problem.\n\nRadcliffe noticed that this decomposition of the problem made it difficult for the team to consider solution concepts that arose naturally\n\n149",

At separate times both Kerry and John commented on the fact that the existing external frame of the backpack was in itself a structure something like a rack. Kerry commented that ‘We’ve already got that frame on the pack; it would be nice if we can take advantage of that’. A little later, John commented that ‘there’s a kind of other class of solutions outside of our design problem [structure], and that’s that you could somehow use the external frame and wouldn’t need the rack’. Just a little later again, Kerry formulated a solution concept for a simple device, suggesting that ‘maybe the attachment is kind of a leg that attaches right to the external frame’. Radcliffe notes that, ‘Ivan records the concept on the whiteboard as “legs on frame” under the “pack to rack” heading . . . There is no explicit acknowledgement that this concept falls outside the pack-to-rack/rack-to-bike dichotomy. In terms of the recorded work of the team, listing concepts under suitably decomposed headings takes precedence over capturing less structured or controllable emergence of design ideas.’\n\nA ‘no-rack’ concept clearly does not fit anywhere within the team’s problem decomposition. Although the team went on to consider some more ideas for such a ‘no-rack’ concept, eventually it was lost as they returned to their more orderly sequence of planned activities. This loss of a potentially radical, creative solution was precisely due to the team creating, and sticking to, a specific structuring of the problem. In collaborative and co-designing, which often has a broad brief and can include heterogeneous teams comprising not only designers but also clients, customers and other specialists, leaving the problem structure as open as possible for as long as possible can help to avoid premature fixation and the unnecessary restriction of solution types.\n\nDavid Radcliffe also concluded from his analysis that the team’s progress to a solution concept demonstrated that the emergence of creative ideas cannot be constrained to a particular place or sequence within a design process. He pointed out, ‘It is clear that design ideas emerge where they will in the continuum of the design conversation . . . Ideation cannot be constrained to occur only during the prescribed time for this activity as dictated by notions of due process and proper sequence of phases in design.’ To provide a specific emphasis, Radcliffe pointed out that the team’s decisive ‘tray’ concept was",

Did the tray idea just come ‘out of the blue’ or was it an ‘accumulation’ of previous ideas and contributions? It was certainly the first instance of the use of the word ‘tray’, but some possibly related concepts that had been mentioned earlier included references to plastic as a possible material and flat, solid forms for the rack device. In fact, nearly twenty minutes earlier than he first expressed the tray idea, John had referred to a similar kind of rack idea that he recalled: ‘Actually a friend of mine suggested, a couple of years ago, a product that he would do, an injection-moulded rack that would kind of like fold down.’ And Ivan immediately responded with recalling a similar bicycle luggage device that he remembered: ‘It’s like a little rack that was flat, it had these panels . . . but these panels were solid, it had little wheels . . . and it would come off and then it would be like a little trailer.’ Ivan went on to explain how it worked when folded up on the back of a bicycle by over-drawing it on a sketch that Kerry had made (silently) much earlier of something very like a ‘tray’ on the back of a bike (Figure 7.2).\n\nSo ideas related to the device as a tray-like, flat sheet, probably of plastic, had been suggested earlier, both explicitly by John and Ivan and implicitly by Kerry in her sketch. The significant difference seems to be the overt expression by John of this concept as a ‘tray’ – that is a flat surface with a raised lip around its circumference. The strength of the ‘tray’ concept seems to be that it identified and summarized an easily recognizable, appropriate solution form, in a way that was significantly different from the earlier concepts of a ‘flat’, ‘folded’, ‘panel’. We can see that it drew upon those earlier concepts that, in retrospect, seem very similar, but that lacked the apparently critical feature of ‘containment’ that a tray has. Its generation was perhaps aided by the immediately prior consideration of a more extreme form\n\n151",

Like the bag, the tray concept seemed to focus on one particular problem (containing the backpack’s straps) as the most significant consideration, but it was quickly elaborated to satisfy a range of other problems and functions. John’s expression of the concept was also timely – it came at the point when the team was trying to ‘select a concept’ and move on from problem exploration and concept generation to final design work.\n\nIt might seem that John’s apparently sudden expression of the ‘tray’ concept is an example of a ‘creative leap’. However, our analysis has shown that the expression of the concept actually ‘accumulates’ a lot of prior concepts, examples and discussions within the team. It is more like the key frame of ‘keep newspapers separate’ that occurred for the litter bin designers in Chapter 4. Creative designing is not necessarily the making of a sudden ‘leap’ from the problem space into the solution space, from requirements to solution, but is the formulation of an apposite proposal. Once the proposal is made, it is seen to be an apposite response to the given, explored and framed problem situation. It is an abductively reasoned conclusion that creates a resolution of the design requirements on the one hand and the design structure of a potential new product on the other, a matching problem-solution pair.

The leadership influence of a member in a team arises from how they interact with the others, articulating shared understanding of the problem and accumulating and progressing solution idea concepts. A successful team’s discussion shows coherent development, with the team members building upon each other’s contributions. Process awareness is a cognitive creativity skill that facilitates progress. In initiating and coordinating the process, a team leader is performing acts of metacognition. A design team may set up a planned procedure, but they recognize that this is a framework that will be adapted as the work progresses. Externalizing aspects of the process, through the use of sticky notes, drawings and other modelling, are ways of opening up the design process and making social interaction cooperative and creative. When a key concept is voiced other members of the team recognize it as important and apposite, combining a resolution of the design requirements on the one hand and the structure of a potential design solution on the other: a proposal of a matching problem-solution pair. The apparent sudden illumination is more like constructing a creative bridge between the problem space and the solution space than like taking a creative leap from one to the other.\n\nSources\n\nFull citations are given in the References.\n\nÖmer Akin and Chengtah Lin: Design protocol data and novel design\n\ndecisions, Design Studies.\n\n153",

In the main, my approach has been one of empirical investigation, based on reported experience or observation and analysis. In explaining and relating these various studies, I have tried to build an evidence-based understanding of how designers think and work, and the nature of expert performance in design. In this final chapter I will consider design expertise more generally, its development from novice to expert, and suggest that the developed cognitive skills of design thinking can be regarded as a particular form of intelligence.\n\nExperts and novices\n\nMany of the classic studies of expertise have been based on examples of game-playing (such as chess) or on comparisons of experts versus novices in solving routine problems (e.g. in puzzle solving). These studies are generally examples of solving what are called well-defined problems, whereas designers characteristically deal with ill-defined problems, where there is no definitive, complete formulation of the problem and no single or verifiably correct solution.

For example, creative experts might reformulate the given task so that it is more problematic – that is deliberately treat it as ill-defined – which is contrary to the assumption that experts will generally solve a problem in the ‘easiest’ way or certainly with more ease than novices. In some ways, therefore, experts in creative fields treat problems as ‘harder’ problems than do novices. We saw examples of that in the discussion of design ability in Chapter 1 and in the case studies of Gordon Murray and Kenneth Grange: examples of designers going beyond the brief or ‘given’ problem.\n\nExperts will often see a given problem as more complex than do novices, partly because of their greater experience. In studies of problem-solving, novice behaviour is usually associated with a ‘depth-first’ approach, which means that the novice identifies a problem aspect and immediately begins exploring its solution in depth. In designing, this results in partial sub-solutions that may be difficult to reconcile together into a satisfactory overall solution. The strategies of experts, however, are usually regarded as exhibiting predominantly breadth-first approaches, that is starting with a broad problem exploration and developing partial sub-solutions together in parallel. In designing, this is reflected in expert designers’ considering broader contextual aspects of the design problem before moving on to aspects of more detail.\n\nSome depth-first and breadth-first aspects were observed between the behaviour of novice and experienced designers in studies by Saeema Ahmed and her colleagues. They found clear differences between the behaviours of new graduate entrants to the engineering profession and much more experienced design engineers. The novices used ‘trial and error’ techniques of generating and implementing a design modification, evaluating it, then generating another and so on through many iterations. Experienced engineers were observed to make a preliminary evaluation of their tentative decisions before implementing them and making a final evaluation. They used the foresight they had gained from experience to consider whether it seemed worthwhile to move further into the implementation stage of a design decision.\n\nHowever, a more complex view has gradually emerged as more studies are made of expert designer behaviour. We have already seen how designers can exhibit opportunistic behaviour in pursuing",

This was contextualized further by Linden Ball and his colleagues, who studied the strategies of both hardware and software designers and suggested that ‘experts will often tend to mix both breadth-first and depth-first solution development strategies . . . the preferred strategy of expert designers is a top-down, breadth-first one, but experts will switch to depth-first design to deal strategically with situations where their knowledge is stretched. Thus, depth- first design is a response to factors such as problem complexity and design uncertainty.’ This suggests that, as well as spotting promising opportunities for solution generation, even expert designers will run up against unfamiliar problems and will have to make some initial in-depth exploration of partial solution concepts in order to assess their viability.\n\nFrom novice to expert\n\nWe are all familiar with the concepts of the novice learner and the expert performer, and aware that something happens in the development from one to the other. A novice undergoes training and education in their chosen field and then at some later point becomes an expert.\n\nThe development of expertise usually seems to pass through different phases (Figure 8.1). In all fields, the accumulation of experience is a vital part of the transformation from novice to expert. For some people, the expert level of achievement is where they remain, perhaps with some continued moderate improvement before reaching their peak and beginning their decline. A few manage to go beyond the level of their peers into a further stage of development, reaching outstanding levels of achievement and mastery. At the other end of the scale of maturity, at a young age, all of us are introduced to a variety of human activities, whether it be making music, playing football, drawing pictures or writing stories. We all improve a little, but some, as noted earlier, will begin to practice with a dedication – and probably a joy or even obsession – that sets them apart.\n\n157",

It is not simply a matter of knowing more and learning to work more quickly or smoothly. The changes in level involve learning to work in different ways. This shift to working in a different way can develop almost unnoticed by the learner but can mean shifts in level of attention that we all experience in learning a skill, as the fundamental practices become performed less consciously and flow more easily.\n\nThere has been much more of a history of studies on understanding expertise and expert performance in fields and contexts other than design, including chess, music, science and sports. From these studies, there is a general view that expertise can only be developed over time as a person matures. Usually, there comes a point when a peak of performance is reached and then a seemingly inevitable decline begins. This performance peak will be reached at different ages in different domains: for physical sports, it may be around the age of middle-twenties, whereas in cognitive activities it may not be until much later in life; in the sciences, people seem to produce their best work in their thirties, whilst in the arts it may be in their forties. Some outstanding individuals seem to defy the general pattern of development-peak-decline and continue producing great work well into later years.\n\nA general aspect that seems agreed from studies of expertise is that it requires a minimum period of practice and sustained",

This is a matter not simply of experience or exposure to the field of endeavour but of dedicated application. One of the key factors in the acquisition of expertise is believed to be deliberate, sustained, guided practice.\n\nThe psychologist Anders Ericsson, who is an expert in the study of expertise, has suggested that ‘The attained level of performance of many types of experts, such as musicians, chess players and athletes, is closely related to their accumulated amount of deliberate practice’. Usually, a young person may display a certain aptitude or interest, and parents or teachers then encourage and guide their development. But without the dedicated application of the individual, levels of performance will remain modest. Again, according to Ericsson,\n\nSuperior expert performance is primarily acquired . . . Many thousands of hours of deliberate practice and training are necessary to reach the highest levels of performance . . . Most international masters emphasise the role of motivation, concentration, and the willingness to work hard on improving performance . . . The masters seem to consider inborn capacities and innate talent as relatively unimportant.\n\nSo in all fields it seems that the key to the development of expertise is practice, practice, practice.\n\nDevelopment of expertise\n\nAs we have seen, many studies of expert designers suggest that from initial scoping of the given problem they move on to early solution conjectures and use these conjectures as a way of exploring and defining the problem and solution together. This solution-focused nature of designing was first noted by Bryan Lawson in comparisons he made of the problem-solving behaviours of scientists and architects. Lawson set the same problem-solving exercise for students of science and architecture and found that senior students could be distinguished as adopting predominantly either problem-focused or solution-focused strategies. The science students attempted to\n\n159",

These differences were noticeable amongst senior students but not amongst first-years, so it appeared that the architects had learned their solution-focused strategy during their education as an effective strategy for resolving the kinds of problems that they had been set. They had learned to think like designers.\n\nEducation in design has long-established practices that are assumed to help the progression from novice to expert, although in general they are not based on evaluated evidence. There is still rather limited understanding of the differences between novice and expert performance in design, and how to help students move from one to the other, but there has been some progress.\n\nFor example, Henri Christiaans found, from protocol studies of industrial design students, that junior students did not seek a lot of information on the project they were given, and tended to ‘solve a simple problem’, being unaware of a lot of potential criteria, difficulties and possibilities. These are characteristics of a novice. Amongst senior students he found that they could be divided into two types. Although they all gathered more project information than junior students, for one type the activity of gathering information was too dominant, and sometimes just a substitute activity for actually moving on to design work. The more successful type, in terms of the quality of their solutions, gathered rather less information but considered it more carefully and gave the impression of consciously building up a broader view of the problem.\n\nVery similar conclusions were reached by Cynthia Atman and her colleagues, who found from protocol studies of engineering students that, amongst first-year students ‘those who spent a large proportion of their time defining the problem did not produce quality designs’. As with the industrial design students, it seemed that the novice engineering students just solved simple interpretations of the problem or became stuck in problem definition and did not progress satisfactorily into further stages of the design process. However, amongst senior students Atman did find that attention to initial ‘problem scoping’ (i.e. ‘adequately setting up the problem before analysis begins’, including gathering a larger amount and wider",

In general, developing greater expertise means developing a broader and more complex understanding of what has to be achieved, and this seems to be the case in design: more experience leads to more sophisticated problem scoping and defining.\n\nDeveloping design thinking\n\nCynthia Atman has led a significant programme of studies into the nature of design expertise and its development through education. She and her colleagues focused on recording and assessing the design processes of engineering students, through a series of laboratory-type protocol studies of design projects in different years of study. They also made complementary studies of the processes of experienced professional designers working on the same projects as were set for the students. They recorded the sequences of different activities that were employed by the designer throughout a design process, from problem definition to idea generation, through modelling and evaluating proposals, to communication of a final design. For each designer, the pattern of activities was portrayed in standardized timeline plots of their individual design processes. These timeline plots help to visualize and convey the process of designing. Figure 8.2 shows example design process timeline plots for students and expert designers tackling a playground design project. Each entry along the horizontal left to right timeline indicates the designer’s focus of attention across the rows of different types of activity.\n\nA significant difference that can be observed between the patterns of activities is that experienced designers, as they progress through a design project, transition back and forth across a broad range of activities throughout the whole process. There is a general overall progression from problem definition and gathering data to deciding on and communicating a final proposal, with the majority of the designer’s attention being given to modelling ideas for solutions, but their attention is also constant across all the different activities, with frequent switching between them. Atman called this a ‘cascade pattern’ that is typical of experienced designers. It shows a ‘cascade’ of the designer’s attention, generally from top-left to lower-right in the\n\n161",

It is not a simple, direct flow from problem definition through each of the other activities to communication of a final proposal.\n\nIt emerged from Atman’s studies that the development of these patterns of more experienced design behaviour can be assisted through education, developing as students progress from their first to final years of study. Figure 8.3 shows the differences in the design process timelines for one student, tackling the same two problems as a first-year and as a graduating senior student. The problems were of different levels of complexity: a relatively simple ‘Design a ping- pong ball launcher’ and a more complicated ‘Design a street crossing system’. For each problem exercise the timelines clearly show that, as a senior, the student not only spent more time on the problems but also exhibited the richer, ‘cascade’ pattern of activities.

Using a children’s playground design problem, they assessed the quality of the designs on aspects such as whether the initial constraints of the problem were met, they satisfied playground standards for specific elements of the proposed design and met expected experience outcomes for the users. Figure 8.4 shows some example timeline patterns for senior students, ranked by the assessed quality of the resulting designs. Quality assessment scores range from low (at the top), to middling, and high (at the bottom). The results show that higher solution quality scores correlate with designers using a greater range of activities and a greater intensity of transitions between activities, with attention being paid across all types of activity throughout the design process.

In analysing the activity of the experienced design team working on a digital pen project that was introduced in Chapter 2 to illustrate analogical thinking, she and her colleagues generated a timeline plot covering the joint discussion of all seven team members. Figure 8.5 shows the team’s timeline, over phases or episodes characterized by the researchers as developing changes in the team’s focus.

The timeline plot shows how the team transitioned regularly and frequently between the various types of activities throughout the process, similar to expert individual designers, with a gradual progression from problem definition into generating ideas and on to modelling and technical feasibility issues.\n\nExperience\n\nWhat we have seen throughout this book is that designing is a form of skilled behaviour. It has also become clear that, as with other skills, successful behaviours are something that can be learned. The performance of a skilled practitioner, whether musician, footballer or designer, appears to flow seamlessly, adapting their performance to the circumstances without faltering; but the learning of any skill relies on controlled practice and the development of underlying technique. It is not simply a matter of possessing ‘talent’ but comes as the result of a dedicated application to and practice in a chosen field, and the accumulation of experience.\n\nPeter Lloyd and Peter Scott found from protocol studies of architects and engineering designers that, for both, their approach appeared to be related to the amount and type of their previous experience. They found that more experienced designers used more of a conjecturing, solution-focused approach, more of what they called ‘generative’ (productive or abductive) reasoning, in contrast to the deductive reasoning employed more by less-experienced designers. They concluded that, in particular, ‘It is specific experience of the problem type that enables designers to adopt a conjectural approach to designing, that of framing or perceiving design problems in terms of relevant solutions’.\n\nClearly, part of the development of expertise lies in the accumulation of experience. Something that distinguishes experts from novices is that the experts have been exposed to a large number of examples of the problems and solutions that occur in their domain. It is a matter not just of copying from examples but of learning from them. A key competency of an expert is the mental ability to stand back from the specifics of the accumulated knowledge of precedents and form more abstract conceptualizations pertinent to their domain of expertise.",

      "content": "DESIGN EXPERTISE\n\nExperts are believed to be able to store and access information in larger ‘chunks’ than novices and to recognize underlying principles, rather than focusing on the surface features of problems. This kind of behaviour classically occurs in chess playing, where chess masters are able to survey chess board positions and recognize patterns, and strategies for resolving them, whereas novices cannot see beyond the next one or two moves.\n\nBryan Lawson has drawn parallels between expertise in chess and design, and suggested that design masters also recognize patterns in problem situations and draw upon knowledge of precedents that they have abstracted into solution principles, or ‘schemata’ as Lawson calls them. A typical design schema for an architect might be a way of organizing internal space, such as around an atrium, or for an industrial designer might be grouping together different functional parts of a product. Lawson also suggested that, like chess masters, design masters have repertoires of ‘gambits’, or ways of proceeding, of entering into and opening up the problem situation. A typical gambit might be like that of Kenneth Grange (Chapter 3), starting a new project by ‘trying to sort out just the functionality, just the handling of it, and by-and-large out of that comes a direction’.\n\nIn order to develop skilled expertise it seems that a novice needs lots and lots of practice, guided by good teachers. The novice designer also needs exposure to good examples of expert work in the domain, and needs to learn to perceive and retain these examples in terms of their underlying schemata or organizing principles. Like learning a language, it is a matter of immersion and internalizing different levels of understanding and achievement.\n\nJust as design problems are ‘ill-defined’, so expert designers appear to be ‘ill-behaved’ problem solvers. Rather than the conventional behaviours of solvers of well-defined problems, designers are solution-focused, not problem-focused. This change of focus appears to be a feature of design expertise that develops with education and experience in designing. In particular, experience in a specific type of design domain enables designers to move quickly to formulating a problem frame and proposing a solution conjecture. Successful, experienced designers are repeatedly found to be pro- active in problem framing, actively imposing a view of the problem and directing the search for solution conjectures.\n\n167",

People who prefer the certainty of structured, well-defined problems are unlikely to appreciate the delight of being a designer.\n\nDesign intelligence\n\nWhat I have attempted to show throughout this book is that design ability is a multi-faceted skill. More than that, I have tried to show that there are particular, designerly ways of thinking and working that identify designing as equivalent with other highly regarded forms of cognitive skill. In fact, it seems possible to make a reasonable claim that design ability is a form of natural intelligence, one of the kind that the psychologist Howard Gardner identified. Gardner’s view is that there is not just one form of intelligence (as conventionally identified in forms of ‘intelligence tests’), but several, relatively autonomous human intellectual competencies, including linguistic, musical, mathematical, bodily and spatial intelligences. It seems reasonable that we might add design intelligence to those.\n\nThe understanding of design expertise suggests that a designer has a high level of intelligence used to plan, review, reflect on, adapt and, above all, create novel solutions. We have seen many aspects of this design intelligence in this book. For example, we have seen that good designers have a way of thinking that involves operating across different levels of detail in a project, from high-level systemic goals to low-level physical principles. Rather than solving merely ‘the problem as given’ they apply their intelligence to the wider context and suggest imaginative, apposite solutions that resolve conflicts and uncertainties. They have cognitive skills of problem framing, of gathering and structuring problem data and creating coherent patterns from the data that indicate ways of resolving the issues and suggest possible solution concepts. Design intelligence involves an intense, reflective interaction with models and representations of problems and solutions, and an ability to shift easily and rapidly",

Good designers also apply constructive thinking not only in their individual work but also in collaboration in teamwork.\n\nThe designing brain\n\nThe nature of design intelligence becomes particularly and tragically highlighted in rare cases where it is impaired through neurological damage to the brain, such as through a stroke. One of these cases was reported by cognitive scientists Vinod Goel and Jordan Grafman, who studied an architect who had had a seizure, associated with a tumour in his right prefrontal cortex, a region at the front of the brain that is associated with high-level cognitive functions. Before his attack, this person had practised successfully as an architect but was unable to do so afterwards. In an experiment, Goel and Grafman compared his post-seizure design ability with that of a ‘control’ participant, another architect with similar education and design experience, on being given a relatively simple task of re-designing a laboratory space. The sequences of design sketches that the two architects produced are shown in Figures 8.6 and 8.7. Each began by making a survey drawing of the existing laboratory and its furniture. The healthy control participant then produced a coherent series of sketches, beginning with abstracted considerations of circulation and organization, then developing proposals and refining the preferred one. The neurological patient produced three separate, basic and incomplete proposals, finishing with a ‘final proposal’ that was still inadequate and incomplete.\n\nThe differences in the thinking processes of the two people become clear in graphs of the amount of time each devoted to different cognitive activities, as revealed by their ‘think aloud’ comments made during the experiments. These are shown in Figure 8.8. The control participant focused initially on problem structuring, with periodical returns to that throughout the process. He then moved on to preliminary design and to refinement and detailing. His graph clearly shows a complex but controlled pattern of activities, with overlap and rapid transitions between activities. In contrast, the neurologically damaged patient spent a huge amount of time on\n\n169",

In short, the patient simply could not perform the relatively simple design task.\n\nSo in this unhappy case we can see exposed some of the considerable complexity that there is in normal design thinking, and evidence that the human brain has high-level cognitive functions that control or process activities that are essential aspects of design ability and that contribute to design thinking as a form of intelligence.\n\nNeurological studies of brain activity have identified specific areas of the brain as being active during design thinking. Katerina Alexiou and her colleagues conducted such a study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brains of volunteers who performed two similar tasks that were presented in different ways: one corresponding to a well-defined problem-solving task and the other corresponding to a typically ill-defined design task.

The problem-solving version is constrained and a correct solution can be formulated; the designing version is open-ended and qualitative and can have many satisfactory solutions. The results indicated that designing and problem-solving each involve cognitive functions associated with distinct brain networks and that designing draws on a more extensive network of brain areas in the right prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is involved in complex cognitive behaviours including planning and decision making.\n\nThe two hemispheres of the brain, right and left, have different cognitive specialisms. The neural networks specific to designing appear to lie more within the right rather than the left hemisphere of the brain. Neuroscience studies tend to confirm that the right hemisphere is more specialized in spatial and constructional tasks, in aesthetic perception and emotions. The left hemisphere is more specialized in language abilities and verbal reasoning. Damage to the left hemisphere often results in the loss of some speech functions, whereas damage to the right hemisphere, as we have seen, can result, amongst other things, in the loss of design ability.\n\nA view of design thinking as a form of intelligence does not necessarily mean that some people ‘have it’ and some people do not. Design ability is something that everyone has, to some extent, because it is embedded in our brains as a natural cognitive function. Although everyone can design, like other forms of intelligence and ability design intelligence may be possessed, or may be manifested in performance, at higher levels by some people than by others. And like other forms of intelligence and ability, design intelligence is not simply a given ‘talent’ or ‘gift’ but can be trained and developed. Otherwise, what would be the point of having design schools?\n\nSummary\n\nResults from studies of expertise in creative domains such as design do not always match with results from standard studies of expertise; expert designers exhibit different strategies from conventional problem-solving.

Moving from one level to another is not necessarily a steady progression: the changes in level involve internalizing different ways of working.

      "content": "Glossary\n\nabduction/abductive As well as the two more commonly understood forms of logical reasoning – deduction and induction – there is another form known as abduction. Abductive reasoning leads to a plausible or satisfactory, but not certain, conclusion from a set of observations or problematic situation. It provides a reasonable and defensible suggestion that something may be, but not that it definitely is or must be, an appropriate conclusion. It is the rhetorical, persuasive logic of design. See pages 11, 26–7.\n\nco-evolution Both the understanding of the problematic situation and proposals for its solution co-evolve during the process of designing. Designers look for structures within the problem space that prompt complementary structures within the solution space. Iteration between the two search spaces of problem and solution proceeds in a process of co-evolution, progressively refining together both the formulation of the problem and a matching proposal for its solution. See pages 92–5.\n\nemergence Emergence occurs in designing when patterns or properties that were not explicitly included or intended are perceived in a solution conjecture. This perception can then lead to improving or developing the solution. The recognition of emergent solution features can also lead to reconsidering the problem, the co-emergence of new issues or the re-definition of requirements and the re-interpretation of the problem. See pages 12, 89.\n\nfixation A weakness in design behaviour can occur where details of known previous design solutions are inappropriately, and perhaps unconsciously, carried over into new solutions. This fixation effect can lead to inhibiting creative thought and to restricting the search space for appropriate solutions. See pages 67–70.\n\nframing Framing is a key aspect of design expertise and the central feature of reflective practice. It involves forming a viewpoint that structures the loose complexity of a problematic situation and thereby establishes a constructive coherence within the problem space. The framed viewpoint provides a perspective that also sets some boundaries on the solution space and promotes and guides the search for solution conjectures. See pages 24, 88–91.\n\nmetacognition Cognition, commonly referred to as ‘thinking’, includes\n\nmany aspects of intellectual functioning such as perception, reasoning and problem-solving. Metacognition is a higher level of",

Designers use metacognition when they reflect on their ways of acting and thinking during a design process, assess their progress and choose a particular strategy or procedure to follow. See page 142.\n\nopportunism An apparent weakness in design behaviour has been\n\ntermed opportunistic behaviour. This is observed as deviations from a structured plan or methodical process into the pursuit of issues or partial solutions that catch the designer’s attention, or as ‘drifting’ through a sequence of partial solution developments. The cognitive cost of maintaining a very broad focus may be a reason for these behaviours. It may also be a consequence of working with the ill-structuredness of design problems and should not necessarily be equated with poor design behaviour but accepted as a natural characteristic of experienced design behaviour. See pages 116, 145–6.\n\nreflective practice The theory of reflective practice proposes a model\n\nof skilled professional activity around processes of naming, framing, moving and reflecting, which iteratively move towards problem understanding and solution development. Naming identifies things of interest; framing guides subsequent activity by providing a way to perceive and shape the problem; moves generate potential solutions suggested by the frame; reflecting on the appropriateness and contextual implications of the moves assesses their validity and/or identifies more things of interest. See pages 21–2, 89.\n\nrepresentations Tentative design solution conjectures are expressed in various representations, including not only sketches and drawings but also physical prototypes and computer models. They support the uncertain, exploratory nature of conceptual design activity by externalizing and facilitating design cognition, and they store and communicate the designer’s thinking. Representations aid the generation and evaluation of solution concepts, the identification of what needs to be known about a developing concept and the recognition of emergent features and properties.
