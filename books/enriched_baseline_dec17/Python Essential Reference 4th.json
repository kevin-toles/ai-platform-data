Reminder: print(year, principal) in Python 3 \nPython is a dynamically typed language where variable names are bound to different\nvalues, possibly of varying types, during program execution.The assignment operator\nvalue is stored.The dynamic behavior of Python can be seen in Listing 1.1 with the\nstatements on the same line, as shown here:\napproach is to use the string formatting operator (%) like this:\nprint \"%3d %0.2f\" % (year, principal)\nprint(\"%3d %0.2f\" % (year, principal))   # Python 3\n\"%d\", \"%s\", and \"%f\".These sequences specify the formatting of a particular type of\ndata such as an integer, string, or floating-point number, respectively.The special-\nexample, \"%3d\" formats an integer right-aligned in a column of width 3, and \"%0.2f\"\nThe behavior of format strings is almost identical to the C printf() function and is\nprint format(year,\"3d\"),format(principal,\"0.2f\")\nprint(format(year,\"3d\"),format(principal,\"0.2f\")) # Python 3\nStrings also have a format() method that can be used to format many values at\nprint \"{0:3d} {1:0.2f}\".format(year,principal)\nprint(\"{0:3d} {1:0.2f}\".format(year,principal)) # Python 3\nTo create an empty clause, use the pass statement, as follows:\nPython does not have a special switch or case statement for testing values.To handle\nmultiple-test cases, use the elif statement, like this:\nof another object such as a string, list, or dictionary.\nThe following program opens a file and reads its contents line by line:\nf = open(\"foo.txt\")           #

machines.\nLogging Levels\nThe main focus of the logging module concerns the issuing and handling of log mes-\nlogging module.\nFor example, there are methods to issue log messages at each level as\nBefore using any other functions in the logging module, you should first perform\nresponsible for managing the default behavior of log messages including the logging\nlevel, output destination,

executed.\nLine number where the logging call executed.\nTime when the logging call executed.\nASCII-formatted date and time when the logging call was executed.\nMillisecond portion of the time when the logging call executed.\nThe logged message (supplied by user).\nHere is an example that illustrates a single configuration where log messages with a\nlevel of INFO or higher are appended to a file:\nimport logging\nlogging.basicConfig(\nfilename = \"app.log\",\nlevel    = logging.INFO\nWith this configuration, a CRITICAL log message of 'Hello World' will appear as fol-\nlows in the log file 'app.log'.\nLogger Objects\nIn order to issue log messages, you have to obtain a Logger object.This section\ndescribes the process of creating, configuring, and using these objects.\nTo create a new Logger object, you use the following function:\na new Logger instance is created and returned.\nlogging\nrequests a logger with the same name, the previously created instance is returned.This\narrangement greatly simplifies the handling of log messages in large applications because\nInstead, in each module where you want logging, you just use\nimport logging\nlog = logging.getLogger('app')\ncate the source of log messages.This can be done using statements such as this:\nimport logging\nlog = logging.getLogger('app.'+_ _name_ _)\nIssuing Log Messages\nIf log is an instance of a Logger object (created using the getLogger() function in\nthe previous section), the following methods are used to issue log messages at the differ-\nent logging levels:\nLogging Level\nlog.critical(fmt [, *args [, exc_info [, extra]]])\nlog.error(fmt [, *args [, exc_info [, extra]]])\nlog.debug(fmt [, *args [, exc_info [, extra]]])\nThe fmt argument is a format string that specifies the format of the log message.Any\nstring.The string formatting operator % is used to form the resulting message from these\nlog = logging.getLogger(\"app\")\n# A log message using positional formatting\nlog.critical(\"Can't connect to %s at port %d\", host, port)\n# A log message using dictionary formatting\nlog.critical(\"Can't connect to %(host)s at port %(port)d\", parms)\nsys.exc_info() to the log message.\nargument is a dictionary that supplies additional values for use in log message format\nWhen issuing log messages, you should avoid code that carries out string formatting\nat the time the message is issued (that is, formatting a message and then passing the\nresult into the logging module).\nlog.critical(\"Can't connect to %s at port %d\" % (host, port))\nlog.critical() because the arguments to a function or method have to be fully eval-\nformatting operation are merely passed to the logging module and used only if the log\nmany applications choose to filter log messages or only emit logs during debugging, the\nmessages on a Logger instance log.\nlog.exception(fmt [, *args ])\nIssues a message at the ERROR level but adds exception information from the current\nlog.log(level, fmt [, *args [, exc_info [, extra]]])\nIssues a logging message at the level specified by level.This can be used if the logging\nlevel is determined by a variable or if you want to have additional logging levels not\nissuing log messages—for example, if you want to add information about the location of\nthe logging call to a message.\nlogging\nFiltering Log Messages\nEach Logger object log has an internal level and filtering mechanism that determines\nwhich log messages get handled.The following two methods are used to perform sim-\nple filtering based on the numeric level of log messages:\nlog.setLevel(level)\nSets the level of log.\nOnly logging messages with a level greater than or equal to \nlogging.NOTSET which processes all log messages.\nlog.isEnabledFor(level)\nReturns True if a logging message at level level would be processed.\nLogging messages can also be filtered based on information associated with the mes-\nAdds a filter object, filt, to the logger.\nIn both methods, filt is an instance of a Filter object.\nCreates a filter that only allows log messages from logname or its children to pass\nFor example, if logname is 'app', then messages from loggers such as 'app',\nfilter(record) that receives as input a record containing information about a log-\nging message.As output, True or False is returned depending on whether or not the\nmessage should be handled.The record object passed to this method typically has the\nLine number where log message was issued\nFunction name where log message was issued\nclass FilterFunc(logging.Filter):\nlog.addFilter(FilterFunc('foo'))    # Ignore all messages originating from foo()\nlog.addFilter(FilterFunc('bar'))    # Ignore all messages originating from bar()\nIn advanced logging applications, Logger objects can be organized into a hierarchy.This\nis done by giving a logger object a name such as 'app.net.client'.\nactually three different Logger objects called 'app', 'app.net', and\nThe following attributes and methods of a Logger object log control this propaga-\nlog.propagate\nReturns the effective level of the logger.\nlevel is

the effective level of the root logger will be returned.\nwanted to shut down log messages from the 'app.net.client' part of an application,\nimport logging\nlogging.getLogger('app.net.client').propagate = False\nimport logging\nA subtle aspect of hierarchical loggers is that the decision to handle a log message is\nmade entirely by the level and filters on the Logger object on which the message was\nlogging\nimport logging\nlog = logging.getLogger('app')\nlog.setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)         # Only accept CRITICAL level messages.\nnet_log.setLevel(logging.ERROR)        # Accept ERROR messages on 'app.net'.\nWhen using hierarchical loggers, you only have to configure the logging objects where\nHowever, any Logger object can\nhave special handlers added to it that receive and process log messages.This is done\nusing these methods of a Logger instance log.\nlog.addHandler(handler)\nAdds a Handler object to the logger.\nlog.removeHandler(handler)\nRemoves the Handler object handler from the logger.\nThe logging module has a variety of pre-built handlers for writing log messages to\nfiles, streams, system logs, and so forth.These are described in further detail in the next\nimport logging\napp_log.propagate = False\n# Add some message handlers to the 'app' log\nThese go to app.log and

much\nnot the same as in Python 2.\nFor example:\nAppendix Python 3\nuse the bytes type to avoid all of the overhead and complexity of Unicode.\nIn the example, you can see how Python 3 is strictly enforcing the text/bytes separa-\nFor example, the os.listdir(dirname) function only returns file-\na byte string, then all filenames are returned as byte strings.\nPython 3 implements an entirely new I/O system, the details of which are described in\nIf you are performing any kind of I/O with text, Python 3 forces you to open files\nfiles in “binary mode” and use byte strings.A common source of errors is passing out-\nFor example:\nFile \"/tmp/lib/python3.0/io.py\", line 1035, in write\nThe print and exec statements from Python 2 are now functions.\nfunction compared to its Python 2

the result, use the list() function.\nPython 3 takes a slightly different approach to extracting key and value information\nIn Python 2, you could use methods such as d.keys(), d.values(),\nIn Python\nFor example:\n>>> s = { 'GOOG': 490.10, 'AAPL': 123.45, 'IBM': 91.10 }\nFor example:\nFor example:\nPython 3 no longer has an int type for 32-bit integers and a separate long type for\nFor
