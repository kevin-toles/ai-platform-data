# Concept Mappings

This directory contains concept-to-code mappings generated by the automated mapping pipeline.

## Files

### Generated
- `pending_review_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Mappings awaiting human review (score 0.70-0.85)

### Reviewed
- After review, approved mappings are seeded to Neo4j
- Rejected mappings are archived

## Workflow

```
1. index_repo_concepts.py     # One-time: build repo concept index
2. auto_map_concepts.py       # Per-book: extract & match concepts
3. review_mappings.py         # Interactive: approve/reject pending
```

## Confidence Thresholds

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| ≥ 0.85 | Auto-approve → Neo4j relationship |
| 0.70 - 0.85 | Queue for human review |
| < 0.70 | Discard |
